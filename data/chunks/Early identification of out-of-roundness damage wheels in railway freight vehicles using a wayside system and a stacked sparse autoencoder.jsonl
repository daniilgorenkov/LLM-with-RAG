Within this context,\nan unsupervised methodology based on artificial intelligence techniques is presented, which allows the detection and classification of wheels, based on dynamic responses induced on the track by crossing freight railway vehicles. The methodology involves the following\nsteps: (i) data collection and pre-processing, (ii) feature extraction (iii)\ndata fusion and (iv) feature discrimination. In the first phase, an FFT\nalgorithm is applied to the acceleration track responses. Then, features are extracted after training a Stacked Sparse Autoencoder, in which the main features of the responses are obtained after a compression stage using an encoder network. This lower dimensional\nlayer forces the model to learn a compression of the input data. Then,\nwhich enhances the sensitivity to the damage recognition. Posteriorly, an outlier analysis is performed to distinguish a healthy wheelRail vehicle wheels are subjected to constant wear and tear due to continuous use and inadequate maintenance plans. Over time, this wear and tear can generate more significant defects, so it is extremely important to use sensing to understand when maintenance of both the track and rolling stock is required.

However, this type of system entail high costs envisaging the vehicle wheel condition monitoring, since sensors need to be installed in every vehicle in order to achieve a good representativity . On the other hand, wayside systems are a more viable solution for identifying wheel defects, since the condition of allThe most common wheel defects are known as OOR. As the name infers, this defect is related to deformations on the surface of the wheel circumference that make it not round.\nThis deformation can have many forms and different causes, leading to faults on the vehicle and on the track due to the higher dynamic force values [4–6]. The OOR damagesa function of their shape and size, vehicle characteristics and speed [7–10]. Wheel flats induce high dynamic impact loads on the railway infrastructure, which causes significant damage to both tracks and vehicles, such as broken axles, damaged rolling bearings and cracks in the wheels, rails and sleepers . Moreover, it also generates high vibrations\ntransmitted to the rolling stock, inducing significant stresses and causing damage to the In the case of polygonal wheels, the formation mechanism can be roughly classified\ninto three categories, namely, (1) initial wheel defects , (2) a natural vibration of the\nvehicle–track system and (3) thermoelastic instability . The formation mechanism is strongly contingent on the vehicle type and its operational characteristics, withof dominant harmonic orders [19–22]. For example, Tao et al. studied asymmetrical polygonal wear on metro wheels and obtained harmonic orders of 12–14, while another study by Tao et al. found that the most common harmonic order in Chinese freight trains is 18–19. Although a polygonal wheel could generate less impact on the track than a\nwheel flat, this defect can cause serious damage to the track due to resonance effects in the\nTo identify the occurrence of these OOR anomalies in train wheels, innovative\nmethodologies have been developed combining signal processing and automatic learning techniques. These methodologies are based on the extraction of damage sensitivity features, making possible the distinction between undamaged and damaged situations. Recently, many studies have shown good results in detecting OOR damages using\ndistinct approaches [24–29]. Mishra et al. concluded that a single FBG (Fiber Bragg Grating) sensor, positioned along the rail can detect the presence of wheel flats.\nLourenço et al. created an automatic algorithm for diagnosing OOR defects. The\nproposed methodology consists of isolating specific defective wheels and then identifying the severity of the damage, using only acceleration and strain data measured on\nthe track. In another study, Krummenacher et al. , proposed two machine-learningBy extracting the features, it is possible to transform the measured data into an alternative form of information where the correlation with damage is more easily observed. There are various techniques for feature extraction, the most common being CWT\n(continuous wavelet transform) [31–33], PCA (principal component analysis) ,detection of polygonal wheels on freight vehicles using CWT and ARX features, using\n6 accelerometers, 3 on each side of the railway track. Mosleh et al. introduced aflats by extracting AR features from acceleration records. Moreover, Mohammadi et al.\nadopted linear features, particularly, CWT, PCA, ARX and AR, and their research findingsin the context of wheel flat damage detection. Although these studies have demonstrated robust results in detection, they show some limitations in dealing with the non-linear effects associated with operational effects, such as the train speed. Due to the inability of these linear techniques to attenuate operation effects, the inclusion of different speeds\nFor most of these studies, a feature normalisation stage is used when it is necessary to remove the operational effects. Usually, latent variable methods are used, such as PCA or multiple linear regression (MLR) . Thus, to deal with the non-linear phenomena and reduce the large amounts of data without relying on the aforementioned methods,\nthe first artificial neural networks were created to inherently execute this task . Over the years, new and more advanced networks have been developed, with the Autoencoder\n(AE) being one of the main types. Later, Olshausen et al. proposed the creation of\nsparse coding and Ng et al. introduced a sparse penalisation term in the hidden layer,\nto acquire more compact and effective features from lower-dimensional data. For some datasets with complex relationships between characteristics, employing more than one SAE\nis necessary, which is why stacked sparse autoencoders (SSAE) are commonly used .\nNowadays, these types of AE are widely used in various scientific fields, but specifically\nfor structural engineering only a few studies are found, and most are about damage detection on bridges [45–47]. Amaral et al. , proposed an approach for detecting structural anomalies based on SAE and Shewhart’s T control chart. The characteristics extracted byin structures. In another similar study, Amaral et al. , applied the same approach to\na numerical model of a highway viaduct in Brazil reaching more than 99% of successful classifications of structural damage with the combination of SAE and Support Vector Machine. Pathirage et al. proposed a framework utilizing SAE’s potential for dimensionality reduction, which facilitated the assessment of damage detection performance on Many of these AE algorithms already performed feature classification in order to discriminate the different types of damages and severities. However, the AE methods can also be combined with other techniques commonly used to classify the data. They can be used unsupervised methods, in which the model is trained without any labels provided to the\ntraining dataset, such as k-means , self-organising maps (SOM) , isolation forest, gaussian mixture model , k-medoids and cluster analysis , or supervised\nmethods, which assume that the hierarchy of database categories is known, such as NaiveBayes classifiers , k-Nearest Neighbours classifiers , Support Vector Machinetwo types of OOR damages, flats and polygonal wheels, based on acceleration responses obtained from a virtual wayside monitoring system.

The application of sensors on both sides of theTo obtain the responses from the railway track, it is necessary to apply sensors on the track that can measure the dynamic responses of the crossing trains. As it is not always possible\nto install them due to the high costs involved, simulations have been carried out based on calibrated models of the track , vehicle and considering their dynamic interaction,\nas well as including the track irregularities. Simulations include cases with healthy wheelsTo simulate the dynamic interactions between the vehicle and the track, an in-house software VSI – Vehicle-Structure Interaction Analysis is used, which was initially developed by\nNeves et al. and later improved by Montenegro et al. .

These equations are solved\nalongside equilibrium equations, forming a unified system that couples the two subsystems\n. Including the track irregularities directly in the constraint equations are beneficial since it avoids explicitly considering\nthem in the FEM model. Moreover, it also allows to include the wheel and OOR profiles as a periodic rail irregularity, simplifying the analysis. Thus, before starting the analysis, the\nVSI software imports track irregularities and OOR profiles from a MATLAB file, whichto the vertical and lateral irregularities in each rail in each respective position, and adds it to the constraint equations of the system throughout the dynamics analysis. Then, the\nsystem of dynamic equations is solved using the typical Newmark integration method.\nThe impact of track irregularity on wheel defect classification is significant, as a lower track quality tends to result in a higher likelihood of misclassification. A comprehensive\nexploration of this influence was previously undertaken by Mosleh et al. as documented in their research study . Hence, this study does not delve into the impact of track\nquality; rather, it primarily centres on the utilisation of AI-based methodologies for the detection and classification of wheel defects. For this, four different profiles are used, based\non European Standard EN 13848–2 . In this case, power spectral density (PSD) curvesFor OOR defects, several profiles are defined based on real measurements in representative profiles of the various severities. Subsequently, the structural matrices are imported\nMore details on track and train properties, including additional information on traintrack interaction, can be found in previous publications . Figure 1 shows the\nvehicle–track interaction model schematisation and some details about the train and track\nsubsystems, as well as the track irregularities and wheel-rail contact model.According to the conclusions reached in other studies with this type of damage ,\nthe most promising location of the sensors is on the rail. To reduce installation and maintenance costs, it is important to reduce the number of sensors without compromising the\nquality of the results. Therefore, based on a sensitivity analysis performed during the study,\nonly two vertical unidirectional accelerometers were used on each rail, 4 in total (A1 to A4),\nsince they provided a higher cost–benefit ratio. These sensors are mounted on the rail atdefects, different simulation scenarios with perfect wheels (baseline) and OOR wheels\n(damage) were defined for a five-wagon Laagrss freight train. Based on different crossing speeds, loading schemes and rail irregularities profiles, 120 baseline and 180 damage scenarios (90 for polygonal wheels and 90 for wheel flats) were defined, as summarised in For baseline scenarios, six loading schemes with five different speeds (40, 60, 80, 100\nand 120 km/h) and four rail irregularity profiles were considered, giving a total of 120 scenarios. The loading schemes used are: empty, half-loaded, full-loaded and, additionally,For the damage cases, a total of 90 scenarios were generated for polygonal wheels. These\nscenarios including 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (H1, H2 and H3) x 10 different irregularity profiles within each specified harmonic interval. In these 10 irregularity\nprofiles, based on the defect amplitude, two amplitudes are considered, five simulations for\nA1 and five simulations for A2. Similarly, 90 scenarios were created for wheel flats, involving 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (F1, F2 and F3) x 10 different irregularitywheel radius . This wave phenomenon can be characterised by the different wavelengths formed (harmonics θ ), and by the levels of irregularity ( Lw ) associated with each of the harmonics. According to Peng , it is considered a polygonal wheel when the wear amplitude assumes values above 0. mm and wavelengths between 140 mm and the wheelTo define scenarios with polygonal wheels for the Laagrss wagon, a literature survey on\nexperimental measurements in defective wheels was conducted . Three experimental irregularity profiles were collected, illustrated in Figure 3. The first group (H6-8)\ncorresponds to a study carried out by Cai et al. with dominant harmonics from 6 to 8;**Figure 3.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) of polygonal wheels with**Figure 4.** Examples of polygonal damage profiles for each of the dominant harmonic intervals.the second group (H12-14) to a study authored by Tao et al. with dominant harmonics from 12 to 14; and the third profile (H17-18) to a study performed by Wu et al. with\nBased on the wheel irregularity spectra ( Lw ) taken from the respective measurement profiles, shown in Figure 3, and considering the contribution of the first 30 harmonics, several irregularity profiles were generated, according to Figure 4.

After obtaining the acceleration measurements from the numerical simulations, an FFT algorithm is applied to the time series allowing the conversion of the signal from the time domain to the frequency domain. Then,predefined hyperparameters of the algorithm. The set hyperparameters are encoding and\ndecoding transfer functions, hidden layer size, maximum number of epochs, L2 weight regularisation term, sparsity regularisation term and a sparsity proportion term. Afterwards,**Figure 7.** Flowchart with the main phases of the methodology for detection and classification of OORthe features are extracted in the more compressed layer of the SAE, the so-called bottleneck layer. The number of features obtained is equal to the number of hidden layers which\nis usually considerably lower than the data size, allowing a compression of the input data.\nFurthermore, to enhance the sensitivity to damage, two levels of data fusion are applied to the bottleneck features using the Mahalanobis distance. In the first level, all features are\nfused into a damage index (DI) for each sensor and, in the second level, all the sensors\nare merged resulting in only one DI for each simulation. Finally, automatic damage detection is achieved by performing an outlier analysis, in which a statistical confidence limit\n(CB) is used, based on the Inverse Cumulative Gaussian Distribution Function (ICDF).\nFor feature classification, an automatic clustering process based on the k-means technique is implemented. This algorithm allows for the unsupervised and automatic classification of data, based on the calculation of statistical distances between objects. In k-means technique given a vector of data and chosen k clusters, the key is to find k centroids that minimise\nthe distance of each vector to its nearest centroid . Since it is necessary to define the number of clusters in advance, a global Silhouette index (SIL) was adopted to make\nan automatic process. At the end, the clusters will allow the classification of the two typesbetween the number of correct classifications and the total number of cases.damage detection problems, as it allows a signal to be converted from the time domain to the frequency domain, to capture the excitation frequencies induced by the wheel defects.\nIn addition, a data reduction is carried out at this stage, since the initial records contain aa crossing speed of 80 km/h. When comparing the FFT spectra for a train passage with flats, Figure 8a), with polygonal wheels, Figure 8b), there are visible differences in terms\nof amplitude peak values and excited frequency ranges. For flats, the amplitude peak values are higher and they induce frequencies in the range between DC and 1500accordance with some authors reports . In terms of severities, for flats, the more severe group (55–100 mm) is the one with the higher frequency content, as expected,a baseline response. For polygonal wheels, from the analysis of Figure 8b), it can be seen the frequency peaks for the H12–14 and H17–18 profiles around 100 and 150\nrespectively, while for the profile H6-8 a more flat spectrum is obtained without showing any significant peak. This can be explained by the irregularity level profile of thisThese two graphs can show which frequencies have higher content in the original signal.Autoencoders are artificial neural networks trained using an unsupervised approach,\nwhich aim first to learn coded representations of the data, compressing the input into\na latent space representation, and second, through this compressed information, reconstructing the information. The basic architecture of this type of network consists of threewhere **Wij**, **Wjk** are the weights connection matrices between input layer-hidden\nlayer and hidden layer-output layer, **X** = ( **X** 1, **X** 2, . . ., **Xn** ) is the input data vector,\n**H** = ( **H** 1, . . ., **Hm** ) is the low-dimensional vector and **X** [ˆ] = ( **X** [ˆ] 1, **X** [ˆ] 2, . . ., **X** [ˆ] **n** ) is the output**Figure 8.** Frequency domain responses on position 1 for the crossing speed of 80 km/h: (a) wheel flats,data vector. **b** 1, **b** 2 are bias vectors and σ 1, σ 2 are the activation function used in each of thereconstruction of the input X [ˆ], as shown in Equation (3).

After incorporating various inputs into the SSAE training, they are integrated into the so-called\n‘Input 1’. As training progresses, the data is compressed, and the main characteristics of the signals are obtained and retained in ‘Bottleneck 1’. Subsequently, these characteristics are\nused as input for training the second sparse autoencoder, which, after further compression,\nenables the extraction of the final features. Depending on the type of data under analysis,\nthe compression level differs, so multiple tests should be conducted to optimise these layer sizes. This optimisation was achieved by trial and test, changing both the size of the first\nIt should be noted that this network architecture, where the dimensions of the layers gradually decrease along the network until reaching the bottleneck layer , has proven\nto be highly robust for the type of data used. It allows for effective compression of results**Figure 9.** Schematic of the structure of the SSAE neural network used in this study.After extracting the features from the bottleneck layer of the SSAE, the difference between the healthy wheels scenarios and the damage wheels scenarios is still not sufficient. Hence\na data fusion is performed. With this fusion, it is possible to increase the sensitivity of the\nfeatures, and as a result, to obtain a damage index (DI) for each simulation. Thus, the Mahalanobis distance (MD) is used to reduce the volume of extracted data and preserve the most relevant information . Briefly, MD is a metric that measures the distance between two points in a feature space consisting of two or more variables, being independent of the\nscale of the features, thus allowing an increase in the sensitivity of the features to cases with damage. The MD, denoted here as DI, is calculated for each simulation using the followingin which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−], and ¯ x is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The MD is calculated for each sensor and for each simulation, obtaining a matrix of n distances per k number of sensors.Finally, the discrimination of the features consists in distinguishing the features as corresponding to a healthy or damaged case. At this stage of the methodology, an analysis of\nabnormal values is carried out, which will allow the condition of the train wheels to beautomatically monitored and these values to be classified into different classes. This phaseThe outlier analysis consists of grouping, by probabilistic distribution processes, the datato the previously created group. For this, a statistical confidence limit (CB) is used, based on the inverse cumulative Gaussian distribution function (ICDF), considering the mean\nvalue, ¯ μ, and standard deviation, σ, of the baseline feature vector.Whenever a value of a DI indicator is equal to or greater than CB, it is considered an outlier (the null hypothesis is rejected), thus representing a case of damage.For feature classification, a clustering process is used to divide the dataset into distinct clusters that should be as compact and separated as possible . For clustering, the k-meanson the distances of their vectors. Recent studies showed that the k-means algorithm has shown promising results . The main limitation of this technique is that it requires\nknowledge of the number of clusters in advance. For this purpose, the global silhouetteThis section presents the main results obtained through the application of the methodology proposed in section 3 to the calculated track responses. The methodology is applied using damaged wheel passages for the three simulated train speeds (60, 80 and 100 km/h),hyperparameters (presented in section 3). By adjusting these hyperparameters, it is possible to make the algorithm more efficient and improve the generalisation capabilities, as only\nthe most important features are retained. The optimisation of these hyperparameters isof data under analysis. Based on the principles of the SAE already outlined in other works\nIn the context of this study, the non-linear transfer functions (logsig) proved to be more effective than the linear ones, being the ones used in all the studied cases. After analysing Table 3, there is a similarity in the hyperparameters when comparing the two types of OOR damage. It is observed that the data compression level is the same for both cases, around\n93%, as 500 features are extracted in Bottleneck 2 from the initial input data with 7000\nConcerning the type of damage situation, the size of the ‘Bottleneck 1’ and ‘Bottleneck\n2’ was increased to bring them even closer to the initial amount of input data. This can beanalysis, making it challenging for the autoencoder to define relationships between the data, hence requiring a larger number. On the contrary, the maximum number of epochsIt is also important to emphasise that of the various hyperparameters presented, theOnce the hyperparameters have been defined, all the steps of the methodology are applied to the new dataset. For simplicity, in this section, only the last phase of the methodology will be presented, namely an outlier analysis for damage detection and cluster analysis for damage classification. For each sensor, a matrix n × m is created, where n\nis the number of test passages (baseline scenarios + damage scenarios), and m represents the number of extracted features. So, the size of the matrices is 210 × 2000 in case of the\ntype of damage, 75 × 500 for each amplitude in polygonal wheel, and 120 × 500 for wheelDespite the visual distinction between healthy and damaged wheels based on the data processing presented in subsection 3.2, unsupervised learning must use strategies capable of automatically detecting damage. To this end, an outlier analysis is employed, which consists of defining a confidence threshold using a significance level of 1% , represented**Figure 10.** Automatic OOR damage detection based on outlier analysis.by the green line in Figure 10. This approach makes it possible to successfully detect allTo distinguish the two types of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed. Figure 11\nshows a clear distinction between the damage, even when using a dataset with three different train speeds (60,80 and 100 km/h).. In the case of Figure 11a), using all four\naccelerometers, it is possible to efficiently separate the set into two large clusters, despite\n30 misclassifications (16 in the polygonisation and 14 in the flats). Even so, the accuracy\npercentage is around 85%, which is a very good result. To analyse the sensitivity to the number of sensors, only two sensors were used, one on each side ). The results\nimproved, with a decrease in the number of misclassifications from 30 to 21 (13 for polygonisation and 8 for flats). One explanation could be the disparity in sensor sensitivity to the damage, where some sensors are more sensitive than others due to their spatial positioning in relation to the damage. By merging the data from the less sensitive sensors with the\nmore sensitive ones, this could have a negative impact on the results. Thus, the percentage\nThe purpose behind presenting these two plots was to demonstrate that, whether using 4 sensors or 2 sensors, the classification remains remarkably robust, showing lowAfter identifying the type of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed once again to\nclassify the severity of each damage separately. Regarding polygonal wheels, the classification involves both amplitude and harmonic orders, leading to the clusters depicted in the obtained clusters reasonably reflect the two amplitude groups, with all misclassifications associated with the H6-8 harmonic cases (17 misclassifications). Once the amplitude\nis identified, harmonic classification must be carried out separately for each of the amplitudes. In Figure 12b), related to amplitude A1, it is observed that the obtained clusters**Figure 11.** Automatic OOR damage classification based on cluster analysis using: a) 4 sensors; b) 2are nearly perfect, with only 3 misclassifications. In Figure 12c), there are only 3 misclassifications, totalling 8 misclassifications in the classification of the number of dominant\nThe classification of harmonic order is only possible with the separation of amplitudes,\nFigure 13 presents the clusters obtained for the wheel flat cases. The separation between\nthe less severe group and baseline cases and intermediate (cluster 3) and severe cases (cluster 4) is reduced, resulting in a total of 19 misclassifications. Nevertheless, this result showsrate of about 84%. One possible reason for this significant number of misclassifications could be directly associated with the number of impacts captured by the sensor.In order to contribute to the safety of railway transportation and service quality, an automatic methodology based on machine learning has been proposed. This methodology can accurately detect and classify two types of OOR wheel damage in railway vehicles allowing to mitigate problems at both track and vehicle level, such as derailments or material\ndegradation. It includes a new technique for feature extraction based on a dedicated neural network, the Sparse Autoencoder. This non-linear technique is an upgrade concerning the commonly used linear techniques for feature extraction since it allows a better normalisation of the operational effects in the analysed data, as well as the reduction of large amounts\nof data without relying on other techniques, while keeping the most valuable information. These improvements are achieved through the use of different hyperparameters in**Figure 12.** Automatic classification of polygonal wheels based on cluster analysis: a) amplitude A1-A2;**Figure 13.** Automatic classification of wheel flats based on cluster analysis.the calculations, such as non-linear activation functions and sparsity terms. Consequently,circulation. Particularly in the railway engineering field, the inclusion of this technique\nshowed a good potential to deal with variable train speeds, essentially due to the amplifying effect on the measured track dynamic responses which could induce errors in damage The application of the methodology to the data set proved to be very successful in detecting and classifying the two types of OOR damages. Damage detection was perfect, without\nany false detection. In terms of classifying the type of damage, the results are very good,\nwith a success rate of around 85%, but if only two accelerometers are considered the successrate increases to around 90%. These results are encouraging since the range of speeds considered in the analysis, between 60 and 100 km/h, is the most representative of in-service\nfreight trains. Also, the results show that including the Sparse Autoencoder has a positive\neffect in the normalization of the train speed in the damage data set.\nRegarding the severity classification for each type of damage, the methodology proved equally successful in clustering the different damage severities. For polygonal wheels, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the severity groups in terms of defect amplitude, failing only for the H6-8 harmonic cases, and in terms of harmonic orders for each amplitude,\nwith almost perfect results. For wheel flats, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the three severity groups, though with some misclassifications between the less severe group\nand baseline cases and between intermediate and severe cases. A success rate of around 86%\nis achieved in the classification of polygonal wheel severities and 84% in the classification of wheel flat severities. Even so, these high success rates of over 80% show the robustness\nof this methodology in damage classification regardless of the train speed.on on-site measurements. Additionally, this methodology could be carried out for other types of railway vehicles, for example, passenger vehicles, since the dynamic responses are\ndifferent from freight vehicles. In that case, exploring other recent types of autoencoders,\nTo increase the complexity of the problem, the objective is to explore the concept of\nmultiple damages (same or different OOR types). For this, it will be necessary to incorporate a new stage in the methodology, the damage location stage, which will make it possible\nto distinguish isolated damage from multiple damage, as well as their respective location.\nThus, damage will be identified using cut signals, which will then be used to classify theThis work is a result of project WAY4SafeRail-WAYside monitoring system FOR SAFE RAIL transportation, with reference NORTE-01-0247-FEDER-069595, co-funded by the European Regional\nDevelopment Fund (ERDF), through the North Portugal Regional Operational Programme\nPartnership Agreement.

However, this type of system entail high costs envisaging the vehicle wheel condition monitoring, since sensors need to be installed in every vehicle in order to achieve a good representativity . On the other hand, wayside systems are a more viable solution for identifying wheel defects, since the condition of allThe most common wheel defects are known as OOR. As the name infers, this defect is related to deformations on the surface of the wheel circumference that make it not round.\nThis deformation can have many forms and different causes, leading to faults on the vehicle and on the track due to the higher dynamic force values [4–6]. The OOR damagesa function of their shape and size, vehicle characteristics and speed [7–10]. Wheel flats induce high dynamic impact loads on the railway infrastructure, which causes significant damage to both tracks and vehicles, such as broken axles, damaged rolling bearings and cracks in the wheels, rails and sleepers . Moreover, it also generates high vibrations\ntransmitted to the rolling stock, inducing significant stresses and causing damage to the In the case of polygonal wheels, the formation mechanism can be roughly classified\ninto three categories, namely, (1) initial wheel defects , (2) a natural vibration of the\nvehicle–track system and (3) thermoelastic instability . The formation mechanism is strongly contingent on the vehicle type and its operational characteristics, withof dominant harmonic orders [19–22]. For example, Tao et al. studied asymmetrical polygonal wear on metro wheels and obtained harmonic orders of 12–14, while another study by Tao et al. found that the most common harmonic order in Chinese freight trains is 18–19. Although a polygonal wheel could generate less impact on the track than a\nwheel flat, this defect can cause serious damage to the track due to resonance effects in the\nTo identify the occurrence of these OOR anomalies in train wheels, innovative\nmethodologies have been developed combining signal processing and automatic learning techniques. These methodologies are based on the extraction of damage sensitivity features, making possible the distinction between undamaged and damaged situations. Recently, many studies have shown good results in detecting OOR damages using\ndistinct approaches [24–29]. Mishra et al. concluded that a single FBG (Fiber Bragg Grating) sensor, positioned along the rail can detect the presence of wheel flats.\nLourenço et al. created an automatic algorithm for diagnosing OOR defects. The\nproposed methodology consists of isolating specific defective wheels and then identifying the severity of the damage, using only acceleration and strain data measured on\nthe track. In another study, Krummenacher et al. , proposed two machine-learningBy extracting the features, it is possible to transform the measured data into an alternative form of information where the correlation with damage is more easily observed. There are various techniques for feature extraction, the most common being CWT\n(continuous wavelet transform) [31–33], PCA (principal component analysis) ,detection of polygonal wheels on freight vehicles using CWT and ARX features, using\n6 accelerometers, 3 on each side of the railway track. Mosleh et al. introduced aflats by extracting AR features from acceleration records. Moreover, Mohammadi et al.\nadopted linear features, particularly, CWT, PCA, ARX and AR, and their research findingsin the context of wheel flat damage detection. Although these studies have demonstrated robust results in detection, they show some limitations in dealing with the non-linear effects associated with operational effects, such as the train speed. Due to the inability of these linear techniques to attenuate operation effects, the inclusion of different speeds\nFor most of these studies, a feature normalisation stage is used when it is necessary to remove the operational effects. Usually, latent variable methods are used, such as PCA or multiple linear regression (MLR) . Thus, to deal with the non-linear phenomena and reduce the large amounts of data without relying on the aforementioned methods,\nthe first artificial neural networks were created to inherently execute this task . Over the years, new and more advanced networks have been developed, with the Autoencoder\n(AE) being one of the main types. Later, Olshausen et al. proposed the creation of\nsparse coding and Ng et al. introduced a sparse penalisation term in the hidden layer,\nto acquire more compact and effective features from lower-dimensional data. For some datasets with complex relationships between characteristics, employing more than one SAE\nis necessary, which is why stacked sparse autoencoders (SSAE) are commonly used .\nNowadays, these types of AE are widely used in various scientific fields, but specifically\nfor structural engineering only a few studies are found, and most are about damage detection on bridges [45–47].

Pathirage et al. proposed a framework utilizing SAE’s potential for dimensionality reduction, which facilitated the assessment of damage detection performance on Many of these AE algorithms already performed feature classification in order to discriminate the different types of damages and severities. However, the AE methods can also be combined with other techniques commonly used to classify the data. They can be used unsupervised methods, in which the model is trained without any labels provided to the\ntraining dataset, such as k-means , self-organising maps (SOM) , isolation forest, gaussian mixture model , k-medoids and cluster analysis , or supervised\nmethods, which assume that the hierarchy of database categories is known, such as NaiveBayes classifiers , k-Nearest Neighbours classifiers , Support Vector Machinetwo types of OOR damages, flats and polygonal wheels, based on acceleration responses obtained from a virtual wayside monitoring system.

The application of sensors on both sides of theTo obtain the responses from the railway track, it is necessary to apply sensors on the track that can measure the dynamic responses of the crossing trains. As it is not always possible\nto install them due to the high costs involved, simulations have been carried out based on calibrated models of the track , vehicle and considering their dynamic interaction,\nas well as including the track irregularities. Simulations include cases with healthy wheelsTo simulate the dynamic interactions between the vehicle and the track, an in-house software VSI – Vehicle-Structure Interaction Analysis is used, which was initially developed by\nNeves et al. and later improved by Montenegro et al. .

Using Lagrange multipliers, this tool connects\nwheel displacements with the track nodal displacements, incorporating track irregularities and OOR profiles through a set of constraint equations. These equations are solved\nalongside equilibrium equations, forming a unified system that couples the two subsystems\n. Including the track irregularities directly in the constraint equations are beneficial since it avoids explicitly considering\nthem in the FEM model. Moreover, it also allows to include the wheel and OOR profiles as a periodic rail irregularity, simplifying the analysis. Thus, before starting the analysis, the\nVSI software imports track irregularities and OOR profiles from a MATLAB file, whichto the vertical and lateral irregularities in each rail in each respective position, and adds it to the constraint equations of the system throughout the dynamics analysis. Then, the\nsystem of dynamic equations is solved using the typical Newmark integration method.\nThe impact of track irregularity on wheel defect classification is significant, as a lower track quality tends to result in a higher likelihood of misclassification. A comprehensive\nexploration of this influence was previously undertaken by Mosleh et al. as documented in their research study . Hence, this study does not delve into the impact of track\nquality; rather, it primarily centres on the utilisation of AI-based methodologies for the detection and classification of wheel defects. For this, four different profiles are used, based\non European Standard EN 13848–2 . In this case, power spectral density (PSD) curvesFor OOR defects, several profiles are defined based on real measurements in representative profiles of the various severities. Subsequently, the structural matrices are imported\nMore details on track and train properties, including additional information on traintrack interaction, can be found in previous publications . Figure 1 shows the\nvehicle–track interaction model schematisation and some details about the train and track\nsubsystems, as well as the track irregularities and wheel-rail contact model.According to the conclusions reached in other studies with this type of damage ,\nthe most promising location of the sensors is on the rail. To reduce installation and maintenance costs, it is important to reduce the number of sensors without compromising the\nquality of the results. Therefore, based on a sensitivity analysis performed during the study,\nonly two vertical unidirectional accelerometers were used on each rail, 4 in total (A1 to A4),\nsince they provided a higher cost–benefit ratio. These sensors are mounted on the rail atdefects, different simulation scenarios with perfect wheels (baseline) and OOR wheels\n(damage) were defined for a five-wagon Laagrss freight train. Based on different crossing speeds, loading schemes and rail irregularities profiles, 120 baseline and 180 damage scenarios (90 for polygonal wheels and 90 for wheel flats) were defined, as summarised in For baseline scenarios, six loading schemes with five different speeds (40, 60, 80, 100\nand 120 km/h) and four rail irregularity profiles were considered, giving a total of 120 scenarios. The loading schemes used are: empty, half-loaded, full-loaded and, additionally,For the damage cases, a total of 90 scenarios were generated for polygonal wheels. These\nscenarios including 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (H1, H2 and H3) x 10 different irregularity profiles within each specified harmonic interval. In these 10 irregularity\nprofiles, based on the defect amplitude, two amplitudes are considered, five simulations for\nA1 and five simulations for A2. Similarly, 90 scenarios were created for wheel flats, involving 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (F1, F2 and F3) x 10 different irregularitywheel radius . This wave phenomenon can be characterised by the different wavelengths formed (harmonics θ ), and by the levels of irregularity ( Lw ) associated with each of the harmonics. According to Peng , it is considered a polygonal wheel when the wear amplitude assumes values above 0. mm and wavelengths between 140 mm and the wheelTo define scenarios with polygonal wheels for the Laagrss wagon, a literature survey on\nexperimental measurements in defective wheels was conducted . Three experimental irregularity profiles were collected, illustrated in Figure 3. The first group (H6-8)\ncorresponds to a study carried out by Cai et al. with dominant harmonics from 6 to 8;**Figure 3.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) of polygonal wheels with**Figure 4.** Examples of polygonal damage profiles for each of the dominant harmonic intervals.the second group (H12-14) to a study authored by Tao et al. with dominant harmonics from 12 to 14; and the third profile (H17-18) to a study performed by Wu et al. with\nBased on the wheel irregularity spectra ( Lw ) taken from the respective measurement profiles, shown in Figure 3, and considering the contribution of the first 30 harmonics, several irregularity profiles were generated, according to Figure 4.

The amplifying effect\nof speed can influence the identification of damage, which is why a robust baseline with a wide range of scenarios is very important. At a speed of 40 km/h, lower accelerations\naround 0. m/s⊃2 are observed. In contrast, at a speed of 100 km/h (considerably higher),\naccelerations increase substantially to around 3. m/s⊃2.

Then,predefined hyperparameters of the algorithm. The set hyperparameters are encoding and\ndecoding transfer functions, hidden layer size, maximum number of epochs, L2 weight regularisation term, sparsity regularisation term and a sparsity proportion term. Afterwards,**Figure 7.** Flowchart with the main phases of the methodology for detection and classification of OORthe features are extracted in the more compressed layer of the SAE, the so-called bottleneck layer. The number of features obtained is equal to the number of hidden layers which\nis usually considerably lower than the data size, allowing a compression of the input data.\nFurthermore, to enhance the sensitivity to damage, two levels of data fusion are applied to the bottleneck features using the Mahalanobis distance. In the first level, all features are\nfused into a damage index (DI) for each sensor and, in the second level, all the sensors\nare merged resulting in only one DI for each simulation. Finally, automatic damage detection is achieved by performing an outlier analysis, in which a statistical confidence limit\n(CB) is used, based on the Inverse Cumulative Gaussian Distribution Function (ICDF).\nFor feature classification, an automatic clustering process based on the k-means technique is implemented. This algorithm allows for the unsupervised and automatic classification of data, based on the calculation of statistical distances between objects. In k-means technique given a vector of data and chosen k clusters, the key is to find k centroids that minimise\nthe distance of each vector to its nearest centroid . Since it is necessary to define the number of clusters in advance, a global Silhouette index (SIL) was adopted to make\nan automatic process. At the end, the clusters will allow the classification of the two typesbetween the number of correct classifications and the total number of cases.damage detection problems, as it allows a signal to be converted from the time domain to the frequency domain, to capture the excitation frequencies induced by the wheel defects.\nIn addition, a data reduction is carried out at this stage, since the initial records contain aa crossing speed of 80 km/h. When comparing the FFT spectra for a train passage with flats, Figure 8a), with polygonal wheels, Figure 8b), there are visible differences in terms\nof amplitude peak values and excited frequency ranges. For flats, the amplitude peak values are higher and they induce frequencies in the range between DC and 1500accordance with some authors reports . In terms of severities, for flats, the more severe group (55–100 mm) is the one with the higher frequency content, as expected,a baseline response. For polygonal wheels, from the analysis of Figure 8b), it can be seen the frequency peaks for the H12–14 and H17–18 profiles around 100 and 150\nrespectively, while for the profile H6-8 a more flat spectrum is obtained without showing any significant peak. This can be explained by the irregularity level profile of thisThese two graphs can show which frequencies have higher content in the original signal.Autoencoders are artificial neural networks trained using an unsupervised approach,\nwhich aim first to learn coded representations of the data, compressing the input into\na latent space representation, and second, through this compressed information, reconstructing the information.

After incorporating various inputs into the SSAE training, they are integrated into the so-called\n‘Input 1’. As training progresses, the data is compressed, and the main characteristics of the signals are obtained and retained in ‘Bottleneck 1’. Subsequently, these characteristics are\nused as input for training the second sparse autoencoder, which, after further compression,\nenables the extraction of the final features. Depending on the type of data under analysis,\nthe compression level differs, so multiple tests should be conducted to optimise these layer sizes. This optimisation was achieved by trial and test, changing both the size of the first\nIt should be noted that this network architecture, where the dimensions of the layers gradually decrease along the network until reaching the bottleneck layer , has proven\nto be highly robust for the type of data used. It allows for effective compression of results**Figure 9.** Schematic of the structure of the SSAE neural network used in this study.After extracting the features from the bottleneck layer of the SSAE, the difference between the healthy wheels scenarios and the damage wheels scenarios is still not sufficient. Hence\na data fusion is performed. With this fusion, it is possible to increase the sensitivity of the\nfeatures, and as a result, to obtain a damage index (DI) for each simulation. Thus, the Mahalanobis distance (MD) is used to reduce the volume of extracted data and preserve the most relevant information . Briefly, MD is a metric that measures the distance between two points in a feature space consisting of two or more variables, being independent of the\nscale of the features, thus allowing an increase in the sensitivity of the features to cases with damage. The MD, denoted here as DI, is calculated for each simulation using the followingin which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−], and ¯ x is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The MD is calculated for each sensor and for each simulation, obtaining a matrix of n distances per k number of sensors.Finally, the discrimination of the features consists in distinguishing the features as corresponding to a healthy or damaged case. At this stage of the methodology, an analysis of\nabnormal values is carried out, which will allow the condition of the train wheels to beautomatically monitored and these values to be classified into different classes. This phaseThe outlier analysis consists of grouping, by probabilistic distribution processes, the datato the previously created group. For this, a statistical confidence limit (CB) is used, based on the inverse cumulative Gaussian distribution function (ICDF), considering the mean\nvalue, ¯ μ, and standard deviation, σ, of the baseline feature vector.Whenever a value of a DI indicator is equal to or greater than CB, it is considered an outlier (the null hypothesis is rejected), thus representing a case of damage.For feature classification, a clustering process is used to divide the dataset into distinct clusters that should be as compact and separated as possible . For clustering, the k-meanson the distances of their vectors. Recent studies showed that the k-means algorithm has shown promising results . The main limitation of this technique is that it requires\nknowledge of the number of clusters in advance. For this purpose, the global silhouetteThis section presents the main results obtained through the application of the methodology proposed in section 3 to the calculated track responses. The methodology is applied using damaged wheel passages for the three simulated train speeds (60, 80 and 100 km/h),hyperparameters (presented in section 3). By adjusting these hyperparameters, it is possible to make the algorithm more efficient and improve the generalisation capabilities, as only\nthe most important features are retained. The optimisation of these hyperparameters isof data under analysis. Based on the principles of the SAE already outlined in other works\nIn the context of this study, the non-linear transfer functions (logsig) proved to be more effective than the linear ones, being the ones used in all the studied cases. After analysing Table 3, there is a similarity in the hyperparameters when comparing the two types of OOR damage. It is observed that the data compression level is the same for both cases, around\n93%, as 500 features are extracted in Bottleneck 2 from the initial input data with 7000\nConcerning the type of damage situation, the size of the ‘Bottleneck 1’ and ‘Bottleneck\n2’ was increased to bring them even closer to the initial amount of input data. This can beanalysis, making it challenging for the autoencoder to define relationships between the data, hence requiring a larger number. On the contrary, the maximum number of epochsIt is also important to emphasise that of the various hyperparameters presented, theOnce the hyperparameters have been defined, all the steps of the methodology are applied to the new dataset. For simplicity, in this section, only the last phase of the methodology will be presented, namely an outlier analysis for damage detection and cluster analysis for damage classification. For each sensor, a matrix n × m is created, where n\nis the number of test passages (baseline scenarios + damage scenarios), and m represents the number of extracted features. So, the size of the matrices is 210 × 2000 in case of the\ntype of damage, 75 × 500 for each amplitude in polygonal wheel, and 120 × 500 for wheelDespite the visual distinction between healthy and damaged wheels based on the data processing presented in subsection 3.2, unsupervised learning must use strategies capable of automatically detecting damage. To this end, an outlier analysis is employed, which consists of defining a confidence threshold using a significance level of 1% , represented**Figure 10.** Automatic OOR damage detection based on outlier analysis.by the green line in Figure 10. This approach makes it possible to successfully detect allTo distinguish the two types of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed. Figure 11\nshows a clear distinction between the damage, even when using a dataset with three different train speeds (60,80 and 100 km/h).. In the case of Figure 11a), using all four\naccelerometers, it is possible to efficiently separate the set into two large clusters, despite\n30 misclassifications (16 in the polygonisation and 14 in the flats). Even so, the accuracy\npercentage is around 85%, which is a very good result. To analyse the sensitivity to the number of sensors, only two sensors were used, one on each side ). The results\nimproved, with a decrease in the number of misclassifications from 30 to 21 (13 for polygonisation and 8 for flats). One explanation could be the disparity in sensor sensitivity to the damage, where some sensors are more sensitive than others due to their spatial positioning in relation to the damage. By merging the data from the less sensitive sensors with the\nmore sensitive ones, this could have a negative impact on the results. Thus, the percentage\nThe purpose behind presenting these two plots was to demonstrate that, whether using 4 sensors or 2 sensors, the classification remains remarkably robust, showing lowAfter identifying the type of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed once again to\nclassify the severity of each damage separately. Regarding polygonal wheels, the classification involves both amplitude and harmonic orders, leading to the clusters depicted in the obtained clusters reasonably reflect the two amplitude groups, with all misclassifications associated with the H6-8 harmonic cases (17 misclassifications). Once the amplitude\nis identified, harmonic classification must be carried out separately for each of the amplitudes. In Figure 12b), related to amplitude A1, it is observed that the obtained clusters**Figure 11.** Automatic OOR damage classification based on cluster analysis using: a) 4 sensors; b) 2are nearly perfect, with only 3 misclassifications. In Figure 12c), there are only 3 misclassifications, totalling 8 misclassifications in the classification of the number of dominant\nThe classification of harmonic order is only possible with the separation of amplitudes,\nFigure 13 presents the clusters obtained for the wheel flat cases. The separation between\nthe less severe group and baseline cases and intermediate (cluster 3) and severe cases (cluster 4) is reduced, resulting in a total of 19 misclassifications. Nevertheless, this result showsrate of about 84%. One possible reason for this significant number of misclassifications could be directly associated with the number of impacts captured by the sensor.In order to contribute to the safety of railway transportation and service quality, an automatic methodology based on machine learning has been proposed. This methodology can accurately detect and classify two types of OOR wheel damage in railway vehicles allowing to mitigate problems at both track and vehicle level, such as derailments or material\ndegradation. It includes a new technique for feature extraction based on a dedicated neural network, the Sparse Autoencoder. This non-linear technique is an upgrade concerning the commonly used linear techniques for feature extraction since it allows a better normalisation of the operational effects in the analysed data, as well as the reduction of large amounts\nof data without relying on other techniques, while keeping the most valuable information. These improvements are achieved through the use of different hyperparameters in**Figure 12.** Automatic classification of polygonal wheels based on cluster analysis: a) amplitude A1-A2;**Figure 13.** Automatic classification of wheel flats based on cluster analysis.the calculations, such as non-linear activation functions and sparsity terms. Consequently,circulation. Particularly in the railway engineering field, the inclusion of this technique\nshowed a good potential to deal with variable train speeds, essentially due to the amplifying effect on the measured track dynamic responses which could induce errors in damage The application of the methodology to the data set proved to be very successful in detecting and classifying the two types of OOR damages. Damage detection was perfect, without\nany false detection. In terms of classifying the type of damage, the results are very good,\nwith a success rate of around 85%, but if only two accelerometers are considered the successrate increases to around 90%. These results are encouraging since the range of speeds considered in the analysis, between 60 and 100 km/h, is the most representative of in-service\nfreight trains. Also, the results show that including the Sparse Autoencoder has a positive\neffect in the normalization of the train speed in the damage data set.\nRegarding the severity classification for each type of damage, the methodology proved equally successful in clustering the different damage severities. For polygonal wheels, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the severity groups in terms of defect amplitude, failing only for the H6-8 harmonic cases, and in terms of harmonic orders for each amplitude,\nwith almost perfect results. For wheel flats, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the three severity groups, though with some misclassifications between the less severe group\nand baseline cases and between intermediate and severe cases. A success rate of around 86%\nis achieved in the classification of polygonal wheel severities and 84% in the classification of wheel flat severities. Even so, these high success rates of over 80% show the robustness\nof this methodology in damage classification regardless of the train speed.on on-site measurements. Additionally, this methodology could be carried out for other types of railway vehicles, for example, passenger vehicles, since the dynamic responses are\ndifferent from freight vehicles. In that case, exploring other recent types of autoencoders,\nTo increase the complexity of the problem, the objective is to explore the concept of\nmultiple damages (same or different OOR types). For this, it will be necessary to incorporate a new stage in the methodology, the damage location stage, which will make it possible\nto distinguish isolated damage from multiple damage, as well as their respective location.\nThus, damage will be identified using cut signals, which will then be used to classify theThis work is a result of project WAY4SafeRail-WAYside monitoring system FOR SAFE RAIL transportation, with reference NORTE-01-0247-FEDER-069595, co-funded by the European Regional\nDevelopment Fund (ERDF), through the North Portugal Regional Operational Programme\nPartnership Agreement.

However, this type of system entail high costs envisaging the vehicle wheel condition monitoring, since sensors need to be installed in every vehicle in order to achieve a good representativity . On the other hand, wayside systems are a more viable solution for identifying wheel defects, since the condition of allThe most common wheel defects are known as OOR. As the name infers, this defect is related to deformations on the surface of the wheel circumference that make it not round.\nThis deformation can have many forms and different causes, leading to faults on the vehicle and on the track due to the higher dynamic force values [4–6]. The OOR damagesa function of their shape and size, vehicle characteristics and speed [7–10]. Wheel flats induce high dynamic impact loads on the railway infrastructure, which causes significant damage to both tracks and vehicles, such as broken axles, damaged rolling bearings and cracks in the wheels, rails and sleepers . Moreover, it also generates high vibrations\ntransmitted to the rolling stock, inducing significant stresses and causing damage to the In the case of polygonal wheels, the formation mechanism can be roughly classified\ninto three categories, namely, (1) initial wheel defects , (2) a natural vibration of the\nvehicle–track system and (3) thermoelastic instability . The formation mechanism is strongly contingent on the vehicle type and its operational characteristics, withof dominant harmonic orders [19–22]. For example, Tao et al. studied asymmetrical polygonal wear on metro wheels and obtained harmonic orders of 12–14, while another study by Tao et al. found that the most common harmonic order in Chinese freight trains is 18–19. Although a polygonal wheel could generate less impact on the track than a\nwheel flat, this defect can cause serious damage to the track due to resonance effects in the\nTo identify the occurrence of these OOR anomalies in train wheels, innovative\nmethodologies have been developed combining signal processing and automatic learning techniques. These methodologies are based on the extraction of damage sensitivity features, making possible the distinction between undamaged and damaged situations. Recently, many studies have shown good results in detecting OOR damages using\ndistinct approaches [24–29]. Mishra et al. concluded that a single FBG (Fiber Bragg Grating) sensor, positioned along the rail can detect the presence of wheel flats.\nLourenço et al. created an automatic algorithm for diagnosing OOR defects. The\nproposed methodology consists of isolating specific defective wheels and then identifying the severity of the damage, using only acceleration and strain data measured on\nthe track. In another study, Krummenacher et al. , proposed two machine-learningBy extracting the features, it is possible to transform the measured data into an alternative form of information where the correlation with damage is more easily observed. There are various techniques for feature extraction, the most common being CWT\n(continuous wavelet transform) [31–33], PCA (principal component analysis) ,detection of polygonal wheels on freight vehicles using CWT and ARX features, using\n6 accelerometers, 3 on each side of the railway track. Mosleh et al. introduced aflats by extracting AR features from acceleration records. Moreover, Mohammadi et al.\nadopted linear features, particularly, CWT, PCA, ARX and AR, and their research findingsin the context of wheel flat damage detection. Although these studies have demonstrated robust results in detection, they show some limitations in dealing with the non-linear effects associated with operational effects, such as the train speed. Due to the inability of these linear techniques to attenuate operation effects, the inclusion of different speeds\nFor most of these studies, a feature normalisation stage is used when it is necessary to remove the operational effects. Usually, latent variable methods are used, such as PCA or multiple linear regression (MLR) . Thus, to deal with the non-linear phenomena and reduce the large amounts of data without relying on the aforementioned methods,\nthe first artificial neural networks were created to inherently execute this task . Over the years, new and more advanced networks have been developed, with the Autoencoder\n(AE) being one of the main types. Later, Olshausen et al. proposed the creation of\nsparse coding and Ng et al. introduced a sparse penalisation term in the hidden layer,\nto acquire more compact and effective features from lower-dimensional data.

Thus, before starting the analysis, the\nVSI software imports track irregularities and OOR profiles from a MATLAB file, whichto the vertical and lateral irregularities in each rail in each respective position, and adds it to the constraint equations of the system throughout the dynamics analysis. Then, the\nsystem of dynamic equations is solved using the typical Newmark integration method.\nThe impact of track irregularity on wheel defect classification is significant, as a lower track quality tends to result in a higher likelihood of misclassification. A comprehensive\nexploration of this influence was previously undertaken by Mosleh et al. as documented in their research study . Hence, this study does not delve into the impact of track\nquality; rather, it primarily centres on the utilisation of AI-based methodologies for the detection and classification of wheel defects. For this, four different profiles are used, based\non European Standard EN 13848–2 . In this case, power spectral density (PSD) curvesFor OOR defects, several profiles are defined based on real measurements in representative profiles of the various severities. Subsequently, the structural matrices are imported\nMore details on track and train properties, including additional information on traintrack interaction, can be found in previous publications . Figure 1 shows the\nvehicle–track interaction model schematisation and some details about the train and track\nsubsystems, as well as the track irregularities and wheel-rail contact model.According to the conclusions reached in other studies with this type of damage ,\nthe most promising location of the sensors is on the rail. To reduce installation and maintenance costs, it is important to reduce the number of sensors without compromising the\nquality of the results. Therefore, based on a sensitivity analysis performed during the study,\nonly two vertical unidirectional accelerometers were used on each rail, 4 in total (A1 to A4),\nsince they provided a higher cost–benefit ratio. These sensors are mounted on the rail atdefects, different simulation scenarios with perfect wheels (baseline) and OOR wheels\n(damage) were defined for a five-wagon Laagrss freight train. Based on different crossing speeds, loading schemes and rail irregularities profiles, 120 baseline and 180 damage scenarios (90 for polygonal wheels and 90 for wheel flats) were defined, as summarised in For baseline scenarios, six loading schemes with five different speeds (40, 60, 80, 100\nand 120 km/h) and four rail irregularity profiles were considered, giving a total of 120 scenarios. The loading schemes used are: empty, half-loaded, full-loaded and, additionally,For the damage cases, a total of 90 scenarios were generated for polygonal wheels. These\nscenarios including 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (H1, H2 and H3) x 10 different irregularity profiles within each specified harmonic interval. In these 10 irregularity\nprofiles, based on the defect amplitude, two amplitudes are considered, five simulations for\nA1 and five simulations for A2. Similarly, 90 scenarios were created for wheel flats, involving 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (F1, F2 and F3) x 10 different irregularitywheel radius . This wave phenomenon can be characterised by the different wavelengths formed (harmonics θ ), and by the levels of irregularity ( Lw ) associated with each of the harmonics. According to Peng , it is considered a polygonal wheel when the wear amplitude assumes values above 0. mm and wavelengths between 140 mm and the wheelTo define scenarios with polygonal wheels for the Laagrss wagon, a literature survey on\nexperimental measurements in defective wheels was conducted . Three experimental irregularity profiles were collected, illustrated in Figure 3. The first group (H6-8)\ncorresponds to a study carried out by Cai et al. with dominant harmonics from 6 to 8;**Figure 3.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) of polygonal wheels with**Figure 4.** Examples of polygonal damage profiles for each of the dominant harmonic intervals.the second group (H12-14) to a study authored by Tao et al. with dominant harmonics from 12 to 14; and the third profile (H17-18) to a study performed by Wu et al. with\nBased on the wheel irregularity spectra ( Lw ) taken from the respective measurement profiles, shown in Figure 3, and considering the contribution of the first 30 harmonics, several irregularity profiles were generated, according to Figure 4.

After obtaining the acceleration measurements from the numerical simulations, an FFT algorithm is applied to the time series allowing the conversion of the signal from the time domain to the frequency domain. Then,predefined hyperparameters of the algorithm. The set hyperparameters are encoding and\ndecoding transfer functions, hidden layer size, maximum number of epochs, L2 weight regularisation term, sparsity regularisation term and a sparsity proportion term. Afterwards,**Figure 7.** Flowchart with the main phases of the methodology for detection and classification of OORthe features are extracted in the more compressed layer of the SAE, the so-called bottleneck layer. The number of features obtained is equal to the number of hidden layers which\nis usually considerably lower than the data size, allowing a compression of the input data.\nFurthermore, to enhance the sensitivity to damage, two levels of data fusion are applied to the bottleneck features using the Mahalanobis distance. In the first level, all features are\nfused into a damage index (DI) for each sensor and, in the second level, all the sensors\nare merged resulting in only one DI for each simulation. Finally, automatic damage detection is achieved by performing an outlier analysis, in which a statistical confidence limit\n(CB) is used, based on the Inverse Cumulative Gaussian Distribution Function (ICDF).\nFor feature classification, an automatic clustering process based on the k-means technique is implemented. This algorithm allows for the unsupervised and automatic classification of data, based on the calculation of statistical distances between objects. In k-means technique given a vector of data and chosen k clusters, the key is to find k centroids that minimise\nthe distance of each vector to its nearest centroid . Since it is necessary to define the number of clusters in advance, a global Silhouette index (SIL) was adopted to make\nan automatic process. At the end, the clusters will allow the classification of the two typesbetween the number of correct classifications and the total number of cases.damage detection problems, as it allows a signal to be converted from the time domain to the frequency domain, to capture the excitation frequencies induced by the wheel defects.\nIn addition, a data reduction is carried out at this stage, since the initial records contain aa crossing speed of 80 km/h. When comparing the FFT spectra for a train passage with flats, Figure 8a), with polygonal wheels, Figure 8b), there are visible differences in terms\nof amplitude peak values and excited frequency ranges. For flats, the amplitude peak values are higher and they induce frequencies in the range between DC and 1500accordance with some authors reports . In terms of severities, for flats, the more severe group (55–100 mm) is the one with the higher frequency content, as expected,a baseline response. For polygonal wheels, from the analysis of Figure 8b), it can be seen the frequency peaks for the H12–14 and H17–18 profiles around 100 and 150\nrespectively, while for the profile H6-8 a more flat spectrum is obtained without showing any significant peak. This can be explained by the irregularity level profile of thisThese two graphs can show which frequencies have higher content in the original signal.Autoencoders are artificial neural networks trained using an unsupervised approach,\nwhich aim first to learn coded representations of the data, compressing the input into\na latent space representation, and second, through this compressed information, reconstructing the information. The basic architecture of this type of network consists of threewhere **Wij**, **Wjk** are the weights connection matrices between input layer-hidden\nlayer and hidden layer-output layer, **X** = ( **X** 1, **X** 2, . . ., **Xn** ) is the input data vector,\n**H** = ( **H** 1, . . ., **Hm** ) is the low-dimensional vector and **X** [ˆ] = ( **X** [ˆ] 1, **X** [ˆ] 2, . . ., **X** [ˆ] **n** ) is the output**Figure 8.** Frequency domain responses on position 1 for the crossing speed of 80 km/h: (a) wheel flats,data vector. **b** 1, **b** 2 are bias vectors and σ 1, σ 2 are the activation function used in each of thereconstruction of the input X [ˆ], as shown in Equation (3).

After incorporating various inputs into the SSAE training, they are integrated into the so-called\n‘Input 1’. As training progresses, the data is compressed, and the main characteristics of the signals are obtained and retained in ‘Bottleneck 1’. Subsequently, these characteristics are\nused as input for training the second sparse autoencoder, which, after further compression,\nenables the extraction of the final features. Depending on the type of data under analysis,\nthe compression level differs, so multiple tests should be conducted to optimise these layer sizes. This optimisation was achieved by trial and test, changing both the size of the first\nIt should be noted that this network architecture, where the dimensions of the layers gradually decrease along the network until reaching the bottleneck layer , has proven\nto be highly robust for the type of data used. It allows for effective compression of results**Figure 9.** Schematic of the structure of the SSAE neural network used in this study.After extracting the features from the bottleneck layer of the SSAE, the difference between the healthy wheels scenarios and the damage wheels scenarios is still not sufficient. Hence\na data fusion is performed. With this fusion, it is possible to increase the sensitivity of the\nfeatures, and as a result, to obtain a damage index (DI) for each simulation. Thus, the Mahalanobis distance (MD) is used to reduce the volume of extracted data and preserve the most relevant information . Briefly, MD is a metric that measures the distance between two points in a feature space consisting of two or more variables, being independent of the\nscale of the features, thus allowing an increase in the sensitivity of the features to cases with damage. The MD, denoted here as DI, is calculated for each simulation using the followingin which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−], and ¯ x is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The MD is calculated for each sensor and for each simulation, obtaining a matrix of n distances per k number of sensors.Finally, the discrimination of the features consists in distinguishing the features as corresponding to a healthy or damaged case. At this stage of the methodology, an analysis of\nabnormal values is carried out, which will allow the condition of the train wheels to beautomatically monitored and these values to be classified into different classes. This phaseThe outlier analysis consists of grouping, by probabilistic distribution processes, the datato the previously created group. For this, a statistical confidence limit (CB) is used, based on the inverse cumulative Gaussian distribution function (ICDF), considering the mean\nvalue, ¯ μ, and standard deviation, σ, of the baseline feature vector.Whenever a value of a DI indicator is equal to or greater than CB, it is considered an outlier (the null hypothesis is rejected), thus representing a case of damage.For feature classification, a clustering process is used to divide the dataset into distinct clusters that should be as compact and separated as possible . For clustering, the k-meanson the distances of their vectors. Recent studies showed that the k-means algorithm has shown promising results . The main limitation of this technique is that it requires\nknowledge of the number of clusters in advance. For this purpose, the global silhouetteThis section presents the main results obtained through the application of the methodology proposed in section 3 to the calculated track responses. The methodology is applied using damaged wheel passages for the three simulated train speeds (60, 80 and 100 km/h),hyperparameters (presented in section 3). By adjusting these hyperparameters, it is possible to make the algorithm more efficient and improve the generalisation capabilities, as only\nthe most important features are retained. The optimisation of these hyperparameters isof data under analysis. Based on the principles of the SAE already outlined in other works\nIn the context of this study, the non-linear transfer functions (logsig) proved to be more effective than the linear ones, being the ones used in all the studied cases. After analysing Table 3, there is a similarity in the hyperparameters when comparing the two types of OOR damage. It is observed that the data compression level is the same for both cases, around\n93%, as 500 features are extracted in Bottleneck 2 from the initial input data with 7000\nConcerning the type of damage situation, the size of the ‘Bottleneck 1’ and ‘Bottleneck\n2’ was increased to bring them even closer to the initial amount of input data. This can beanalysis, making it challenging for the autoencoder to define relationships between the data, hence requiring a larger number. On the contrary, the maximum number of epochsIt is also important to emphasise that of the various hyperparameters presented, theOnce the hyperparameters have been defined, all the steps of the methodology are applied to the new dataset. For simplicity, in this section, only the last phase of the methodology will be presented, namely an outlier analysis for damage detection and cluster analysis for damage classification. For each sensor, a matrix n × m is created, where n\nis the number of test passages (baseline scenarios + damage scenarios), and m represents the number of extracted features. So, the size of the matrices is 210 × 2000 in case of the\ntype of damage, 75 × 500 for each amplitude in polygonal wheel, and 120 × 500 for wheelDespite the visual distinction between healthy and damaged wheels based on the data processing presented in subsection 3.2, unsupervised learning must use strategies capable of automatically detecting damage. To this end, an outlier analysis is employed, which consists of defining a confidence threshold using a significance level of 1% , represented**Figure 10.** Automatic OOR damage detection based on outlier analysis.by the green line in Figure 10. This approach makes it possible to successfully detect allTo distinguish the two types of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed. Figure 11\nshows a clear distinction between the damage, even when using a dataset with three different train speeds (60,80 and 100 km/h).. In the case of Figure 11a), using all four\naccelerometers, it is possible to efficiently separate the set into two large clusters, despite\n30 misclassifications (16 in the polygonisation and 14 in the flats). Even so, the accuracy\npercentage is around 85%, which is a very good result. To analyse the sensitivity to the number of sensors, only two sensors were used, one on each side ). The results\nimproved, with a decrease in the number of misclassifications from 30 to 21 (13 for polygonisation and 8 for flats). One explanation could be the disparity in sensor sensitivity to the damage, where some sensors are more sensitive than others due to their spatial positioning in relation to the damage. By merging the data from the less sensitive sensors with the\nmore sensitive ones, this could have a negative impact on the results. Thus, the percentage\nThe purpose behind presenting these two plots was to demonstrate that, whether using 4 sensors or 2 sensors, the classification remains remarkably robust, showing lowAfter identifying the type of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed once again to\nclassify the severity of each damage separately. Regarding polygonal wheels, the classification involves both amplitude and harmonic orders, leading to the clusters depicted in the obtained clusters reasonably reflect the two amplitude groups, with all misclassifications associated with the H6-8 harmonic cases (17 misclassifications). Once the amplitude\nis identified, harmonic classification must be carried out separately for each of the amplitudes. In Figure 12b), related to amplitude A1, it is observed that the obtained clusters**Figure 11.** Automatic OOR damage classification based on cluster analysis using: a) 4 sensors; b) 2are nearly perfect, with only 3 misclassifications. In Figure 12c), there are only 3 misclassifications, totalling 8 misclassifications in the classification of the number of dominant\nThe classification of harmonic order is only possible with the separation of amplitudes,\nFigure 13 presents the clusters obtained for the wheel flat cases. The separation between\nthe less severe group and baseline cases and intermediate (cluster 3) and severe cases (cluster 4) is reduced, resulting in a total of 19 misclassifications. Nevertheless, this result showsrate of about 84%. One possible reason for this significant number of misclassifications could be directly associated with the number of impacts captured by the sensor.In order to contribute to the safety of railway transportation and service quality, an automatic methodology based on machine learning has been proposed. This methodology can accurately detect and classify two types of OOR wheel damage in railway vehicles allowing to mitigate problems at both track and vehicle level, such as derailments or material\ndegradation. It includes a new technique for feature extraction based on a dedicated neural network, the Sparse Autoencoder. This non-linear technique is an upgrade concerning the commonly used linear techniques for feature extraction since it allows a better normalisation of the operational effects in the analysed data, as well as the reduction of large amounts\nof data without relying on other techniques, while keeping the most valuable information. These improvements are achieved through the use of different hyperparameters in**Figure 12.** Automatic classification of polygonal wheels based on cluster analysis: a) amplitude A1-A2;**Figure 13.** Automatic classification of wheel flats based on cluster analysis.the calculations, such as non-linear activation functions and sparsity terms. Consequently,circulation. Particularly in the railway engineering field, the inclusion of this technique\nshowed a good potential to deal with variable train speeds, essentially due to the amplifying effect on the measured track dynamic responses which could induce errors in damage The application of the methodology to the data set proved to be very successful in detecting and classifying the two types of OOR damages. Damage detection was perfect, without\nany false detection. In terms of classifying the type of damage, the results are very good,\nwith a success rate of around 85%, but if only two accelerometers are considered the successrate increases to around 90%. These results are encouraging since the range of speeds considered in the analysis, between 60 and 100 km/h, is the most representative of in-service\nfreight trains. Also, the results show that including the Sparse Autoencoder has a positive\neffect in the normalization of the train speed in the damage data set.\nRegarding the severity classification for each type of damage, the methodology proved equally successful in clustering the different damage severities. For polygonal wheels, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the severity groups in terms of defect amplitude, failing only for the H6-8 harmonic cases, and in terms of harmonic orders for each amplitude,\nwith almost perfect results. For wheel flats, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the three severity groups, though with some misclassifications between the less severe group\nand baseline cases and between intermediate and severe cases. A success rate of around 86%\nis achieved in the classification of polygonal wheel severities and 84% in the classification of wheel flat severities. Even so, these high success rates of over 80% show the robustness\nof this methodology in damage classification regardless of the train speed.on on-site measurements. Additionally, this methodology could be carried out for other types of railway vehicles, for example, passenger vehicles, since the dynamic responses are\ndifferent from freight vehicles. In that case, exploring other recent types of autoencoders,\nTo increase the complexity of the problem, the objective is to explore the concept of\nmultiple damages (same or different OOR types). For this, it will be necessary to incorporate a new stage in the methodology, the damage location stage, which will make it possible\nto distinguish isolated damage from multiple damage, as well as their respective location.\nThus, damage will be identified using cut signals, which will then be used to classify theThis work is a result of project WAY4SafeRail-WAYside monitoring system FOR SAFE RAIL transportation, with reference NORTE-01-0247-FEDER-069595, co-funded by the European Regional\nDevelopment Fund (ERDF), through the North Portugal Regional Operational Programme\nPartnership Agreement.

Within this context,\nan unsupervised methodology based on artificial intelligence techniques is presented, which allows the detection and classification of wheels, based on dynamic responses induced on the track by crossing freight railway vehicles. The methodology involves the following\nsteps: (i) data collection and pre-processing, (ii) feature extraction (iii)\ndata fusion and (iv) feature discrimination. In the first phase, an FFT\nalgorithm is applied to the acceleration track responses. Then, features are extracted after training a Stacked Sparse Autoencoder, in which the main features of the responses are obtained after a compression stage using an encoder network. This lower dimensional\nlayer forces the model to learn a compression of the input data. Then,\nwhich enhances the sensitivity to the damage recognition. Posteriorly, an outlier analysis is performed to distinguish a healthy wheelRail vehicle wheels are subjected to constant wear and tear due to continuous use and inadequate maintenance plans. Over time, this wear and tear can generate more significant defects, so it is extremely important to use sensing to understand when maintenance of both the track and rolling stock is required.

However, this type of system entail high costs envisaging the vehicle wheel condition monitoring, since sensors need to be installed in every vehicle in order to achieve a good representativity . On the other hand, wayside systems are a more viable solution for identifying wheel defects, since the condition of allThe most common wheel defects are known as OOR. As the name infers, this defect is related to deformations on the surface of the wheel circumference that make it not round.\nThis deformation can have many forms and different causes, leading to faults on the vehicle and on the track due to the higher dynamic force values [4–6]. The OOR damagesa function of their shape and size, vehicle characteristics and speed [7–10]. Wheel flats induce high dynamic impact loads on the railway infrastructure, which causes significant damage to both tracks and vehicles, such as broken axles, damaged rolling bearings and cracks in the wheels, rails and sleepers . Moreover, it also generates high vibrations\ntransmitted to the rolling stock, inducing significant stresses and causing damage to the In the case of polygonal wheels, the formation mechanism can be roughly classified\ninto three categories, namely, (1) initial wheel defects , (2) a natural vibration of the\nvehicle–track system and (3) thermoelastic instability . The formation mechanism is strongly contingent on the vehicle type and its operational characteristics, withof dominant harmonic orders [19–22]. For example, Tao et al. studied asymmetrical polygonal wear on metro wheels and obtained harmonic orders of 12–14, while another study by Tao et al. found that the most common harmonic order in Chinese freight trains is 18–19. Although a polygonal wheel could generate less impact on the track than a\nwheel flat, this defect can cause serious damage to the track due to resonance effects in the\nTo identify the occurrence of these OOR anomalies in train wheels, innovative\nmethodologies have been developed combining signal processing and automatic learning techniques. These methodologies are based on the extraction of damage sensitivity features, making possible the distinction between undamaged and damaged situations. Recently, many studies have shown good results in detecting OOR damages using\ndistinct approaches [24–29]. Mishra et al. concluded that a single FBG (Fiber Bragg Grating) sensor, positioned along the rail can detect the presence of wheel flats.\nLourenço et al. created an automatic algorithm for diagnosing OOR defects. The\nproposed methodology consists of isolating specific defective wheels and then identifying the severity of the damage, using only acceleration and strain data measured on\nthe track. In another study, Krummenacher et al. , proposed two machine-learningBy extracting the features, it is possible to transform the measured data into an alternative form of information where the correlation with damage is more easily observed. There are various techniques for feature extraction, the most common being CWT\n(continuous wavelet transform) [31–33], PCA (principal component analysis) ,detection of polygonal wheels on freight vehicles using CWT and ARX features, using\n6 accelerometers, 3 on each side of the railway track. Mosleh et al. introduced aflats by extracting AR features from acceleration records. Moreover, Mohammadi et al.\nadopted linear features, particularly, CWT, PCA, ARX and AR, and their research findingsin the context of wheel flat damage detection. Although these studies have demonstrated robust results in detection, they show some limitations in dealing with the non-linear effects associated with operational effects, such as the train speed. Due to the inability of these linear techniques to attenuate operation effects, the inclusion of different speeds\nFor most of these studies, a feature normalisation stage is used when it is necessary to remove the operational effects. Usually, latent variable methods are used, such as PCA or multiple linear regression (MLR) . Thus, to deal with the non-linear phenomena and reduce the large amounts of data without relying on the aforementioned methods,\nthe first artificial neural networks were created to inherently execute this task . Over the years, new and more advanced networks have been developed, with the Autoencoder\n(AE) being one of the main types. Later, Olshausen et al. proposed the creation of\nsparse coding and Ng et al. introduced a sparse penalisation term in the hidden layer,\nto acquire more compact and effective features from lower-dimensional data. For some datasets with complex relationships between characteristics, employing more than one SAE\nis necessary, which is why stacked sparse autoencoders (SSAE) are commonly used .\nNowadays, these types of AE are widely used in various scientific fields, but specifically\nfor structural engineering only a few studies are found, and most are about damage detection on bridges [45–47].

Pathirage et al. proposed a framework utilizing SAE’s potential for dimensionality reduction, which facilitated the assessment of damage detection performance on Many of these AE algorithms already performed feature classification in order to discriminate the different types of damages and severities. However, the AE methods can also be combined with other techniques commonly used to classify the data. They can be used unsupervised methods, in which the model is trained without any labels provided to the\ntraining dataset, such as k-means , self-organising maps (SOM) , isolation forest, gaussian mixture model , k-medoids and cluster analysis , or supervised\nmethods, which assume that the hierarchy of database categories is known, such as NaiveBayes classifiers , k-Nearest Neighbours classifiers , Support Vector Machinetwo types of OOR damages, flats and polygonal wheels, based on acceleration responses obtained from a virtual wayside monitoring system.

The application of sensors on both sides of theTo obtain the responses from the railway track, it is necessary to apply sensors on the track that can measure the dynamic responses of the crossing trains. As it is not always possible\nto install them due to the high costs involved, simulations have been carried out based on calibrated models of the track , vehicle and considering their dynamic interaction,\nas well as including the track irregularities. Simulations include cases with healthy wheelsTo simulate the dynamic interactions between the vehicle and the track, an in-house software VSI – Vehicle-Structure Interaction Analysis is used, which was initially developed by\nNeves et al. and later improved by Montenegro et al. .

Moreover, it also allows to include the wheel and OOR profiles as a periodic rail irregularity, simplifying the analysis. Thus, before starting the analysis, the\nVSI software imports track irregularities and OOR profiles from a MATLAB file, whichto the vertical and lateral irregularities in each rail in each respective position, and adds it to the constraint equations of the system throughout the dynamics analysis. Then, the\nsystem of dynamic equations is solved using the typical Newmark integration method.\nThe impact of track irregularity on wheel defect classification is significant, as a lower track quality tends to result in a higher likelihood of misclassification. A comprehensive\nexploration of this influence was previously undertaken by Mosleh et al. as documented in their research study . Hence, this study does not delve into the impact of track\nquality; rather, it primarily centres on the utilisation of AI-based methodologies for the detection and classification of wheel defects. For this, four different profiles are used, based\non European Standard EN 13848–2 .

Subsequently, the structural matrices are imported\nMore details on track and train properties, including additional information on traintrack interaction, can be found in previous publications . Figure 1 shows the\nvehicle–track interaction model schematisation and some details about the train and track\nsubsystems, as well as the track irregularities and wheel-rail contact model.According to the conclusions reached in other studies with this type of damage ,\nthe most promising location of the sensors is on the rail. To reduce installation and maintenance costs, it is important to reduce the number of sensors without compromising the\nquality of the results. Therefore, based on a sensitivity analysis performed during the study,\nonly two vertical unidirectional accelerometers were used on each rail, 4 in total (A1 to A4),\nsince they provided a higher cost–benefit ratio. These sensors are mounted on the rail atdefects, different simulation scenarios with perfect wheels (baseline) and OOR wheels\n(damage) were defined for a five-wagon Laagrss freight train. Based on different crossing speeds, loading schemes and rail irregularities profiles, 120 baseline and 180 damage scenarios (90 for polygonal wheels and 90 for wheel flats) were defined, as summarised in For baseline scenarios, six loading schemes with five different speeds (40, 60, 80, 100\nand 120 km/h) and four rail irregularity profiles were considered, giving a total of 120 scenarios. The loading schemes used are: empty, half-loaded, full-loaded and, additionally,For the damage cases, a total of 90 scenarios were generated for polygonal wheels. These\nscenarios including 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (H1, H2 and H3) x 10 different irregularity profiles within each specified harmonic interval. In these 10 irregularity\nprofiles, based on the defect amplitude, two amplitudes are considered, five simulations for\nA1 and five simulations for A2. Similarly, 90 scenarios were created for wheel flats, involving 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (F1, F2 and F3) x 10 different irregularitywheel radius . This wave phenomenon can be characterised by the different wavelengths formed (harmonics θ ), and by the levels of irregularity ( Lw ) associated with each of the harmonics. According to Peng , it is considered a polygonal wheel when the wear amplitude assumes values above 0. mm and wavelengths between 140 mm and the wheelTo define scenarios with polygonal wheels for the Laagrss wagon, a literature survey on\nexperimental measurements in defective wheels was conducted . Three experimental irregularity profiles were collected, illustrated in Figure 3. The first group (H6-8)\ncorresponds to a study carried out by Cai et al. with dominant harmonics from 6 to 8;**Figure 3.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) of polygonal wheels with**Figure 4.** Examples of polygonal damage profiles for each of the dominant harmonic intervals.the second group (H12-14) to a study authored by Tao et al. with dominant harmonics from 12 to 14; and the third profile (H17-18) to a study performed by Wu et al. with\nBased on the wheel irregularity spectra ( Lw ) taken from the respective measurement profiles, shown in Figure 3, and considering the contribution of the first 30 harmonics, several irregularity profiles were generated, according to Figure 4.

Then,predefined hyperparameters of the algorithm. The set hyperparameters are encoding and\ndecoding transfer functions, hidden layer size, maximum number of epochs, L2 weight regularisation term, sparsity regularisation term and a sparsity proportion term. Afterwards,**Figure 7.** Flowchart with the main phases of the methodology for detection and classification of OORthe features are extracted in the more compressed layer of the SAE, the so-called bottleneck layer. The number of features obtained is equal to the number of hidden layers which\nis usually considerably lower than the data size, allowing a compression of the input data.\nFurthermore, to enhance the sensitivity to damage, two levels of data fusion are applied to the bottleneck features using the Mahalanobis distance. In the first level, all features are\nfused into a damage index (DI) for each sensor and, in the second level, all the sensors\nare merged resulting in only one DI for each simulation. Finally, automatic damage detection is achieved by performing an outlier analysis, in which a statistical confidence limit\n(CB) is used, based on the Inverse Cumulative Gaussian Distribution Function (ICDF).\nFor feature classification, an automatic clustering process based on the k-means technique is implemented. This algorithm allows for the unsupervised and automatic classification of data, based on the calculation of statistical distances between objects. In k-means technique given a vector of data and chosen k clusters, the key is to find k centroids that minimise\nthe distance of each vector to its nearest centroid . Since it is necessary to define the number of clusters in advance, a global Silhouette index (SIL) was adopted to make\nan automatic process. At the end, the clusters will allow the classification of the two typesbetween the number of correct classifications and the total number of cases.damage detection problems, as it allows a signal to be converted from the time domain to the frequency domain, to capture the excitation frequencies induced by the wheel defects.\nIn addition, a data reduction is carried out at this stage, since the initial records contain aa crossing speed of 80 km/h. When comparing the FFT spectra for a train passage with flats, Figure 8a), with polygonal wheels, Figure 8b), there are visible differences in terms\nof amplitude peak values and excited frequency ranges. For flats, the amplitude peak values are higher and they induce frequencies in the range between DC and 1500accordance with some authors reports . In terms of severities, for flats, the more severe group (55–100 mm) is the one with the higher frequency content, as expected,a baseline response. For polygonal wheels, from the analysis of Figure 8b), it can be seen the frequency peaks for the H12–14 and H17–18 profiles around 100 and 150\nrespectively, while for the profile H6-8 a more flat spectrum is obtained without showing any significant peak. This can be explained by the irregularity level profile of thisThese two graphs can show which frequencies have higher content in the original signal.Autoencoders are artificial neural networks trained using an unsupervised approach,\nwhich aim first to learn coded representations of the data, compressing the input into\na latent space representation, and second, through this compressed information, reconstructing the information. The basic architecture of this type of network consists of threewhere **Wij**, **Wjk** are the weights connection matrices between input layer-hidden\nlayer and hidden layer-output layer, **X** = ( **X** 1, **X** 2, . . ., **Xn** ) is the input data vector,\n**H** = ( **H** 1, . . ., **Hm** ) is the low-dimensional vector and **X** [ˆ] = ( **X** [ˆ] 1, **X** [ˆ] 2, . . ., **X** [ˆ] **n** ) is the output**Figure 8.** Frequency domain responses on position 1 for the crossing speed of 80 km/h: (a) wheel flats,data vector. **b** 1, **b** 2 are bias vectors and σ 1, σ 2 are the activation function used in each of thereconstruction of the input X [ˆ], as shown in Equation (3).

After incorporating various inputs into the SSAE training, they are integrated into the so-called\n‘Input 1’. As training progresses, the data is compressed, and the main characteristics of the signals are obtained and retained in ‘Bottleneck 1’. Subsequently, these characteristics are\nused as input for training the second sparse autoencoder, which, after further compression,\nenables the extraction of the final features. Depending on the type of data under analysis,\nthe compression level differs, so multiple tests should be conducted to optimise these layer sizes. This optimisation was achieved by trial and test, changing both the size of the first\nIt should be noted that this network architecture, where the dimensions of the layers gradually decrease along the network until reaching the bottleneck layer , has proven\nto be highly robust for the type of data used. It allows for effective compression of results**Figure 9.** Schematic of the structure of the SSAE neural network used in this study.After extracting the features from the bottleneck layer of the SSAE, the difference between the healthy wheels scenarios and the damage wheels scenarios is still not sufficient. Hence\na data fusion is performed. With this fusion, it is possible to increase the sensitivity of the\nfeatures, and as a result, to obtain a damage index (DI) for each simulation. Thus, the Mahalanobis distance (MD) is used to reduce the volume of extracted data and preserve the most relevant information . Briefly, MD is a metric that measures the distance between two points in a feature space consisting of two or more variables, being independent of the\nscale of the features, thus allowing an increase in the sensitivity of the features to cases with damage. The MD, denoted here as DI, is calculated for each simulation using the followingin which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−], and ¯ x is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The MD is calculated for each sensor and for each simulation, obtaining a matrix of n distances per k number of sensors.Finally, the discrimination of the features consists in distinguishing the features as corresponding to a healthy or damaged case. At this stage of the methodology, an analysis of\nabnormal values is carried out, which will allow the condition of the train wheels to beautomatically monitored and these values to be classified into different classes. This phaseThe outlier analysis consists of grouping, by probabilistic distribution processes, the datato the previously created group. For this, a statistical confidence limit (CB) is used, based on the inverse cumulative Gaussian distribution function (ICDF), considering the mean\nvalue, ¯ μ, and standard deviation, σ, of the baseline feature vector.Whenever a value of a DI indicator is equal to or greater than CB, it is considered an outlier (the null hypothesis is rejected), thus representing a case of damage.For feature classification, a clustering process is used to divide the dataset into distinct clusters that should be as compact and separated as possible . For clustering, the k-meanson the distances of their vectors. Recent studies showed that the k-means algorithm has shown promising results . The main limitation of this technique is that it requires\nknowledge of the number of clusters in advance. For this purpose, the global silhouetteThis section presents the main results obtained through the application of the methodology proposed in section 3 to the calculated track responses. The methodology is applied using damaged wheel passages for the three simulated train speeds (60, 80 and 100 km/h),hyperparameters (presented in section 3). By adjusting these hyperparameters, it is possible to make the algorithm more efficient and improve the generalisation capabilities, as only\nthe most important features are retained. The optimisation of these hyperparameters isof data under analysis. Based on the principles of the SAE already outlined in other works\nIn the context of this study, the non-linear transfer functions (logsig) proved to be more effective than the linear ones, being the ones used in all the studied cases. After analysing Table 3, there is a similarity in the hyperparameters when comparing the two types of OOR damage. It is observed that the data compression level is the same for both cases, around\n93%, as 500 features are extracted in Bottleneck 2 from the initial input data with 7000\nConcerning the type of damage situation, the size of the ‘Bottleneck 1’ and ‘Bottleneck\n2’ was increased to bring them even closer to the initial amount of input data. This can beanalysis, making it challenging for the autoencoder to define relationships between the data, hence requiring a larger number. On the contrary, the maximum number of epochsIt is also important to emphasise that of the various hyperparameters presented, theOnce the hyperparameters have been defined, all the steps of the methodology are applied to the new dataset. For simplicity, in this section, only the last phase of the methodology will be presented, namely an outlier analysis for damage detection and cluster analysis for damage classification. For each sensor, a matrix n × m is created, where n\nis the number of test passages (baseline scenarios + damage scenarios), and m represents the number of extracted features. So, the size of the matrices is 210 × 2000 in case of the\ntype of damage, 75 × 500 for each amplitude in polygonal wheel, and 120 × 500 for wheelDespite the visual distinction between healthy and damaged wheels based on the data processing presented in subsection 3.2, unsupervised learning must use strategies capable of automatically detecting damage. To this end, an outlier analysis is employed, which consists of defining a confidence threshold using a significance level of 1% , represented**Figure 10.** Automatic OOR damage detection based on outlier analysis.by the green line in Figure 10. This approach makes it possible to successfully detect allTo distinguish the two types of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed. Figure 11\nshows a clear distinction between the damage, even when using a dataset with three different train speeds (60,80 and 100 km/h).. In the case of Figure 11a), using all four\naccelerometers, it is possible to efficiently separate the set into two large clusters, despite\n30 misclassifications (16 in the polygonisation and 14 in the flats). Even so, the accuracy\npercentage is around 85%, which is a very good result. To analyse the sensitivity to the number of sensors, only two sensors were used, one on each side ). The results\nimproved, with a decrease in the number of misclassifications from 30 to 21 (13 for polygonisation and 8 for flats). One explanation could be the disparity in sensor sensitivity to the damage, where some sensors are more sensitive than others due to their spatial positioning in relation to the damage. By merging the data from the less sensitive sensors with the\nmore sensitive ones, this could have a negative impact on the results. Thus, the percentage\nThe purpose behind presenting these two plots was to demonstrate that, whether using 4 sensors or 2 sensors, the classification remains remarkably robust, showing lowAfter identifying the type of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed once again to\nclassify the severity of each damage separately. Regarding polygonal wheels, the classification involves both amplitude and harmonic orders, leading to the clusters depicted in the obtained clusters reasonably reflect the two amplitude groups, with all misclassifications associated with the H6-8 harmonic cases (17 misclassifications). Once the amplitude\nis identified, harmonic classification must be carried out separately for each of the amplitudes. In Figure 12b), related to amplitude A1, it is observed that the obtained clusters**Figure 11.** Automatic OOR damage classification based on cluster analysis using: a) 4 sensors; b) 2are nearly perfect, with only 3 misclassifications. In Figure 12c), there are only 3 misclassifications, totalling 8 misclassifications in the classification of the number of dominant\nThe classification of harmonic order is only possible with the separation of amplitudes,\nFigure 13 presents the clusters obtained for the wheel flat cases. The separation between\nthe less severe group and baseline cases and intermediate (cluster 3) and severe cases (cluster 4) is reduced, resulting in a total of 19 misclassifications. Nevertheless, this result showsrate of about 84%. One possible reason for this significant number of misclassifications could be directly associated with the number of impacts captured by the sensor.In order to contribute to the safety of railway transportation and service quality, an automatic methodology based on machine learning has been proposed. This methodology can accurately detect and classify two types of OOR wheel damage in railway vehicles allowing to mitigate problems at both track and vehicle level, such as derailments or material\ndegradation. It includes a new technique for feature extraction based on a dedicated neural network, the Sparse Autoencoder. This non-linear technique is an upgrade concerning the commonly used linear techniques for feature extraction since it allows a better normalisation of the operational effects in the analysed data, as well as the reduction of large amounts\nof data without relying on other techniques, while keeping the most valuable information. These improvements are achieved through the use of different hyperparameters in**Figure 12.** Automatic classification of polygonal wheels based on cluster analysis: a) amplitude A1-A2;**Figure 13.** Automatic classification of wheel flats based on cluster analysis.the calculations, such as non-linear activation functions and sparsity terms. Consequently,circulation. Particularly in the railway engineering field, the inclusion of this technique\nshowed a good potential to deal with variable train speeds, essentially due to the amplifying effect on the measured track dynamic responses which could induce errors in damage The application of the methodology to the data set proved to be very successful in detecting and classifying the two types of OOR damages. Damage detection was perfect, without\nany false detection. In terms of classifying the type of damage, the results are very good,\nwith a success rate of around 85%, but if only two accelerometers are considered the successrate increases to around 90%. These results are encouraging since the range of speeds considered in the analysis, between 60 and 100 km/h, is the most representative of in-service\nfreight trains. Also, the results show that including the Sparse Autoencoder has a positive\neffect in the normalization of the train speed in the damage data set.\nRegarding the severity classification for each type of damage, the methodology proved equally successful in clustering the different damage severities. For polygonal wheels, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the severity groups in terms of defect amplitude, failing only for the H6-8 harmonic cases, and in terms of harmonic orders for each amplitude,\nwith almost perfect results. For wheel flats, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the three severity groups, though with some misclassifications between the less severe group\nand baseline cases and between intermediate and severe cases. A success rate of around 86%\nis achieved in the classification of polygonal wheel severities and 84% in the classification of wheel flat severities. Even so, these high success rates of over 80% show the robustness\nof this methodology in damage classification regardless of the train speed.on on-site measurements. Additionally, this methodology could be carried out for other types of railway vehicles, for example, passenger vehicles, since the dynamic responses are\ndifferent from freight vehicles.

Within this context,\nan unsupervised methodology based on artificial intelligence techniques is presented, which allows the detection and classification of wheels, based on dynamic responses induced on the track by crossing freight railway vehicles. The methodology involves the following\nsteps: (i) data collection and pre-processing, (ii) feature extraction (iii)\ndata fusion and (iv) feature discrimination. In the first phase, an FFT\nalgorithm is applied to the acceleration track responses. Then, features are extracted after training a Stacked Sparse Autoencoder, in which the main features of the responses are obtained after a compression stage using an encoder network. This lower dimensional\nlayer forces the model to learn a compression of the input data. Then,\nwhich enhances the sensitivity to the damage recognition. Posteriorly, an outlier analysis is performed to distinguish a healthy wheelRail vehicle wheels are subjected to constant wear and tear due to continuous use and inadequate maintenance plans. Over time, this wear and tear can generate more significant defects, so it is extremely important to use sensing to understand when maintenance of both the track and rolling stock is required.

However, this type of system entail high costs envisaging the vehicle wheel condition monitoring, since sensors need to be installed in every vehicle in order to achieve a good representativity . On the other hand, wayside systems are a more viable solution for identifying wheel defects, since the condition of allThe most common wheel defects are known as OOR. As the name infers, this defect is related to deformations on the surface of the wheel circumference that make it not round.\nThis deformation can have many forms and different causes, leading to faults on the vehicle and on the track due to the higher dynamic force values [4–6]. The OOR damagesa function of their shape and size, vehicle characteristics and speed [7–10]. Wheel flats induce high dynamic impact loads on the railway infrastructure, which causes significant damage to both tracks and vehicles, such as broken axles, damaged rolling bearings and cracks in the wheels, rails and sleepers . Moreover, it also generates high vibrations\ntransmitted to the rolling stock, inducing significant stresses and causing damage to the In the case of polygonal wheels, the formation mechanism can be roughly classified\ninto three categories, namely, (1) initial wheel defects , (2) a natural vibration of the\nvehicle–track system and (3) thermoelastic instability .

These methodologies are based on the extraction of damage sensitivity features, making possible the distinction between undamaged and damaged situations. Recently, many studies have shown good results in detecting OOR damages using\ndistinct approaches [24–29]. Mishra et al. concluded that a single FBG (Fiber Bragg Grating) sensor, positioned along the rail can detect the presence of wheel flats.\nLourenço et al. created an automatic algorithm for diagnosing OOR defects. The\nproposed methodology consists of isolating specific defective wheels and then identifying the severity of the damage, using only acceleration and strain data measured on\nthe track. In another study, Krummenacher et al. , proposed two machine-learningBy extracting the features, it is possible to transform the measured data into an alternative form of information where the correlation with damage is more easily observed. There are various techniques for feature extraction, the most common being CWT\n(continuous wavelet transform) [31–33], PCA (principal component analysis) ,detection of polygonal wheels on freight vehicles using CWT and ARX features, using\n6 accelerometers, 3 on each side of the railway track. Mosleh et al. introduced aflats by extracting AR features from acceleration records. Moreover, Mohammadi et al.\nadopted linear features, particularly, CWT, PCA, ARX and AR, and their research findingsin the context of wheel flat damage detection. Although these studies have demonstrated robust results in detection, they show some limitations in dealing with the non-linear effects associated with operational effects, such as the train speed. Due to the inability of these linear techniques to attenuate operation effects, the inclusion of different speeds\nFor most of these studies, a feature normalisation stage is used when it is necessary to remove the operational effects. Usually, latent variable methods are used, such as PCA or multiple linear regression (MLR) . Thus, to deal with the non-linear phenomena and reduce the large amounts of data without relying on the aforementioned methods,\nthe first artificial neural networks were created to inherently execute this task . Over the years, new and more advanced networks have been developed, with the Autoencoder\n(AE) being one of the main types. Later, Olshausen et al. proposed the creation of\nsparse coding and Ng et al. introduced a sparse penalisation term in the hidden layer,\nto acquire more compact and effective features from lower-dimensional data. For some datasets with complex relationships between characteristics, employing more than one SAE\nis necessary, which is why stacked sparse autoencoders (SSAE) are commonly used .\nNowadays, these types of AE are widely used in various scientific fields, but specifically\nfor structural engineering only a few studies are found, and most are about damage detection on bridges [45–47]. Amaral et al. , proposed an approach for detecting structural anomalies based on SAE and Shewhart’s T control chart. The characteristics extracted byin structures. In another similar study, Amaral et al. , applied the same approach to\na numerical model of a highway viaduct in Brazil reaching more than 99% of successful classifications of structural damage with the combination of SAE and Support Vector Machine. Pathirage et al. proposed a framework utilizing SAE’s potential for dimensionality reduction, which facilitated the assessment of damage detection performance on Many of these AE algorithms already performed feature classification in order to discriminate the different types of damages and severities. However, the AE methods can also be combined with other techniques commonly used to classify the data. They can be used unsupervised methods, in which the model is trained without any labels provided to the\ntraining dataset, such as k-means , self-organising maps (SOM) , isolation forest, gaussian mixture model , k-medoids and cluster analysis , or supervised\nmethods, which assume that the hierarchy of database categories is known, such as NaiveBayes classifiers , k-Nearest Neighbours classifiers , Support Vector Machinetwo types of OOR damages, flats and polygonal wheels, based on acceleration responses obtained from a virtual wayside monitoring system.

The application of sensors on both sides of theTo obtain the responses from the railway track, it is necessary to apply sensors on the track that can measure the dynamic responses of the crossing trains. As it is not always possible\nto install them due to the high costs involved, simulations have been carried out based on calibrated models of the track , vehicle and considering their dynamic interaction,\nas well as including the track irregularities. Simulations include cases with healthy wheelsTo simulate the dynamic interactions between the vehicle and the track, an in-house software VSI – Vehicle-Structure Interaction Analysis is used, which was initially developed by\nNeves et al. and later improved by Montenegro et al. .

For the structural connection of these elements, rigid beam elements are adopted.

Using Lagrange multipliers, this tool connects\nwheel displacements with the track nodal displacements, incorporating track irregularities and OOR profiles through a set of constraint equations. These equations are solved\nalongside equilibrium equations, forming a unified system that couples the two subsystems\n. Including the track irregularities directly in the constraint equations are beneficial since it avoids explicitly considering\nthem in the FEM model. Moreover, it also allows to include the wheel and OOR profiles as a periodic rail irregularity, simplifying the analysis. Thus, before starting the analysis, the\nVSI software imports track irregularities and OOR profiles from a MATLAB file, whichto the vertical and lateral irregularities in each rail in each respective position, and adds it to the constraint equations of the system throughout the dynamics analysis. Then, the\nsystem of dynamic equations is solved using the typical Newmark integration method.\nThe impact of track irregularity on wheel defect classification is significant, as a lower track quality tends to result in a higher likelihood of misclassification. A comprehensive\nexploration of this influence was previously undertaken by Mosleh et al. as documented in their research study . Hence, this study does not delve into the impact of track\nquality; rather, it primarily centres on the utilisation of AI-based methodologies for the detection and classification of wheel defects. For this, four different profiles are used, based\non European Standard EN 13848–2 . In this case, power spectral density (PSD) curvesFor OOR defects, several profiles are defined based on real measurements in representative profiles of the various severities. Subsequently, the structural matrices are imported\nMore details on track and train properties, including additional information on traintrack interaction, can be found in previous publications . Figure 1 shows the\nvehicle–track interaction model schematisation and some details about the train and track\nsubsystems, as well as the track irregularities and wheel-rail contact model.According to the conclusions reached in other studies with this type of damage ,\nthe most promising location of the sensors is on the rail. To reduce installation and maintenance costs, it is important to reduce the number of sensors without compromising the\nquality of the results. Therefore, based on a sensitivity analysis performed during the study,\nonly two vertical unidirectional accelerometers were used on each rail, 4 in total (A1 to A4),\nsince they provided a higher cost–benefit ratio. These sensors are mounted on the rail atdefects, different simulation scenarios with perfect wheels (baseline) and OOR wheels\n(damage) were defined for a five-wagon Laagrss freight train. Based on different crossing speeds, loading schemes and rail irregularities profiles, 120 baseline and 180 damage scenarios (90 for polygonal wheels and 90 for wheel flats) were defined, as summarised in For baseline scenarios, six loading schemes with five different speeds (40, 60, 80, 100\nand 120 km/h) and four rail irregularity profiles were considered, giving a total of 120 scenarios. The loading schemes used are: empty, half-loaded, full-loaded and, additionally,For the damage cases, a total of 90 scenarios were generated for polygonal wheels. These\nscenarios including 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (H1, H2 and H3) x 10 different irregularity profiles within each specified harmonic interval. In these 10 irregularity\nprofiles, based on the defect amplitude, two amplitudes are considered, five simulations for\nA1 and five simulations for A2. Similarly, 90 scenarios were created for wheel flats, involving 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (F1, F2 and F3) x 10 different irregularitywheel radius . This wave phenomenon can be characterised by the different wavelengths formed (harmonics θ ), and by the levels of irregularity ( Lw ) associated with each of the harmonics. According to Peng , it is considered a polygonal wheel when the wear amplitude assumes values above 0. mm and wavelengths between 140 mm and the wheelTo define scenarios with polygonal wheels for the Laagrss wagon, a literature survey on\nexperimental measurements in defective wheels was conducted . Three experimental irregularity profiles were collected, illustrated in Figure 3. The first group (H6-8)\ncorresponds to a study carried out by Cai et al. with dominant harmonics from 6 to 8;**Figure 3.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) of polygonal wheels with**Figure 4.** Examples of polygonal damage profiles for each of the dominant harmonic intervals.the second group (H12-14) to a study authored by Tao et al. with dominant harmonics from 12 to 14; and the third profile (H17-18) to a study performed by Wu et al. with\nBased on the wheel irregularity spectra ( Lw ) taken from the respective measurement profiles, shown in Figure 3, and considering the contribution of the first 30 harmonics, several irregularity profiles were generated, according to Figure 4.

A less severe group, with a 10–20 mm length, an intermediate group, with a 25–50 mm length and a more severe case, with a 55–100 mm length. The irregularity profiles are generated randomly, but in this case, in function of two geometric\nvariables, the length and the depth of the flat. More details about the process of generation of flat profiles can be found in the study performed by Mosleh et al .

The sampling frequency for data acquisition is considered 10 kHz in order to ensure a good problem Figure 6a) shows two baseline cases for two speeds (40 and 100 km/h), where it is possible to observe the influence of speed on the dynamic response. The amplifying effect\nof speed can influence the identification of damage, which is why a robust baseline with a wide range of scenarios is very important. At a speed of 40 km/h, lower accelerations\naround 0. m/s⊃2 are observed. In contrast, at a speed of 100 km/h (considerably higher),\naccelerations increase substantially to around 3. m/s⊃2. This illustrates the significant**Figure 6.** Acceleration time-series in sensor A1 for Laagrss vehicle: (a) influence of speed, (b) influencehigher speeds.

After obtaining the acceleration measurements from the numerical simulations, an FFT algorithm is applied to the time series allowing the conversion of the signal from the time domain to the frequency domain. Then,predefined hyperparameters of the algorithm. The set hyperparameters are encoding and\ndecoding transfer functions, hidden layer size, maximum number of epochs, L2 weight regularisation term, sparsity regularisation term and a sparsity proportion term. Afterwards,**Figure 7.** Flowchart with the main phases of the methodology for detection and classification of OORthe features are extracted in the more compressed layer of the SAE, the so-called bottleneck layer. The number of features obtained is equal to the number of hidden layers which\nis usually considerably lower than the data size, allowing a compression of the input data.\nFurthermore, to enhance the sensitivity to damage, two levels of data fusion are applied to the bottleneck features using the Mahalanobis distance. In the first level, all features are\nfused into a damage index (DI) for each sensor and, in the second level, all the sensors\nare merged resulting in only one DI for each simulation. Finally, automatic damage detection is achieved by performing an outlier analysis, in which a statistical confidence limit\n(CB) is used, based on the Inverse Cumulative Gaussian Distribution Function (ICDF).\nFor feature classification, an automatic clustering process based on the k-means technique is implemented. This algorithm allows for the unsupervised and automatic classification of data, based on the calculation of statistical distances between objects. In k-means technique given a vector of data and chosen k clusters, the key is to find k centroids that minimise\nthe distance of each vector to its nearest centroid . Since it is necessary to define the number of clusters in advance, a global Silhouette index (SIL) was adopted to make\nan automatic process. At the end, the clusters will allow the classification of the two typesbetween the number of correct classifications and the total number of cases.damage detection problems, as it allows a signal to be converted from the time domain to the frequency domain, to capture the excitation frequencies induced by the wheel defects.\nIn addition, a data reduction is carried out at this stage, since the initial records contain aa crossing speed of 80 km/h. When comparing the FFT spectra for a train passage with flats, Figure 8a), with polygonal wheels, Figure 8b), there are visible differences in terms\nof amplitude peak values and excited frequency ranges. For flats, the amplitude peak values are higher and they induce frequencies in the range between DC and 1500accordance with some authors reports . In terms of severities, for flats, the more severe group (55–100 mm) is the one with the higher frequency content, as expected,a baseline response. For polygonal wheels, from the analysis of Figure 8b), it can be seen the frequency peaks for the H12–14 and H17–18 profiles around 100 and 150\nrespectively, while for the profile H6-8 a more flat spectrum is obtained without showing any significant peak. This can be explained by the irregularity level profile of thisThese two graphs can show which frequencies have higher content in the original signal.Autoencoders are artificial neural networks trained using an unsupervised approach,\nwhich aim first to learn coded representations of the data, compressing the input into\na latent space representation, and second, through this compressed information, reconstructing the information.

After incorporating various inputs into the SSAE training, they are integrated into the so-called\n‘Input 1’. As training progresses, the data is compressed, and the main characteristics of the signals are obtained and retained in ‘Bottleneck 1’. Subsequently, these characteristics are\nused as input for training the second sparse autoencoder, which, after further compression,\nenables the extraction of the final features. Depending on the type of data under analysis,\nthe compression level differs, so multiple tests should be conducted to optimise these layer sizes. This optimisation was achieved by trial and test, changing both the size of the first\nIt should be noted that this network architecture, where the dimensions of the layers gradually decrease along the network until reaching the bottleneck layer , has proven\nto be highly robust for the type of data used. It allows for effective compression of results**Figure 9.** Schematic of the structure of the SSAE neural network used in this study.After extracting the features from the bottleneck layer of the SSAE, the difference between the healthy wheels scenarios and the damage wheels scenarios is still not sufficient. Hence\na data fusion is performed. With this fusion, it is possible to increase the sensitivity of the\nfeatures, and as a result, to obtain a damage index (DI) for each simulation. Thus, the Mahalanobis distance (MD) is used to reduce the volume of extracted data and preserve the most relevant information . Briefly, MD is a metric that measures the distance between two points in a feature space consisting of two or more variables, being independent of the\nscale of the features, thus allowing an increase in the sensitivity of the features to cases with damage. The MD, denoted here as DI, is calculated for each simulation using the followingin which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−], and ¯ x is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The MD is calculated for each sensor and for each simulation, obtaining a matrix of n distances per k number of sensors.Finally, the discrimination of the features consists in distinguishing the features as corresponding to a healthy or damaged case. At this stage of the methodology, an analysis of\nabnormal values is carried out, which will allow the condition of the train wheels to beautomatically monitored and these values to be classified into different classes. This phaseThe outlier analysis consists of grouping, by probabilistic distribution processes, the datato the previously created group. For this, a statistical confidence limit (CB) is used, based on the inverse cumulative Gaussian distribution function (ICDF), considering the mean\nvalue, ¯ μ, and standard deviation, σ, of the baseline feature vector.Whenever a value of a DI indicator is equal to or greater than CB, it is considered an outlier (the null hypothesis is rejected), thus representing a case of damage.For feature classification, a clustering process is used to divide the dataset into distinct clusters that should be as compact and separated as possible . For clustering, the k-meanson the distances of their vectors. Recent studies showed that the k-means algorithm has shown promising results . The main limitation of this technique is that it requires\nknowledge of the number of clusters in advance. For this purpose, the global silhouetteThis section presents the main results obtained through the application of the methodology proposed in section 3 to the calculated track responses. The methodology is applied using damaged wheel passages for the three simulated train speeds (60, 80 and 100 km/h),hyperparameters (presented in section 3). By adjusting these hyperparameters, it is possible to make the algorithm more efficient and improve the generalisation capabilities, as only\nthe most important features are retained. The optimisation of these hyperparameters isof data under analysis. Based on the principles of the SAE already outlined in other works\nIn the context of this study, the non-linear transfer functions (logsig) proved to be more effective than the linear ones, being the ones used in all the studied cases. After analysing Table 3, there is a similarity in the hyperparameters when comparing the two types of OOR damage. It is observed that the data compression level is the same for both cases, around\n93%, as 500 features are extracted in Bottleneck 2 from the initial input data with 7000\nConcerning the type of damage situation, the size of the ‘Bottleneck 1’ and ‘Bottleneck\n2’ was increased to bring them even closer to the initial amount of input data. This can beanalysis, making it challenging for the autoencoder to define relationships between the data, hence requiring a larger number. On the contrary, the maximum number of epochsIt is also important to emphasise that of the various hyperparameters presented, theOnce the hyperparameters have been defined, all the steps of the methodology are applied to the new dataset. For simplicity, in this section, only the last phase of the methodology will be presented, namely an outlier analysis for damage detection and cluster analysis for damage classification. For each sensor, a matrix n × m is created, where n\nis the number of test passages (baseline scenarios + damage scenarios), and m represents the number of extracted features. So, the size of the matrices is 210 × 2000 in case of the\ntype of damage, 75 × 500 for each amplitude in polygonal wheel, and 120 × 500 for wheelDespite the visual distinction between healthy and damaged wheels based on the data processing presented in subsection 3.2, unsupervised learning must use strategies capable of automatically detecting damage. To this end, an outlier analysis is employed, which consists of defining a confidence threshold using a significance level of 1% , represented**Figure 10.** Automatic OOR damage detection based on outlier analysis.by the green line in Figure 10. This approach makes it possible to successfully detect allTo distinguish the two types of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed. Figure 11\nshows a clear distinction between the damage, even when using a dataset with three different train speeds (60,80 and 100 km/h).. In the case of Figure 11a), using all four\naccelerometers, it is possible to efficiently separate the set into two large clusters, despite\n30 misclassifications (16 in the polygonisation and 14 in the flats). Even so, the accuracy\npercentage is around 85%, which is a very good result. To analyse the sensitivity to the number of sensors, only two sensors were used, one on each side ). The results\nimproved, with a decrease in the number of misclassifications from 30 to 21 (13 for polygonisation and 8 for flats). One explanation could be the disparity in sensor sensitivity to the damage, where some sensors are more sensitive than others due to their spatial positioning in relation to the damage. By merging the data from the less sensitive sensors with the\nmore sensitive ones, this could have a negative impact on the results. Thus, the percentage\nThe purpose behind presenting these two plots was to demonstrate that, whether using 4 sensors or 2 sensors, the classification remains remarkably robust, showing lowAfter identifying the type of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed once again to\nclassify the severity of each damage separately. Regarding polygonal wheels, the classification involves both amplitude and harmonic orders, leading to the clusters depicted in the obtained clusters reasonably reflect the two amplitude groups, with all misclassifications associated with the H6-8 harmonic cases (17 misclassifications). Once the amplitude\nis identified, harmonic classification must be carried out separately for each of the amplitudes. In Figure 12b), related to amplitude A1, it is observed that the obtained clusters**Figure 11.** Automatic OOR damage classification based on cluster analysis using: a) 4 sensors; b) 2are nearly perfect, with only 3 misclassifications. In Figure 12c), there are only 3 misclassifications, totalling 8 misclassifications in the classification of the number of dominant\nThe classification of harmonic order is only possible with the separation of amplitudes,\nFigure 13 presents the clusters obtained for the wheel flat cases. The separation between\nthe less severe group and baseline cases and intermediate (cluster 3) and severe cases (cluster 4) is reduced, resulting in a total of 19 misclassifications. Nevertheless, this result showsrate of about 84%. One possible reason for this significant number of misclassifications could be directly associated with the number of impacts captured by the sensor.In order to contribute to the safety of railway transportation and service quality, an automatic methodology based on machine learning has been proposed. This methodology can accurately detect and classify two types of OOR wheel damage in railway vehicles allowing to mitigate problems at both track and vehicle level, such as derailments or material\ndegradation. It includes a new technique for feature extraction based on a dedicated neural network, the Sparse Autoencoder. This non-linear technique is an upgrade concerning the commonly used linear techniques for feature extraction since it allows a better normalisation of the operational effects in the analysed data, as well as the reduction of large amounts\nof data without relying on other techniques, while keeping the most valuable information. These improvements are achieved through the use of different hyperparameters in**Figure 12.** Automatic classification of polygonal wheels based on cluster analysis: a) amplitude A1-A2;**Figure 13.** Automatic classification of wheel flats based on cluster analysis.the calculations, such as non-linear activation functions and sparsity terms. Consequently,circulation. Particularly in the railway engineering field, the inclusion of this technique\nshowed a good potential to deal with variable train speeds, essentially due to the amplifying effect on the measured track dynamic responses which could induce errors in damage The application of the methodology to the data set proved to be very successful in detecting and classifying the two types of OOR damages. Damage detection was perfect, without\nany false detection. In terms of classifying the type of damage, the results are very good,\nwith a success rate of around 85%, but if only two accelerometers are considered the successrate increases to around 90%. These results are encouraging since the range of speeds considered in the analysis, between 60 and 100 km/h, is the most representative of in-service\nfreight trains. Also, the results show that including the Sparse Autoencoder has a positive\neffect in the normalization of the train speed in the damage data set.\nRegarding the severity classification for each type of damage, the methodology proved equally successful in clustering the different damage severities. For polygonal wheels, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the severity groups in terms of defect amplitude, failing only for the H6-8 harmonic cases, and in terms of harmonic orders for each amplitude,\nwith almost perfect results. For wheel flats, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the three severity groups, though with some misclassifications between the less severe group\nand baseline cases and between intermediate and severe cases. A success rate of around 86%\nis achieved in the classification of polygonal wheel severities and 84% in the classification of wheel flat severities. Even so, these high success rates of over 80% show the robustness\nof this methodology in damage classification regardless of the train speed.on on-site measurements. Additionally, this methodology could be carried out for other types of railway vehicles, for example, passenger vehicles, since the dynamic responses are\ndifferent from freight vehicles. In that case, exploring other recent types of autoencoders,\nTo increase the complexity of the problem, the objective is to explore the concept of\nmultiple damages (same or different OOR types). For this, it will be necessary to incorporate a new stage in the methodology, the damage location stage, which will make it possible\nto distinguish isolated damage from multiple damage, as well as their respective location.\nThus, damage will be identified using cut signals, which will then be used to classify theThis work is a result of project WAY4SafeRail-WAYside monitoring system FOR SAFE RAIL transportation, with reference NORTE-01-0247-FEDER-069595, co-funded by the European Regional\nDevelopment Fund (ERDF), through the North Portugal Regional Operational Programme\nPartnership Agreement.

However, this type of system entail high costs envisaging the vehicle wheel condition monitoring, since sensors need to be installed in every vehicle in order to achieve a good representativity . On the other hand, wayside systems are a more viable solution for identifying wheel defects, since the condition of allThe most common wheel defects are known as OOR. As the name infers, this defect is related to deformations on the surface of the wheel circumference that make it not round.\nThis deformation can have many forms and different causes, leading to faults on the vehicle and on the track due to the higher dynamic force values [4–6]. The OOR damagesa function of their shape and size, vehicle characteristics and speed [7–10]. Wheel flats induce high dynamic impact loads on the railway infrastructure, which causes significant damage to both tracks and vehicles, such as broken axles, damaged rolling bearings and cracks in the wheels, rails and sleepers . Moreover, it also generates high vibrations\ntransmitted to the rolling stock, inducing significant stresses and causing damage to the In the case of polygonal wheels, the formation mechanism can be roughly classified\ninto three categories, namely, (1) initial wheel defects , (2) a natural vibration of the\nvehicle–track system and (3) thermoelastic instability . The formation mechanism is strongly contingent on the vehicle type and its operational characteristics, withof dominant harmonic orders [19–22]. For example, Tao et al. studied asymmetrical polygonal wear on metro wheels and obtained harmonic orders of 12–14, while another study by Tao et al. found that the most common harmonic order in Chinese freight trains is 18–19.

Moreover, Mohammadi et al.\nadopted linear features, particularly, CWT, PCA, ARX and AR, and their research findingsin the context of wheel flat damage detection. Although these studies have demonstrated robust results in detection, they show some limitations in dealing with the non-linear effects associated with operational effects, such as the train speed. Due to the inability of these linear techniques to attenuate operation effects, the inclusion of different speeds\nFor most of these studies, a feature normalisation stage is used when it is necessary to remove the operational effects. Usually, latent variable methods are used, such as PCA or multiple linear regression (MLR) . Thus, to deal with the non-linear phenomena and reduce the large amounts of data without relying on the aforementioned methods,\nthe first artificial neural networks were created to inherently execute this task . Over the years, new and more advanced networks have been developed, with the Autoencoder\n(AE) being one of the main types.

Then, the\nsystem of dynamic equations is solved using the typical Newmark integration method.\nThe impact of track irregularity on wheel defect classification is significant, as a lower track quality tends to result in a higher likelihood of misclassification. A comprehensive\nexploration of this influence was previously undertaken by Mosleh et al. as documented in their research study . Hence, this study does not delve into the impact of track\nquality; rather, it primarily centres on the utilisation of AI-based methodologies for the detection and classification of wheel defects. For this, four different profiles are used, based\non European Standard EN 13848–2 .

Based on different crossing speeds, loading schemes and rail irregularities profiles, 120 baseline and 180 damage scenarios (90 for polygonal wheels and 90 for wheel flats) were defined, as summarised in For baseline scenarios, six loading schemes with five different speeds (40, 60, 80, 100\nand 120 km/h) and four rail irregularity profiles were considered, giving a total of 120 scenarios. The loading schemes used are: empty, half-loaded, full-loaded and, additionally,For the damage cases, a total of 90 scenarios were generated for polygonal wheels.

In these 10 irregularity\nprofiles, based on the defect amplitude, two amplitudes are considered, five simulations for\nA1 and five simulations for A2. Similarly, 90 scenarios were created for wheel flats, involving 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (F1, F2 and F3) x 10 different irregularitywheel radius . This wave phenomenon can be characterised by the different wavelengths formed (harmonics θ ), and by the levels of irregularity ( Lw ) associated with each of the harmonics. According to Peng , it is considered a polygonal wheel when the wear amplitude assumes values above 0. mm and wavelengths between 140 mm and the wheelTo define scenarios with polygonal wheels for the Laagrss wagon, a literature survey on\nexperimental measurements in defective wheels was conducted . Three experimental irregularity profiles were collected, illustrated in Figure 3. The first group (H6-8)\ncorresponds to a study carried out by Cai et al. with dominant harmonics from 6 to 8;**Figure 3.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) of polygonal wheels with**Figure 4.** Examples of polygonal damage profiles for each of the dominant harmonic intervals.the second group (H12-14) to a study authored by Tao et al. with dominant harmonics from 12 to 14; and the third profile (H17-18) to a study performed by Wu et al. with\nBased on the wheel irregularity spectra ( Lw ) taken from the respective measurement profiles, shown in Figure 3, and considering the contribution of the first 30 harmonics, several irregularity profiles were generated, according to Figure 4.

After obtaining the acceleration measurements from the numerical simulations, an FFT algorithm is applied to the time series allowing the conversion of the signal from the time domain to the frequency domain. Then,predefined hyperparameters of the algorithm. The set hyperparameters are encoding and\ndecoding transfer functions, hidden layer size, maximum number of epochs, L2 weight regularisation term, sparsity regularisation term and a sparsity proportion term. Afterwards,**Figure 7.** Flowchart with the main phases of the methodology for detection and classification of OORthe features are extracted in the more compressed layer of the SAE, the so-called bottleneck layer. The number of features obtained is equal to the number of hidden layers which\nis usually considerably lower than the data size, allowing a compression of the input data.\nFurthermore, to enhance the sensitivity to damage, two levels of data fusion are applied to the bottleneck features using the Mahalanobis distance. In the first level, all features are\nfused into a damage index (DI) for each sensor and, in the second level, all the sensors\nare merged resulting in only one DI for each simulation. Finally, automatic damage detection is achieved by performing an outlier analysis, in which a statistical confidence limit\n(CB) is used, based on the Inverse Cumulative Gaussian Distribution Function (ICDF).\nFor feature classification, an automatic clustering process based on the k-means technique is implemented. This algorithm allows for the unsupervised and automatic classification of data, based on the calculation of statistical distances between objects. In k-means technique given a vector of data and chosen k clusters, the key is to find k centroids that minimise\nthe distance of each vector to its nearest centroid . Since it is necessary to define the number of clusters in advance, a global Silhouette index (SIL) was adopted to make\nan automatic process. At the end, the clusters will allow the classification of the two typesbetween the number of correct classifications and the total number of cases.damage detection problems, as it allows a signal to be converted from the time domain to the frequency domain, to capture the excitation frequencies induced by the wheel defects.\nIn addition, a data reduction is carried out at this stage, since the initial records contain aa crossing speed of 80 km/h. When comparing the FFT spectra for a train passage with flats, Figure 8a), with polygonal wheels, Figure 8b), there are visible differences in terms\nof amplitude peak values and excited frequency ranges. For flats, the amplitude peak values are higher and they induce frequencies in the range between DC and 1500accordance with some authors reports . In terms of severities, for flats, the more severe group (55–100 mm) is the one with the higher frequency content, as expected,a baseline response. For polygonal wheels, from the analysis of Figure 8b), it can be seen the frequency peaks for the H12–14 and H17–18 profiles around 100 and 150\nrespectively, while for the profile H6-8 a more flat spectrum is obtained without showing any significant peak. This can be explained by the irregularity level profile of thisThese two graphs can show which frequencies have higher content in the original signal.Autoencoders are artificial neural networks trained using an unsupervised approach,\nwhich aim first to learn coded representations of the data, compressing the input into\na latent space representation, and second, through this compressed information, reconstructing the information. The basic architecture of this type of network consists of threewhere **Wij**, **Wjk** are the weights connection matrices between input layer-hidden\nlayer and hidden layer-output layer, **X** = ( **X** 1, **X** 2, . . ., **Xn** ) is the input data vector,\n**H** = ( **H** 1, . . ., **Hm** ) is the low-dimensional vector and **X** [ˆ] = ( **X** [ˆ] 1, **X** [ˆ] 2, . . ., **X** [ˆ] **n** ) is the output**Figure 8.** Frequency domain responses on position 1 for the crossing speed of 80 km/h: (a) wheel flats,data vector. **b** 1, **b** 2 are bias vectors and σ 1, σ 2 are the activation function used in each of thereconstruction of the input X [ˆ], as shown in Equation (3).

After incorporating various inputs into the SSAE training, they are integrated into the so-called\n‘Input 1’. As training progresses, the data is compressed, and the main characteristics of the signals are obtained and retained in ‘Bottleneck 1’. Subsequently, these characteristics are\nused as input for training the second sparse autoencoder, which, after further compression,\nenables the extraction of the final features. Depending on the type of data under analysis,\nthe compression level differs, so multiple tests should be conducted to optimise these layer sizes. This optimisation was achieved by trial and test, changing both the size of the first\nIt should be noted that this network architecture, where the dimensions of the layers gradually decrease along the network until reaching the bottleneck layer , has proven\nto be highly robust for the type of data used. It allows for effective compression of results**Figure 9.** Schematic of the structure of the SSAE neural network used in this study.After extracting the features from the bottleneck layer of the SSAE, the difference between the healthy wheels scenarios and the damage wheels scenarios is still not sufficient. Hence\na data fusion is performed. With this fusion, it is possible to increase the sensitivity of the\nfeatures, and as a result, to obtain a damage index (DI) for each simulation. Thus, the Mahalanobis distance (MD) is used to reduce the volume of extracted data and preserve the most relevant information . Briefly, MD is a metric that measures the distance between two points in a feature space consisting of two or more variables, being independent of the\nscale of the features, thus allowing an increase in the sensitivity of the features to cases with damage. The MD, denoted here as DI, is calculated for each simulation using the followingin which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−], and ¯ x is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The MD is calculated for each sensor and for each simulation, obtaining a matrix of n distances per k number of sensors.Finally, the discrimination of the features consists in distinguishing the features as corresponding to a healthy or damaged case. At this stage of the methodology, an analysis of\nabnormal values is carried out, which will allow the condition of the train wheels to beautomatically monitored and these values to be classified into different classes. This phaseThe outlier analysis consists of grouping, by probabilistic distribution processes, the datato the previously created group. For this, a statistical confidence limit (CB) is used, based on the inverse cumulative Gaussian distribution function (ICDF), considering the mean\nvalue, ¯ μ, and standard deviation, σ, of the baseline feature vector.Whenever a value of a DI indicator is equal to or greater than CB, it is considered an outlier (the null hypothesis is rejected), thus representing a case of damage.For feature classification, a clustering process is used to divide the dataset into distinct clusters that should be as compact and separated as possible . For clustering, the k-meanson the distances of their vectors. Recent studies showed that the k-means algorithm has shown promising results . The main limitation of this technique is that it requires\nknowledge of the number of clusters in advance. For this purpose, the global silhouetteThis section presents the main results obtained through the application of the methodology proposed in section 3 to the calculated track responses. The methodology is applied using damaged wheel passages for the three simulated train speeds (60, 80 and 100 km/h),hyperparameters (presented in section 3). By adjusting these hyperparameters, it is possible to make the algorithm more efficient and improve the generalisation capabilities, as only\nthe most important features are retained. The optimisation of these hyperparameters isof data under analysis. Based on the principles of the SAE already outlined in other works\nIn the context of this study, the non-linear transfer functions (logsig) proved to be more effective than the linear ones, being the ones used in all the studied cases. After analysing Table 3, there is a similarity in the hyperparameters when comparing the two types of OOR damage. It is observed that the data compression level is the same for both cases, around\n93%, as 500 features are extracted in Bottleneck 2 from the initial input data with 7000\nConcerning the type of damage situation, the size of the ‘Bottleneck 1’ and ‘Bottleneck\n2’ was increased to bring them even closer to the initial amount of input data. This can beanalysis, making it challenging for the autoencoder to define relationships between the data, hence requiring a larger number. On the contrary, the maximum number of epochsIt is also important to emphasise that of the various hyperparameters presented, theOnce the hyperparameters have been defined, all the steps of the methodology are applied to the new dataset. For simplicity, in this section, only the last phase of the methodology will be presented, namely an outlier analysis for damage detection and cluster analysis for damage classification. For each sensor, a matrix n × m is created, where n\nis the number of test passages (baseline scenarios + damage scenarios), and m represents the number of extracted features. So, the size of the matrices is 210 × 2000 in case of the\ntype of damage, 75 × 500 for each amplitude in polygonal wheel, and 120 × 500 for wheelDespite the visual distinction between healthy and damaged wheels based on the data processing presented in subsection 3.2, unsupervised learning must use strategies capable of automatically detecting damage. To this end, an outlier analysis is employed, which consists of defining a confidence threshold using a significance level of 1% , represented**Figure 10.** Automatic OOR damage detection based on outlier analysis.by the green line in Figure 10. This approach makes it possible to successfully detect allTo distinguish the two types of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed. Figure 11\nshows a clear distinction between the damage, even when using a dataset with three different train speeds (60,80 and 100 km/h).. In the case of Figure 11a), using all four\naccelerometers, it is possible to efficiently separate the set into two large clusters, despite\n30 misclassifications (16 in the polygonisation and 14 in the flats). Even so, the accuracy\npercentage is around 85%, which is a very good result. To analyse the sensitivity to the number of sensors, only two sensors were used, one on each side ). The results\nimproved, with a decrease in the number of misclassifications from 30 to 21 (13 for polygonisation and 8 for flats). One explanation could be the disparity in sensor sensitivity to the damage, where some sensors are more sensitive than others due to their spatial positioning in relation to the damage. By merging the data from the less sensitive sensors with the\nmore sensitive ones, this could have a negative impact on the results. Thus, the percentage\nThe purpose behind presenting these two plots was to demonstrate that, whether using 4 sensors or 2 sensors, the classification remains remarkably robust, showing lowAfter identifying the type of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed once again to\nclassify the severity of each damage separately. Regarding polygonal wheels, the classification involves both amplitude and harmonic orders, leading to the clusters depicted in the obtained clusters reasonably reflect the two amplitude groups, with all misclassifications associated with the H6-8 harmonic cases (17 misclassifications). Once the amplitude\nis identified, harmonic classification must be carried out separately for each of the amplitudes. In Figure 12b), related to amplitude A1, it is observed that the obtained clusters**Figure 11.** Automatic OOR damage classification based on cluster analysis using: a) 4 sensors; b) 2are nearly perfect, with only 3 misclassifications. In Figure 12c), there are only 3 misclassifications, totalling 8 misclassifications in the classification of the number of dominant\nThe classification of harmonic order is only possible with the separation of amplitudes,\nFigure 13 presents the clusters obtained for the wheel flat cases. The separation between\nthe less severe group and baseline cases and intermediate (cluster 3) and severe cases (cluster 4) is reduced, resulting in a total of 19 misclassifications. Nevertheless, this result showsrate of about 84%. One possible reason for this significant number of misclassifications could be directly associated with the number of impacts captured by the sensor.In order to contribute to the safety of railway transportation and service quality, an automatic methodology based on machine learning has been proposed. This methodology can accurately detect and classify two types of OOR wheel damage in railway vehicles allowing to mitigate problems at both track and vehicle level, such as derailments or material\ndegradation. It includes a new technique for feature extraction based on a dedicated neural network, the Sparse Autoencoder. This non-linear technique is an upgrade concerning the commonly used linear techniques for feature extraction since it allows a better normalisation of the operational effects in the analysed data, as well as the reduction of large amounts\nof data without relying on other techniques, while keeping the most valuable information. These improvements are achieved through the use of different hyperparameters in**Figure 12.** Automatic classification of polygonal wheels based on cluster analysis: a) amplitude A1-A2;**Figure 13.** Automatic classification of wheel flats based on cluster analysis.the calculations, such as non-linear activation functions and sparsity terms. Consequently,circulation. Particularly in the railway engineering field, the inclusion of this technique\nshowed a good potential to deal with variable train speeds, essentially due to the amplifying effect on the measured track dynamic responses which could induce errors in damage The application of the methodology to the data set proved to be very successful in detecting and classifying the two types of OOR damages. Damage detection was perfect, without\nany false detection. In terms of classifying the type of damage, the results are very good,\nwith a success rate of around 85%, but if only two accelerometers are considered the successrate increases to around 90%. These results are encouraging since the range of speeds considered in the analysis, between 60 and 100 km/h, is the most representative of in-service\nfreight trains. Also, the results show that including the Sparse Autoencoder has a positive\neffect in the normalization of the train speed in the damage data set.\nRegarding the severity classification for each type of damage, the methodology proved equally successful in clustering the different damage severities. For polygonal wheels, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the severity groups in terms of defect amplitude, failing only for the H6-8 harmonic cases, and in terms of harmonic orders for each amplitude,\nwith almost perfect results. For wheel flats, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the three severity groups, though with some misclassifications between the less severe group\nand baseline cases and between intermediate and severe cases. A success rate of around 86%\nis achieved in the classification of polygonal wheel severities and 84% in the classification of wheel flat severities. Even so, these high success rates of over 80% show the robustness\nof this methodology in damage classification regardless of the train speed.on on-site measurements. Additionally, this methodology could be carried out for other types of railway vehicles, for example, passenger vehicles, since the dynamic responses are\ndifferent from freight vehicles. In that case, exploring other recent types of autoencoders,\nTo increase the complexity of the problem, the objective is to explore the concept of\nmultiple damages (same or different OOR types). For this, it will be necessary to incorporate a new stage in the methodology, the damage location stage, which will make it possible\nto distinguish isolated damage from multiple damage, as well as their respective location.\nThus, damage will be identified using cut signals, which will then be used to classify theThis work is a result of project WAY4SafeRail-WAYside monitoring system FOR SAFE RAIL transportation, with reference NORTE-01-0247-FEDER-069595, co-funded by the European Regional\nDevelopment Fund (ERDF), through the North Portugal Regional Operational Programme\nPartnership Agreement.

However, this type of system entail high costs envisaging the vehicle wheel condition monitoring, since sensors need to be installed in every vehicle in order to achieve a good representativity . On the other hand, wayside systems are a more viable solution for identifying wheel defects, since the condition of allThe most common wheel defects are known as OOR. As the name infers, this defect is related to deformations on the surface of the wheel circumference that make it not round.\nThis deformation can have many forms and different causes, leading to faults on the vehicle and on the track due to the higher dynamic force values [4–6]. The OOR damagesa function of their shape and size, vehicle characteristics and speed [7–10]. Wheel flats induce high dynamic impact loads on the railway infrastructure, which causes significant damage to both tracks and vehicles, such as broken axles, damaged rolling bearings and cracks in the wheels, rails and sleepers . Moreover, it also generates high vibrations\ntransmitted to the rolling stock, inducing significant stresses and causing damage to the In the case of polygonal wheels, the formation mechanism can be roughly classified\ninto three categories, namely, (1) initial wheel defects , (2) a natural vibration of the\nvehicle–track system and (3) thermoelastic instability . The formation mechanism is strongly contingent on the vehicle type and its operational characteristics, withof dominant harmonic orders [19–22]. For example, Tao et al. studied asymmetrical polygonal wear on metro wheels and obtained harmonic orders of 12–14, while another study by Tao et al. found that the most common harmonic order in Chinese freight trains is 18–19. Although a polygonal wheel could generate less impact on the track than a\nwheel flat, this defect can cause serious damage to the track due to resonance effects in the\nTo identify the occurrence of these OOR anomalies in train wheels, innovative\nmethodologies have been developed combining signal processing and automatic learning techniques. These methodologies are based on the extraction of damage sensitivity features, making possible the distinction between undamaged and damaged situations. Recently, many studies have shown good results in detecting OOR damages using\ndistinct approaches [24–29]. Mishra et al. concluded that a single FBG (Fiber Bragg Grating) sensor, positioned along the rail can detect the presence of wheel flats.\nLourenço et al. created an automatic algorithm for diagnosing OOR defects. The\nproposed methodology consists of isolating specific defective wheels and then identifying the severity of the damage, using only acceleration and strain data measured on\nthe track. In another study, Krummenacher et al. , proposed two machine-learningBy extracting the features, it is possible to transform the measured data into an alternative form of information where the correlation with damage is more easily observed. There are various techniques for feature extraction, the most common being CWT\n(continuous wavelet transform) [31–33], PCA (principal component analysis) ,detection of polygonal wheels on freight vehicles using CWT and ARX features, using\n6 accelerometers, 3 on each side of the railway track. Mosleh et al. introduced aflats by extracting AR features from acceleration records. Moreover, Mohammadi et al.\nadopted linear features, particularly, CWT, PCA, ARX and AR, and their research findingsin the context of wheel flat damage detection. Although these studies have demonstrated robust results in detection, they show some limitations in dealing with the non-linear effects associated with operational effects, such as the train speed. Due to the inability of these linear techniques to attenuate operation effects, the inclusion of different speeds\nFor most of these studies, a feature normalisation stage is used when it is necessary to remove the operational effects. Usually, latent variable methods are used, such as PCA or multiple linear regression (MLR) . Thus, to deal with the non-linear phenomena and reduce the large amounts of data without relying on the aforementioned methods,\nthe first artificial neural networks were created to inherently execute this task . Over the years, new and more advanced networks have been developed, with the Autoencoder\n(AE) being one of the main types. Later, Olshausen et al. proposed the creation of\nsparse coding and Ng et al. introduced a sparse penalisation term in the hidden layer,\nto acquire more compact and effective features from lower-dimensional data. For some datasets with complex relationships between characteristics, employing more than one SAE\nis necessary, which is why stacked sparse autoencoders (SSAE) are commonly used .\nNowadays, these types of AE are widely used in various scientific fields, but specifically\nfor structural engineering only a few studies are found, and most are about damage detection on bridges [45–47].

Pathirage et al. proposed a framework utilizing SAE’s potential for dimensionality reduction, which facilitated the assessment of damage detection performance on Many of these AE algorithms already performed feature classification in order to discriminate the different types of damages and severities. However, the AE methods can also be combined with other techniques commonly used to classify the data. They can be used unsupervised methods, in which the model is trained without any labels provided to the\ntraining dataset, such as k-means , self-organising maps (SOM) , isolation forest, gaussian mixture model , k-medoids and cluster analysis , or supervised\nmethods, which assume that the hierarchy of database categories is known, such as NaiveBayes classifiers , k-Nearest Neighbours classifiers , Support Vector Machinetwo types of OOR damages, flats and polygonal wheels, based on acceleration responses obtained from a virtual wayside monitoring system.

The application of sensors on both sides of theTo obtain the responses from the railway track, it is necessary to apply sensors on the track that can measure the dynamic responses of the crossing trains. As it is not always possible\nto install them due to the high costs involved, simulations have been carried out based on calibrated models of the track , vehicle and considering their dynamic interaction,\nas well as including the track irregularities. Simulations include cases with healthy wheelsTo simulate the dynamic interactions between the vehicle and the track, an in-house software VSI – Vehicle-Structure Interaction Analysis is used, which was initially developed by\nNeves et al. and later improved by Montenegro et al. .

Including the track irregularities directly in the constraint equations are beneficial since it avoids explicitly considering\nthem in the FEM model. Moreover, it also allows to include the wheel and OOR profiles as a periodic rail irregularity, simplifying the analysis. Thus, before starting the analysis, the\nVSI software imports track irregularities and OOR profiles from a MATLAB file, whichto the vertical and lateral irregularities in each rail in each respective position, and adds it to the constraint equations of the system throughout the dynamics analysis. Then, the\nsystem of dynamic equations is solved using the typical Newmark integration method.\nThe impact of track irregularity on wheel defect classification is significant, as a lower track quality tends to result in a higher likelihood of misclassification. A comprehensive\nexploration of this influence was previously undertaken by Mosleh et al. as documented in their research study . Hence, this study does not delve into the impact of track\nquality; rather, it primarily centres on the utilisation of AI-based methodologies for the detection and classification of wheel defects. For this, four different profiles are used, based\non European Standard EN 13848–2 .

Subsequently, the structural matrices are imported\nMore details on track and train properties, including additional information on traintrack interaction, can be found in previous publications . Figure 1 shows the\nvehicle–track interaction model schematisation and some details about the train and track\nsubsystems, as well as the track irregularities and wheel-rail contact model.According to the conclusions reached in other studies with this type of damage ,\nthe most promising location of the sensors is on the rail. To reduce installation and maintenance costs, it is important to reduce the number of sensors without compromising the\nquality of the results. Therefore, based on a sensitivity analysis performed during the study,\nonly two vertical unidirectional accelerometers were used on each rail, 4 in total (A1 to A4),\nsince they provided a higher cost–benefit ratio. These sensors are mounted on the rail atdefects, different simulation scenarios with perfect wheels (baseline) and OOR wheels\n(damage) were defined for a five-wagon Laagrss freight train. Based on different crossing speeds, loading schemes and rail irregularities profiles, 120 baseline and 180 damage scenarios (90 for polygonal wheels and 90 for wheel flats) were defined, as summarised in For baseline scenarios, six loading schemes with five different speeds (40, 60, 80, 100\nand 120 km/h) and four rail irregularity profiles were considered, giving a total of 120 scenarios. The loading schemes used are: empty, half-loaded, full-loaded and, additionally,For the damage cases, a total of 90 scenarios were generated for polygonal wheels. These\nscenarios including 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (H1, H2 and H3) x 10 different irregularity profiles within each specified harmonic interval. In these 10 irregularity\nprofiles, based on the defect amplitude, two amplitudes are considered, five simulations for\nA1 and five simulations for A2. Similarly, 90 scenarios were created for wheel flats, involving 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (F1, F2 and F3) x 10 different irregularitywheel radius . This wave phenomenon can be characterised by the different wavelengths formed (harmonics θ ), and by the levels of irregularity ( Lw ) associated with each of the harmonics. According to Peng , it is considered a polygonal wheel when the wear amplitude assumes values above 0. mm and wavelengths between 140 mm and the wheelTo define scenarios with polygonal wheels for the Laagrss wagon, a literature survey on\nexperimental measurements in defective wheels was conducted . Three experimental irregularity profiles were collected, illustrated in Figure 3. The first group (H6-8)\ncorresponds to a study carried out by Cai et al. with dominant harmonics from 6 to 8;**Figure 3.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) of polygonal wheels with**Figure 4.** Examples of polygonal damage profiles for each of the dominant harmonic intervals.the second group (H12-14) to a study authored by Tao et al. with dominant harmonics from 12 to 14; and the third profile (H17-18) to a study performed by Wu et al. with\nBased on the wheel irregularity spectra ( Lw ) taken from the respective measurement profiles, shown in Figure 3, and considering the contribution of the first 30 harmonics, several irregularity profiles were generated, according to Figure 4.

Then,predefined hyperparameters of the algorithm. The set hyperparameters are encoding and\ndecoding transfer functions, hidden layer size, maximum number of epochs, L2 weight regularisation term, sparsity regularisation term and a sparsity proportion term. Afterwards,**Figure 7.** Flowchart with the main phases of the methodology for detection and classification of OORthe features are extracted in the more compressed layer of the SAE, the so-called bottleneck layer. The number of features obtained is equal to the number of hidden layers which\nis usually considerably lower than the data size, allowing a compression of the input data.\nFurthermore, to enhance the sensitivity to damage, two levels of data fusion are applied to the bottleneck features using the Mahalanobis distance. In the first level, all features are\nfused into a damage index (DI) for each sensor and, in the second level, all the sensors\nare merged resulting in only one DI for each simulation. Finally, automatic damage detection is achieved by performing an outlier analysis, in which a statistical confidence limit\n(CB) is used, based on the Inverse Cumulative Gaussian Distribution Function (ICDF).\nFor feature classification, an automatic clustering process based on the k-means technique is implemented. This algorithm allows for the unsupervised and automatic classification of data, based on the calculation of statistical distances between objects. In k-means technique given a vector of data and chosen k clusters, the key is to find k centroids that minimise\nthe distance of each vector to its nearest centroid . Since it is necessary to define the number of clusters in advance, a global Silhouette index (SIL) was adopted to make\nan automatic process. At the end, the clusters will allow the classification of the two typesbetween the number of correct classifications and the total number of cases.damage detection problems, as it allows a signal to be converted from the time domain to the frequency domain, to capture the excitation frequencies induced by the wheel defects.\nIn addition, a data reduction is carried out at this stage, since the initial records contain aa crossing speed of 80 km/h. When comparing the FFT spectra for a train passage with flats, Figure 8a), with polygonal wheels, Figure 8b), there are visible differences in terms\nof amplitude peak values and excited frequency ranges. For flats, the amplitude peak values are higher and they induce frequencies in the range between DC and 1500accordance with some authors reports . In terms of severities, for flats, the more severe group (55–100 mm) is the one with the higher frequency content, as expected,a baseline response. For polygonal wheels, from the analysis of Figure 8b), it can be seen the frequency peaks for the H12–14 and H17–18 profiles around 100 and 150\nrespectively, while for the profile H6-8 a more flat spectrum is obtained without showing any significant peak. This can be explained by the irregularity level profile of thisThese two graphs can show which frequencies have higher content in the original signal.Autoencoders are artificial neural networks trained using an unsupervised approach,\nwhich aim first to learn coded representations of the data, compressing the input into\na latent space representation, and second, through this compressed information, reconstructing the information. The basic architecture of this type of network consists of threewhere **Wij**, **Wjk** are the weights connection matrices between input layer-hidden\nlayer and hidden layer-output layer, **X** = ( **X** 1, **X** 2, . . ., **Xn** ) is the input data vector,\n**H** = ( **H** 1, . . ., **Hm** ) is the low-dimensional vector and **X** [ˆ] = ( **X** [ˆ] 1, **X** [ˆ] 2, . . ., **X** [ˆ] **n** ) is the output**Figure 8.** Frequency domain responses on position 1 for the crossing speed of 80 km/h: (a) wheel flats,data vector. **b** 1, **b** 2 are bias vectors and σ 1, σ 2 are the activation function used in each of thereconstruction of the input X [ˆ], as shown in Equation (3).

After incorporating various inputs into the SSAE training, they are integrated into the so-called\n‘Input 1’. As training progresses, the data is compressed, and the main characteristics of the signals are obtained and retained in ‘Bottleneck 1’. Subsequently, these characteristics are\nused as input for training the second sparse autoencoder, which, after further compression,\nenables the extraction of the final features. Depending on the type of data under analysis,\nthe compression level differs, so multiple tests should be conducted to optimise these layer sizes. This optimisation was achieved by trial and test, changing both the size of the first\nIt should be noted that this network architecture, where the dimensions of the layers gradually decrease along the network until reaching the bottleneck layer , has proven\nto be highly robust for the type of data used. It allows for effective compression of results**Figure 9.** Schematic of the structure of the SSAE neural network used in this study.After extracting the features from the bottleneck layer of the SSAE, the difference between the healthy wheels scenarios and the damage wheels scenarios is still not sufficient. Hence\na data fusion is performed. With this fusion, it is possible to increase the sensitivity of the\nfeatures, and as a result, to obtain a damage index (DI) for each simulation. Thus, the Mahalanobis distance (MD) is used to reduce the volume of extracted data and preserve the most relevant information . Briefly, MD is a metric that measures the distance between two points in a feature space consisting of two or more variables, being independent of the\nscale of the features, thus allowing an increase in the sensitivity of the features to cases with damage. The MD, denoted here as DI, is calculated for each simulation using the followingin which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−], and ¯ x is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The MD is calculated for each sensor and for each simulation, obtaining a matrix of n distances per k number of sensors.Finally, the discrimination of the features consists in distinguishing the features as corresponding to a healthy or damaged case. At this stage of the methodology, an analysis of\nabnormal values is carried out, which will allow the condition of the train wheels to beautomatically monitored and these values to be classified into different classes. This phaseThe outlier analysis consists of grouping, by probabilistic distribution processes, the datato the previously created group. For this, a statistical confidence limit (CB) is used, based on the inverse cumulative Gaussian distribution function (ICDF), considering the mean\nvalue, ¯ μ, and standard deviation, σ, of the baseline feature vector.Whenever a value of a DI indicator is equal to or greater than CB, it is considered an outlier (the null hypothesis is rejected), thus representing a case of damage.For feature classification, a clustering process is used to divide the dataset into distinct clusters that should be as compact and separated as possible . For clustering, the k-meanson the distances of their vectors. Recent studies showed that the k-means algorithm has shown promising results . The main limitation of this technique is that it requires\nknowledge of the number of clusters in advance. For this purpose, the global silhouetteThis section presents the main results obtained through the application of the methodology proposed in section 3 to the calculated track responses. The methodology is applied using damaged wheel passages for the three simulated train speeds (60, 80 and 100 km/h),hyperparameters (presented in section 3). By adjusting these hyperparameters, it is possible to make the algorithm more efficient and improve the generalisation capabilities, as only\nthe most important features are retained. The optimisation of these hyperparameters isof data under analysis. Based on the principles of the SAE already outlined in other works\nIn the context of this study, the non-linear transfer functions (logsig) proved to be more effective than the linear ones, being the ones used in all the studied cases. After analysing Table 3, there is a similarity in the hyperparameters when comparing the two types of OOR damage. It is observed that the data compression level is the same for both cases, around\n93%, as 500 features are extracted in Bottleneck 2 from the initial input data with 7000\nConcerning the type of damage situation, the size of the ‘Bottleneck 1’ and ‘Bottleneck\n2’ was increased to bring them even closer to the initial amount of input data. This can beanalysis, making it challenging for the autoencoder to define relationships between the data, hence requiring a larger number. On the contrary, the maximum number of epochsIt is also important to emphasise that of the various hyperparameters presented, theOnce the hyperparameters have been defined, all the steps of the methodology are applied to the new dataset. For simplicity, in this section, only the last phase of the methodology will be presented, namely an outlier analysis for damage detection and cluster analysis for damage classification. For each sensor, a matrix n × m is created, where n\nis the number of test passages (baseline scenarios + damage scenarios), and m represents the number of extracted features. So, the size of the matrices is 210 × 2000 in case of the\ntype of damage, 75 × 500 for each amplitude in polygonal wheel, and 120 × 500 for wheelDespite the visual distinction between healthy and damaged wheels based on the data processing presented in subsection 3.2, unsupervised learning must use strategies capable of automatically detecting damage. To this end, an outlier analysis is employed, which consists of defining a confidence threshold using a significance level of 1% , represented**Figure 10.** Automatic OOR damage detection based on outlier analysis.by the green line in Figure 10. This approach makes it possible to successfully detect allTo distinguish the two types of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed. Figure 11\nshows a clear distinction between the damage, even when using a dataset with three different train speeds (60,80 and 100 km/h).. In the case of Figure 11a), using all four\naccelerometers, it is possible to efficiently separate the set into two large clusters, despite\n30 misclassifications (16 in the polygonisation and 14 in the flats). Even so, the accuracy\npercentage is around 85%, which is a very good result. To analyse the sensitivity to the number of sensors, only two sensors were used, one on each side ). The results\nimproved, with a decrease in the number of misclassifications from 30 to 21 (13 for polygonisation and 8 for flats). One explanation could be the disparity in sensor sensitivity to the damage, where some sensors are more sensitive than others due to their spatial positioning in relation to the damage. By merging the data from the less sensitive sensors with the\nmore sensitive ones, this could have a negative impact on the results. Thus, the percentage\nThe purpose behind presenting these two plots was to demonstrate that, whether using 4 sensors or 2 sensors, the classification remains remarkably robust, showing lowAfter identifying the type of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed once again to\nclassify the severity of each damage separately. Regarding polygonal wheels, the classification involves both amplitude and harmonic orders, leading to the clusters depicted in the obtained clusters reasonably reflect the two amplitude groups, with all misclassifications associated with the H6-8 harmonic cases (17 misclassifications). Once the amplitude\nis identified, harmonic classification must be carried out separately for each of the amplitudes. In Figure 12b), related to amplitude A1, it is observed that the obtained clusters**Figure 11.** Automatic OOR damage classification based on cluster analysis using: a) 4 sensors; b) 2are nearly perfect, with only 3 misclassifications. In Figure 12c), there are only 3 misclassifications, totalling 8 misclassifications in the classification of the number of dominant\nThe classification of harmonic order is only possible with the separation of amplitudes,\nFigure 13 presents the clusters obtained for the wheel flat cases. The separation between\nthe less severe group and baseline cases and intermediate (cluster 3) and severe cases (cluster 4) is reduced, resulting in a total of 19 misclassifications. Nevertheless, this result showsrate of about 84%. One possible reason for this significant number of misclassifications could be directly associated with the number of impacts captured by the sensor.In order to contribute to the safety of railway transportation and service quality, an automatic methodology based on machine learning has been proposed. This methodology can accurately detect and classify two types of OOR wheel damage in railway vehicles allowing to mitigate problems at both track and vehicle level, such as derailments or material\ndegradation. It includes a new technique for feature extraction based on a dedicated neural network, the Sparse Autoencoder. This non-linear technique is an upgrade concerning the commonly used linear techniques for feature extraction since it allows a better normalisation of the operational effects in the analysed data, as well as the reduction of large amounts\nof data without relying on other techniques, while keeping the most valuable information. These improvements are achieved through the use of different hyperparameters in**Figure 12.** Automatic classification of polygonal wheels based on cluster analysis: a) amplitude A1-A2;**Figure 13.** Automatic classification of wheel flats based on cluster analysis.the calculations, such as non-linear activation functions and sparsity terms. Consequently,circulation. Particularly in the railway engineering field, the inclusion of this technique\nshowed a good potential to deal with variable train speeds, essentially due to the amplifying effect on the measured track dynamic responses which could induce errors in damage The application of the methodology to the data set proved to be very successful in detecting and classifying the two types of OOR damages. Damage detection was perfect, without\nany false detection. In terms of classifying the type of damage, the results are very good,\nwith a success rate of around 85%, but if only two accelerometers are considered the successrate increases to around 90%. These results are encouraging since the range of speeds considered in the analysis, between 60 and 100 km/h, is the most representative of in-service\nfreight trains. Also, the results show that including the Sparse Autoencoder has a positive\neffect in the normalization of the train speed in the damage data set.\nRegarding the severity classification for each type of damage, the methodology proved equally successful in clustering the different damage severities. For polygonal wheels, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the severity groups in terms of defect amplitude, failing only for the H6-8 harmonic cases, and in terms of harmonic orders for each amplitude,\nwith almost perfect results. For wheel flats, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the three severity groups, though with some misclassifications between the less severe group\nand baseline cases and between intermediate and severe cases. A success rate of around 86%\nis achieved in the classification of polygonal wheel severities and 84% in the classification of wheel flat severities. Even so, these high success rates of over 80% show the robustness\nof this methodology in damage classification regardless of the train speed.on on-site measurements. Additionally, this methodology could be carried out for other types of railway vehicles, for example, passenger vehicles, since the dynamic responses are\ndifferent from freight vehicles. In that case, exploring other recent types of autoencoders,\nTo increase the complexity of the problem, the objective is to explore the concept of\nmultiple damages (same or different OOR types). For this, it will be necessary to incorporate a new stage in the methodology, the damage location stage, which will make it possible\nto distinguish isolated damage from multiple damage, as well as their respective location.\nThus, damage will be identified using cut signals, which will then be used to classify theThis work is a result of project WAY4SafeRail-WAYside monitoring system FOR SAFE RAIL transportation, with reference NORTE-01-0247-FEDER-069595, co-funded by the European Regional\nDevelopment Fund (ERDF), through the North Portugal Regional Operational Programme\nPartnership Agreement.

Within this context,\nan unsupervised methodology based on artificial intelligence techniques is presented, which allows the detection and classification of wheels, based on dynamic responses induced on the track by crossing freight railway vehicles. The methodology involves the following\nsteps: (i) data collection and pre-processing, (ii) feature extraction (iii)\ndata fusion and (iv) feature discrimination. In the first phase, an FFT\nalgorithm is applied to the acceleration track responses. Then, features are extracted after training a Stacked Sparse Autoencoder, in which the main features of the responses are obtained after a compression stage using an encoder network. This lower dimensional\nlayer forces the model to learn a compression of the input data. Then,\nwhich enhances the sensitivity to the damage recognition. Posteriorly, an outlier analysis is performed to distinguish a healthy wheelRail vehicle wheels are subjected to constant wear and tear due to continuous use and inadequate maintenance plans. Over time, this wear and tear can generate more significant defects, so it is extremely important to use sensing to understand when maintenance of both the track and rolling stock is required.

However, this type of system entail high costs envisaging the vehicle wheel condition monitoring, since sensors need to be installed in every vehicle in order to achieve a good representativity . On the other hand, wayside systems are a more viable solution for identifying wheel defects, since the condition of allThe most common wheel defects are known as OOR. As the name infers, this defect is related to deformations on the surface of the wheel circumference that make it not round.\nThis deformation can have many forms and different causes, leading to faults on the vehicle and on the track due to the higher dynamic force values [4–6]. The OOR damagesa function of their shape and size, vehicle characteristics and speed [7–10]. Wheel flats induce high dynamic impact loads on the railway infrastructure, which causes significant damage to both tracks and vehicles, such as broken axles, damaged rolling bearings and cracks in the wheels, rails and sleepers . Moreover, it also generates high vibrations\ntransmitted to the rolling stock, inducing significant stresses and causing damage to the In the case of polygonal wheels, the formation mechanism can be roughly classified\ninto three categories, namely, (1) initial wheel defects , (2) a natural vibration of the\nvehicle–track system and (3) thermoelastic instability . The formation mechanism is strongly contingent on the vehicle type and its operational characteristics, withof dominant harmonic orders [19–22]. For example, Tao et al. studied asymmetrical polygonal wear on metro wheels and obtained harmonic orders of 12–14, while another study by Tao et al. found that the most common harmonic order in Chinese freight trains is 18–19. Although a polygonal wheel could generate less impact on the track than a\nwheel flat, this defect can cause serious damage to the track due to resonance effects in the\nTo identify the occurrence of these OOR anomalies in train wheels, innovative\nmethodologies have been developed combining signal processing and automatic learning techniques. These methodologies are based on the extraction of damage sensitivity features, making possible the distinction between undamaged and damaged situations. Recently, many studies have shown good results in detecting OOR damages using\ndistinct approaches [24–29]. Mishra et al. concluded that a single FBG (Fiber Bragg Grating) sensor, positioned along the rail can detect the presence of wheel flats.\nLourenço et al. created an automatic algorithm for diagnosing OOR defects. The\nproposed methodology consists of isolating specific defective wheels and then identifying the severity of the damage, using only acceleration and strain data measured on\nthe track. In another study, Krummenacher et al. , proposed two machine-learningBy extracting the features, it is possible to transform the measured data into an alternative form of information where the correlation with damage is more easily observed. There are various techniques for feature extraction, the most common being CWT\n(continuous wavelet transform) [31–33], PCA (principal component analysis) ,detection of polygonal wheels on freight vehicles using CWT and ARX features, using\n6 accelerometers, 3 on each side of the railway track. Mosleh et al. introduced aflats by extracting AR features from acceleration records. Moreover, Mohammadi et al.\nadopted linear features, particularly, CWT, PCA, ARX and AR, and their research findingsin the context of wheel flat damage detection. Although these studies have demonstrated robust results in detection, they show some limitations in dealing with the non-linear effects associated with operational effects, such as the train speed. Due to the inability of these linear techniques to attenuate operation effects, the inclusion of different speeds\nFor most of these studies, a feature normalisation stage is used when it is necessary to remove the operational effects. Usually, latent variable methods are used, such as PCA or multiple linear regression (MLR) . Thus, to deal with the non-linear phenomena and reduce the large amounts of data without relying on the aforementioned methods,\nthe first artificial neural networks were created to inherently execute this task .

Pathirage et al. proposed a framework utilizing SAE’s potential for dimensionality reduction, which facilitated the assessment of damage detection performance on Many of these AE algorithms already performed feature classification in order to discriminate the different types of damages and severities. However, the AE methods can also be combined with other techniques commonly used to classify the data.

The application of sensors on both sides of theTo obtain the responses from the railway track, it is necessary to apply sensors on the track that can measure the dynamic responses of the crossing trains. As it is not always possible\nto install them due to the high costs involved, simulations have been carried out based on calibrated models of the track , vehicle and considering their dynamic interaction,\nas well as including the track irregularities. Simulations include cases with healthy wheelsTo simulate the dynamic interactions between the vehicle and the track, an in-house software VSI – Vehicle-Structure Interaction Analysis is used, which was initially developed by\nNeves et al. and later improved by Montenegro et al. .

For the structural connection of these elements, rigid beam elements are adopted. Table 1 outlines the properties of the The Hertzian theory is applied to calculate the normal contact forces, while the USETABthe train to the track in the VSI software. Using Lagrange multipliers, this tool connects\nwheel displacements with the track nodal displacements, incorporating track irregularities and OOR profiles through a set of constraint equations. These equations are solved\nalongside equilibrium equations, forming a unified system that couples the two subsystems\n. Including the track irregularities directly in the constraint equations are beneficial since it avoids explicitly considering\nthem in the FEM model. Moreover, it also allows to include the wheel and OOR profiles as a periodic rail irregularity, simplifying the analysis. Thus, before starting the analysis, the\nVSI software imports track irregularities and OOR profiles from a MATLAB file, whichto the vertical and lateral irregularities in each rail in each respective position, and adds it to the constraint equations of the system throughout the dynamics analysis. Then, the\nsystem of dynamic equations is solved using the typical Newmark integration method.\nThe impact of track irregularity on wheel defect classification is significant, as a lower track quality tends to result in a higher likelihood of misclassification. A comprehensive\nexploration of this influence was previously undertaken by Mosleh et al. as documented in their research study . Hence, this study does not delve into the impact of track\nquality; rather, it primarily centres on the utilisation of AI-based methodologies for the detection and classification of wheel defects. For this, four different profiles are used, based\non European Standard EN 13848–2 . In this case, power spectral density (PSD) curvesFor OOR defects, several profiles are defined based on real measurements in representative profiles of the various severities. Subsequently, the structural matrices are imported\nMore details on track and train properties, including additional information on traintrack interaction, can be found in previous publications . Figure 1 shows the\nvehicle–track interaction model schematisation and some details about the train and track\nsubsystems, as well as the track irregularities and wheel-rail contact model.According to the conclusions reached in other studies with this type of damage ,\nthe most promising location of the sensors is on the rail. To reduce installation and maintenance costs, it is important to reduce the number of sensors without compromising the\nquality of the results. Therefore, based on a sensitivity analysis performed during the study,\nonly two vertical unidirectional accelerometers were used on each rail, 4 in total (A1 to A4),\nsince they provided a higher cost–benefit ratio. These sensors are mounted on the rail atdefects, different simulation scenarios with perfect wheels (baseline) and OOR wheels\n(damage) were defined for a five-wagon Laagrss freight train. Based on different crossing speeds, loading schemes and rail irregularities profiles, 120 baseline and 180 damage scenarios (90 for polygonal wheels and 90 for wheel flats) were defined, as summarised in For baseline scenarios, six loading schemes with five different speeds (40, 60, 80, 100\nand 120 km/h) and four rail irregularity profiles were considered, giving a total of 120 scenarios. The loading schemes used are: empty, half-loaded, full-loaded and, additionally,For the damage cases, a total of 90 scenarios were generated for polygonal wheels. These\nscenarios including 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (H1, H2 and H3) x 10 different irregularity profiles within each specified harmonic interval. In these 10 irregularity\nprofiles, based on the defect amplitude, two amplitudes are considered, five simulations for\nA1 and five simulations for A2. Similarly, 90 scenarios were created for wheel flats, involving 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (F1, F2 and F3) x 10 different irregularitywheel radius . This wave phenomenon can be characterised by the different wavelengths formed (harmonics θ ), and by the levels of irregularity ( Lw ) associated with each of the harmonics. According to Peng , it is considered a polygonal wheel when the wear amplitude assumes values above 0. mm and wavelengths between 140 mm and the wheelTo define scenarios with polygonal wheels for the Laagrss wagon, a literature survey on\nexperimental measurements in defective wheels was conducted . Three experimental irregularity profiles were collected, illustrated in Figure 3. The first group (H6-8)\ncorresponds to a study carried out by Cai et al. with dominant harmonics from 6 to 8;**Figure 3.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) of polygonal wheels with**Figure 4.** Examples of polygonal damage profiles for each of the dominant harmonic intervals.the second group (H12-14) to a study authored by Tao et al. with dominant harmonics from 12 to 14; and the third profile (H17-18) to a study performed by Wu et al. with\nBased on the wheel irregularity spectra ( Lw ) taken from the respective measurement profiles, shown in Figure 3, and considering the contribution of the first 30 harmonics, several irregularity profiles were generated, according to Figure 4.

A less severe group, with a 10–20 mm length, an intermediate group, with a 25–50 mm length and a more severe case, with a 55–100 mm length. The irregularity profiles are generated randomly, but in this case, in function of two geometric\nvariables, the length and the depth of the flat. More details about the process of generation of flat profiles can be found in the study performed by Mosleh et al .

The sampling frequency for data acquisition is considered 10 kHz in order to ensure a good problem Figure 6a) shows two baseline cases for two speeds (40 and 100 km/h), where it is possible to observe the influence of speed on the dynamic response. The amplifying effect\nof speed can influence the identification of damage, which is why a robust baseline with a wide range of scenarios is very important. At a speed of 40 km/h, lower accelerations\naround 0. m/s⊃2 are observed. In contrast, at a speed of 100 km/h (considerably higher),\naccelerations increase substantially to around 3. m/s⊃2. This illustrates the significant**Figure 6.** Acceleration time-series in sensor A1 for Laagrss vehicle: (a) influence of speed, (b) influencehigher speeds.

After obtaining the acceleration measurements from the numerical simulations, an FFT algorithm is applied to the time series allowing the conversion of the signal from the time domain to the frequency domain. Then,predefined hyperparameters of the algorithm. The set hyperparameters are encoding and\ndecoding transfer functions, hidden layer size, maximum number of epochs, L2 weight regularisation term, sparsity regularisation term and a sparsity proportion term. Afterwards,**Figure 7.** Flowchart with the main phases of the methodology for detection and classification of OORthe features are extracted in the more compressed layer of the SAE, the so-called bottleneck layer. The number of features obtained is equal to the number of hidden layers which\nis usually considerably lower than the data size, allowing a compression of the input data.\nFurthermore, to enhance the sensitivity to damage, two levels of data fusion are applied to the bottleneck features using the Mahalanobis distance. In the first level, all features are\nfused into a damage index (DI) for each sensor and, in the second level, all the sensors\nare merged resulting in only one DI for each simulation. Finally, automatic damage detection is achieved by performing an outlier analysis, in which a statistical confidence limit\n(CB) is used, based on the Inverse Cumulative Gaussian Distribution Function (ICDF).\nFor feature classification, an automatic clustering process based on the k-means technique is implemented. This algorithm allows for the unsupervised and automatic classification of data, based on the calculation of statistical distances between objects. In k-means technique given a vector of data and chosen k clusters, the key is to find k centroids that minimise\nthe distance of each vector to its nearest centroid . Since it is necessary to define the number of clusters in advance, a global Silhouette index (SIL) was adopted to make\nan automatic process. At the end, the clusters will allow the classification of the two typesbetween the number of correct classifications and the total number of cases.damage detection problems, as it allows a signal to be converted from the time domain to the frequency domain, to capture the excitation frequencies induced by the wheel defects.\nIn addition, a data reduction is carried out at this stage, since the initial records contain aa crossing speed of 80 km/h. When comparing the FFT spectra for a train passage with flats, Figure 8a), with polygonal wheels, Figure 8b), there are visible differences in terms\nof amplitude peak values and excited frequency ranges. For flats, the amplitude peak values are higher and they induce frequencies in the range between DC and 1500accordance with some authors reports . In terms of severities, for flats, the more severe group (55–100 mm) is the one with the higher frequency content, as expected,a baseline response. For polygonal wheels, from the analysis of Figure 8b), it can be seen the frequency peaks for the H12–14 and H17–18 profiles around 100 and 150\nrespectively, while for the profile H6-8 a more flat spectrum is obtained without showing any significant peak. This can be explained by the irregularity level profile of thisThese two graphs can show which frequencies have higher content in the original signal.Autoencoders are artificial neural networks trained using an unsupervised approach,\nwhich aim first to learn coded representations of the data, compressing the input into\na latent space representation, and second, through this compressed information, reconstructing the information. The basic architecture of this type of network consists of threewhere **Wij**, **Wjk** are the weights connection matrices between input layer-hidden\nlayer and hidden layer-output layer, **X** = ( **X** 1, **X** 2, . . ., **Xn** ) is the input data vector,\n**H** = ( **H** 1, . . ., **Hm** ) is the low-dimensional vector and **X** [ˆ] = ( **X** [ˆ] 1, **X** [ˆ] 2, . . ., **X** [ˆ] **n** ) is the output**Figure 8.** Frequency domain responses on position 1 for the crossing speed of 80 km/h: (a) wheel flats,data vector. **b** 1, **b** 2 are bias vectors and σ 1, σ 2 are the activation function used in each of thereconstruction of the input X [ˆ], as shown in Equation (3).

After incorporating various inputs into the SSAE training, they are integrated into the so-called\n‘Input 1’. As training progresses, the data is compressed, and the main characteristics of the signals are obtained and retained in ‘Bottleneck 1’. Subsequently, these characteristics are\nused as input for training the second sparse autoencoder, which, after further compression,\nenables the extraction of the final features. Depending on the type of data under analysis,\nthe compression level differs, so multiple tests should be conducted to optimise these layer sizes. This optimisation was achieved by trial and test, changing both the size of the first\nIt should be noted that this network architecture, where the dimensions of the layers gradually decrease along the network until reaching the bottleneck layer , has proven\nto be highly robust for the type of data used. It allows for effective compression of results**Figure 9.** Schematic of the structure of the SSAE neural network used in this study.After extracting the features from the bottleneck layer of the SSAE, the difference between the healthy wheels scenarios and the damage wheels scenarios is still not sufficient. Hence\na data fusion is performed. With this fusion, it is possible to increase the sensitivity of the\nfeatures, and as a result, to obtain a damage index (DI) for each simulation. Thus, the Mahalanobis distance (MD) is used to reduce the volume of extracted data and preserve the most relevant information . Briefly, MD is a metric that measures the distance between two points in a feature space consisting of two or more variables, being independent of the\nscale of the features, thus allowing an increase in the sensitivity of the features to cases with damage. The MD, denoted here as DI, is calculated for each simulation using the followingin which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−], and ¯ x is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The MD is calculated for each sensor and for each simulation, obtaining a matrix of n distances per k number of sensors.Finally, the discrimination of the features consists in distinguishing the features as corresponding to a healthy or damaged case. At this stage of the methodology, an analysis of\nabnormal values is carried out, which will allow the condition of the train wheels to beautomatically monitored and these values to be classified into different classes. This phaseThe outlier analysis consists of grouping, by probabilistic distribution processes, the datato the previously created group. For this, a statistical confidence limit (CB) is used, based on the inverse cumulative Gaussian distribution function (ICDF), considering the mean\nvalue, ¯ μ, and standard deviation, σ, of the baseline feature vector.Whenever a value of a DI indicator is equal to or greater than CB, it is considered an outlier (the null hypothesis is rejected), thus representing a case of damage.For feature classification, a clustering process is used to divide the dataset into distinct clusters that should be as compact and separated as possible . For clustering, the k-meanson the distances of their vectors. Recent studies showed that the k-means algorithm has shown promising results . The main limitation of this technique is that it requires\nknowledge of the number of clusters in advance. For this purpose, the global silhouetteThis section presents the main results obtained through the application of the methodology proposed in section 3 to the calculated track responses. The methodology is applied using damaged wheel passages for the three simulated train speeds (60, 80 and 100 km/h),hyperparameters (presented in section 3). By adjusting these hyperparameters, it is possible to make the algorithm more efficient and improve the generalisation capabilities, as only\nthe most important features are retained. The optimisation of these hyperparameters isof data under analysis. Based on the principles of the SAE already outlined in other works\nIn the context of this study, the non-linear transfer functions (logsig) proved to be more effective than the linear ones, being the ones used in all the studied cases. After analysing Table 3, there is a similarity in the hyperparameters when comparing the two types of OOR damage. It is observed that the data compression level is the same for both cases, around\n93%, as 500 features are extracted in Bottleneck 2 from the initial input data with 7000\nConcerning the type of damage situation, the size of the ‘Bottleneck 1’ and ‘Bottleneck\n2’ was increased to bring them even closer to the initial amount of input data. This can beanalysis, making it challenging for the autoencoder to define relationships between the data, hence requiring a larger number. On the contrary, the maximum number of epochsIt is also important to emphasise that of the various hyperparameters presented, theOnce the hyperparameters have been defined, all the steps of the methodology are applied to the new dataset. For simplicity, in this section, only the last phase of the methodology will be presented, namely an outlier analysis for damage detection and cluster analysis for damage classification. For each sensor, a matrix n × m is created, where n\nis the number of test passages (baseline scenarios + damage scenarios), and m represents the number of extracted features. So, the size of the matrices is 210 × 2000 in case of the\ntype of damage, 75 × 500 for each amplitude in polygonal wheel, and 120 × 500 for wheelDespite the visual distinction between healthy and damaged wheels based on the data processing presented in subsection 3.2, unsupervised learning must use strategies capable of automatically detecting damage. To this end, an outlier analysis is employed, which consists of defining a confidence threshold using a significance level of 1% , represented**Figure 10.** Automatic OOR damage detection based on outlier analysis.by the green line in Figure 10. This approach makes it possible to successfully detect allTo distinguish the two types of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed. Figure 11\nshows a clear distinction between the damage, even when using a dataset with three different train speeds (60,80 and 100 km/h).. In the case of Figure 11a), using all four\naccelerometers, it is possible to efficiently separate the set into two large clusters, despite\n30 misclassifications (16 in the polygonisation and 14 in the flats). Even so, the accuracy\npercentage is around 85%, which is a very good result. To analyse the sensitivity to the number of sensors, only two sensors were used, one on each side ). The results\nimproved, with a decrease in the number of misclassifications from 30 to 21 (13 for polygonisation and 8 for flats). One explanation could be the disparity in sensor sensitivity to the damage, where some sensors are more sensitive than others due to their spatial positioning in relation to the damage. By merging the data from the less sensitive sensors with the\nmore sensitive ones, this could have a negative impact on the results. Thus, the percentage\nThe purpose behind presenting these two plots was to demonstrate that, whether using 4 sensors or 2 sensors, the classification remains remarkably robust, showing lowAfter identifying the type of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed once again to\nclassify the severity of each damage separately. Regarding polygonal wheels, the classification involves both amplitude and harmonic orders, leading to the clusters depicted in the obtained clusters reasonably reflect the two amplitude groups, with all misclassifications associated with the H6-8 harmonic cases (17 misclassifications). Once the amplitude\nis identified, harmonic classification must be carried out separately for each of the amplitudes. In Figure 12b), related to amplitude A1, it is observed that the obtained clusters**Figure 11.** Automatic OOR damage classification based on cluster analysis using: a) 4 sensors; b) 2are nearly perfect, with only 3 misclassifications. In Figure 12c), there are only 3 misclassifications, totalling 8 misclassifications in the classification of the number of dominant\nThe classification of harmonic order is only possible with the separation of amplitudes,\nFigure 13 presents the clusters obtained for the wheel flat cases. The separation between\nthe less severe group and baseline cases and intermediate (cluster 3) and severe cases (cluster 4) is reduced, resulting in a total of 19 misclassifications. Nevertheless, this result showsrate of about 84%. One possible reason for this significant number of misclassifications could be directly associated with the number of impacts captured by the sensor.In order to contribute to the safety of railway transportation and service quality, an automatic methodology based on machine learning has been proposed. This methodology can accurately detect and classify two types of OOR wheel damage in railway vehicles allowing to mitigate problems at both track and vehicle level, such as derailments or material\ndegradation. It includes a new technique for feature extraction based on a dedicated neural network, the Sparse Autoencoder. This non-linear technique is an upgrade concerning the commonly used linear techniques for feature extraction since it allows a better normalisation of the operational effects in the analysed data, as well as the reduction of large amounts\nof data without relying on other techniques, while keeping the most valuable information. These improvements are achieved through the use of different hyperparameters in**Figure 12.** Automatic classification of polygonal wheels based on cluster analysis: a) amplitude A1-A2;**Figure 13.** Automatic classification of wheel flats based on cluster analysis.the calculations, such as non-linear activation functions and sparsity terms. Consequently,circulation. Particularly in the railway engineering field, the inclusion of this technique\nshowed a good potential to deal with variable train speeds, essentially due to the amplifying effect on the measured track dynamic responses which could induce errors in damage The application of the methodology to the data set proved to be very successful in detecting and classifying the two types of OOR damages. Damage detection was perfect, without\nany false detection. In terms of classifying the type of damage, the results are very good,\nwith a success rate of around 85%, but if only two accelerometers are considered the successrate increases to around 90%. These results are encouraging since the range of speeds considered in the analysis, between 60 and 100 km/h, is the most representative of in-service\nfreight trains. Also, the results show that including the Sparse Autoencoder has a positive\neffect in the normalization of the train speed in the damage data set.\nRegarding the severity classification for each type of damage, the methodology proved equally successful in clustering the different damage severities. For polygonal wheels, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the severity groups in terms of defect amplitude, failing only for the H6-8 harmonic cases, and in terms of harmonic orders for each amplitude,\nwith almost perfect results. For wheel flats, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the three severity groups, though with some misclassifications between the less severe group\nand baseline cases and between intermediate and severe cases. A success rate of around 86%\nis achieved in the classification of polygonal wheel severities and 84% in the classification of wheel flat severities. Even so, these high success rates of over 80% show the robustness\nof this methodology in damage classification regardless of the train speed.on on-site measurements. Additionally, this methodology could be carried out for other types of railway vehicles, for example, passenger vehicles, since the dynamic responses are\ndifferent from freight vehicles. In that case, exploring other recent types of autoencoders,\nTo increase the complexity of the problem, the objective is to explore the concept of\nmultiple damages (same or different OOR types). For this, it will be necessary to incorporate a new stage in the methodology, the damage location stage, which will make it possible\nto distinguish isolated damage from multiple damage, as well as their respective location.\nThus, damage will be identified using cut signals, which will then be used to classify theThis work is a result of project WAY4SafeRail-WAYside monitoring system FOR SAFE RAIL transportation, with reference NORTE-01-0247-FEDER-069595, co-funded by the European Regional\nDevelopment Fund (ERDF), through the North Portugal Regional Operational Programme\nPartnership Agreement.

Within this context,\nan unsupervised methodology based on artificial intelligence techniques is presented, which allows the detection and classification of wheels, based on dynamic responses induced on the track by crossing freight railway vehicles. The methodology involves the following\nsteps: (i) data collection and pre-processing, (ii) feature extraction (iii)\ndata fusion and (iv) feature discrimination. In the first phase, an FFT\nalgorithm is applied to the acceleration track responses. Then, features are extracted after training a Stacked Sparse Autoencoder, in which the main features of the responses are obtained after a compression stage using an encoder network. This lower dimensional\nlayer forces the model to learn a compression of the input data. Then,\nwhich enhances the sensitivity to the damage recognition. Posteriorly, an outlier analysis is performed to distinguish a healthy wheelRail vehicle wheels are subjected to constant wear and tear due to continuous use and inadequate maintenance plans. Over time, this wear and tear can generate more significant defects, so it is extremely important to use sensing to understand when maintenance of both the track and rolling stock is required.

However, this type of system entail high costs envisaging the vehicle wheel condition monitoring, since sensors need to be installed in every vehicle in order to achieve a good representativity . On the other hand, wayside systems are a more viable solution for identifying wheel defects, since the condition of allThe most common wheel defects are known as OOR. As the name infers, this defect is related to deformations on the surface of the wheel circumference that make it not round.\nThis deformation can have many forms and different causes, leading to faults on the vehicle and on the track due to the higher dynamic force values [4–6]. The OOR damagesa function of their shape and size, vehicle characteristics and speed [7–10]. Wheel flats induce high dynamic impact loads on the railway infrastructure, which causes significant damage to both tracks and vehicles, such as broken axles, damaged rolling bearings and cracks in the wheels, rails and sleepers . Moreover, it also generates high vibrations\ntransmitted to the rolling stock, inducing significant stresses and causing damage to the In the case of polygonal wheels, the formation mechanism can be roughly classified\ninto three categories, namely, (1) initial wheel defects , (2) a natural vibration of the\nvehicle–track system and (3) thermoelastic instability . The formation mechanism is strongly contingent on the vehicle type and its operational characteristics, withof dominant harmonic orders [19–22]. For example, Tao et al. studied asymmetrical polygonal wear on metro wheels and obtained harmonic orders of 12–14, while another study by Tao et al. found that the most common harmonic order in Chinese freight trains is 18–19. Although a polygonal wheel could generate less impact on the track than a\nwheel flat, this defect can cause serious damage to the track due to resonance effects in the\nTo identify the occurrence of these OOR anomalies in train wheels, innovative\nmethodologies have been developed combining signal processing and automatic learning techniques. These methodologies are based on the extraction of damage sensitivity features, making possible the distinction between undamaged and damaged situations. Recently, many studies have shown good results in detecting OOR damages using\ndistinct approaches [24–29]. Mishra et al. concluded that a single FBG (Fiber Bragg Grating) sensor, positioned along the rail can detect the presence of wheel flats.\nLourenço et al. created an automatic algorithm for diagnosing OOR defects. The\nproposed methodology consists of isolating specific defective wheels and then identifying the severity of the damage, using only acceleration and strain data measured on\nthe track. In another study, Krummenacher et al. , proposed two machine-learningBy extracting the features, it is possible to transform the measured data into an alternative form of information where the correlation with damage is more easily observed. There are various techniques for feature extraction, the most common being CWT\n(continuous wavelet transform) [31–33], PCA (principal component analysis) ,detection of polygonal wheels on freight vehicles using CWT and ARX features, using\n6 accelerometers, 3 on each side of the railway track. Mosleh et al. introduced aflats by extracting AR features from acceleration records. Moreover, Mohammadi et al.\nadopted linear features, particularly, CWT, PCA, ARX and AR, and their research findingsin the context of wheel flat damage detection. Although these studies have demonstrated robust results in detection, they show some limitations in dealing with the non-linear effects associated with operational effects, such as the train speed. Due to the inability of these linear techniques to attenuate operation effects, the inclusion of different speeds\nFor most of these studies, a feature normalisation stage is used when it is necessary to remove the operational effects. Usually, latent variable methods are used, such as PCA or multiple linear regression (MLR) . Thus, to deal with the non-linear phenomena and reduce the large amounts of data without relying on the aforementioned methods,\nthe first artificial neural networks were created to inherently execute this task . Over the years, new and more advanced networks have been developed, with the Autoencoder\n(AE) being one of the main types. Later, Olshausen et al. proposed the creation of\nsparse coding and Ng et al. introduced a sparse penalisation term in the hidden layer,\nto acquire more compact and effective features from lower-dimensional data. For some datasets with complex relationships between characteristics, employing more than one SAE\nis necessary, which is why stacked sparse autoencoders (SSAE) are commonly used .\nNowadays, these types of AE are widely used in various scientific fields, but specifically\nfor structural engineering only a few studies are found, and most are about damage detection on bridges [45–47].

The application of sensors on both sides of theTo obtain the responses from the railway track, it is necessary to apply sensors on the track that can measure the dynamic responses of the crossing trains. As it is not always possible\nto install them due to the high costs involved, simulations have been carried out based on calibrated models of the track , vehicle and considering their dynamic interaction,\nas well as including the track irregularities. Simulations include cases with healthy wheelsTo simulate the dynamic interactions between the vehicle and the track, an in-house software VSI – Vehicle-Structure Interaction Analysis is used, which was initially developed by\nNeves et al. and later improved by Montenegro et al. .

Including the track irregularities directly in the constraint equations are beneficial since it avoids explicitly considering\nthem in the FEM model. Moreover, it also allows to include the wheel and OOR profiles as a periodic rail irregularity, simplifying the analysis. Thus, before starting the analysis, the\nVSI software imports track irregularities and OOR profiles from a MATLAB file, whichto the vertical and lateral irregularities in each rail in each respective position, and adds it to the constraint equations of the system throughout the dynamics analysis. Then, the\nsystem of dynamic equations is solved using the typical Newmark integration method.\nThe impact of track irregularity on wheel defect classification is significant, as a lower track quality tends to result in a higher likelihood of misclassification. A comprehensive\nexploration of this influence was previously undertaken by Mosleh et al. as documented in their research study . Hence, this study does not delve into the impact of track\nquality; rather, it primarily centres on the utilisation of AI-based methodologies for the detection and classification of wheel defects. For this, four different profiles are used, based\non European Standard EN 13848–2 . In this case, power spectral density (PSD) curvesFor OOR defects, several profiles are defined based on real measurements in representative profiles of the various severities. Subsequently, the structural matrices are imported\nMore details on track and train properties, including additional information on traintrack interaction, can be found in previous publications . Figure 1 shows the\nvehicle–track interaction model schematisation and some details about the train and track\nsubsystems, as well as the track irregularities and wheel-rail contact model.According to the conclusions reached in other studies with this type of damage ,\nthe most promising location of the sensors is on the rail. To reduce installation and maintenance costs, it is important to reduce the number of sensors without compromising the\nquality of the results. Therefore, based on a sensitivity analysis performed during the study,\nonly two vertical unidirectional accelerometers were used on each rail, 4 in total (A1 to A4),\nsince they provided a higher cost–benefit ratio. These sensors are mounted on the rail atdefects, different simulation scenarios with perfect wheels (baseline) and OOR wheels\n(damage) were defined for a five-wagon Laagrss freight train. Based on different crossing speeds, loading schemes and rail irregularities profiles, 120 baseline and 180 damage scenarios (90 for polygonal wheels and 90 for wheel flats) were defined, as summarised in For baseline scenarios, six loading schemes with five different speeds (40, 60, 80, 100\nand 120 km/h) and four rail irregularity profiles were considered, giving a total of 120 scenarios. The loading schemes used are: empty, half-loaded, full-loaded and, additionally,For the damage cases, a total of 90 scenarios were generated for polygonal wheels. These\nscenarios including 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (H1, H2 and H3) x 10 different irregularity profiles within each specified harmonic interval. In these 10 irregularity\nprofiles, based on the defect amplitude, two amplitudes are considered, five simulations for\nA1 and five simulations for A2. Similarly, 90 scenarios were created for wheel flats, involving 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (F1, F2 and F3) x 10 different irregularitywheel radius . This wave phenomenon can be characterised by the different wavelengths formed (harmonics θ ), and by the levels of irregularity ( Lw ) associated with each of the harmonics. According to Peng , it is considered a polygonal wheel when the wear amplitude assumes values above 0. mm and wavelengths between 140 mm and the wheelTo define scenarios with polygonal wheels for the Laagrss wagon, a literature survey on\nexperimental measurements in defective wheels was conducted .

After obtaining the acceleration measurements from the numerical simulations, an FFT algorithm is applied to the time series allowing the conversion of the signal from the time domain to the frequency domain. Then,predefined hyperparameters of the algorithm. The set hyperparameters are encoding and\ndecoding transfer functions, hidden layer size, maximum number of epochs, L2 weight regularisation term, sparsity regularisation term and a sparsity proportion term. Afterwards,**Figure 7.** Flowchart with the main phases of the methodology for detection and classification of OORthe features are extracted in the more compressed layer of the SAE, the so-called bottleneck layer. The number of features obtained is equal to the number of hidden layers which\nis usually considerably lower than the data size, allowing a compression of the input data.\nFurthermore, to enhance the sensitivity to damage, two levels of data fusion are applied to the bottleneck features using the Mahalanobis distance. In the first level, all features are\nfused into a damage index (DI) for each sensor and, in the second level, all the sensors\nare merged resulting in only one DI for each simulation. Finally, automatic damage detection is achieved by performing an outlier analysis, in which a statistical confidence limit\n(CB) is used, based on the Inverse Cumulative Gaussian Distribution Function (ICDF).\nFor feature classification, an automatic clustering process based on the k-means technique is implemented. This algorithm allows for the unsupervised and automatic classification of data, based on the calculation of statistical distances between objects. In k-means technique given a vector of data and chosen k clusters, the key is to find k centroids that minimise\nthe distance of each vector to its nearest centroid . Since it is necessary to define the number of clusters in advance, a global Silhouette index (SIL) was adopted to make\nan automatic process. At the end, the clusters will allow the classification of the two typesbetween the number of correct classifications and the total number of cases.damage detection problems, as it allows a signal to be converted from the time domain to the frequency domain, to capture the excitation frequencies induced by the wheel defects.\nIn addition, a data reduction is carried out at this stage, since the initial records contain aa crossing speed of 80 km/h. When comparing the FFT spectra for a train passage with flats, Figure 8a), with polygonal wheels, Figure 8b), there are visible differences in terms\nof amplitude peak values and excited frequency ranges. For flats, the amplitude peak values are higher and they induce frequencies in the range between DC and 1500accordance with some authors reports . In terms of severities, for flats, the more severe group (55–100 mm) is the one with the higher frequency content, as expected,a baseline response. For polygonal wheels, from the analysis of Figure 8b), it can be seen the frequency peaks for the H12–14 and H17–18 profiles around 100 and 150\nrespectively, while for the profile H6-8 a more flat spectrum is obtained without showing any significant peak. This can be explained by the irregularity level profile of thisThese two graphs can show which frequencies have higher content in the original signal.Autoencoders are artificial neural networks trained using an unsupervised approach,\nwhich aim first to learn coded representations of the data, compressing the input into\na latent space representation, and second, through this compressed information, reconstructing the information. The basic architecture of this type of network consists of threewhere **Wij**, **Wjk** are the weights connection matrices between input layer-hidden\nlayer and hidden layer-output layer, **X** = ( **X** 1, **X** 2, . . ., **Xn** ) is the input data vector,\n**H** = ( **H** 1, . . ., **Hm** ) is the low-dimensional vector and **X** [ˆ] = ( **X** [ˆ] 1, **X** [ˆ] 2, . . ., **X** [ˆ] **n** ) is the output**Figure 8.** Frequency domain responses on position 1 for the crossing speed of 80 km/h: (a) wheel flats,data vector. **b** 1, **b** 2 are bias vectors and σ 1, σ 2 are the activation function used in each of thereconstruction of the input X [ˆ], as shown in Equation (3).

After incorporating various inputs into the SSAE training, they are integrated into the so-called\n‘Input 1’. As training progresses, the data is compressed, and the main characteristics of the signals are obtained and retained in ‘Bottleneck 1’. Subsequently, these characteristics are\nused as input for training the second sparse autoencoder, which, after further compression,\nenables the extraction of the final features. Depending on the type of data under analysis,\nthe compression level differs, so multiple tests should be conducted to optimise these layer sizes. This optimisation was achieved by trial and test, changing both the size of the first\nIt should be noted that this network architecture, where the dimensions of the layers gradually decrease along the network until reaching the bottleneck layer , has proven\nto be highly robust for the type of data used. It allows for effective compression of results**Figure 9.** Schematic of the structure of the SSAE neural network used in this study.After extracting the features from the bottleneck layer of the SSAE, the difference between the healthy wheels scenarios and the damage wheels scenarios is still not sufficient. Hence\na data fusion is performed. With this fusion, it is possible to increase the sensitivity of the\nfeatures, and as a result, to obtain a damage index (DI) for each simulation. Thus, the Mahalanobis distance (MD) is used to reduce the volume of extracted data and preserve the most relevant information . Briefly, MD is a metric that measures the distance between two points in a feature space consisting of two or more variables, being independent of the\nscale of the features, thus allowing an increase in the sensitivity of the features to cases with damage. The MD, denoted here as DI, is calculated for each simulation using the followingin which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−], and ¯ x is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The MD is calculated for each sensor and for each simulation, obtaining a matrix of n distances per k number of sensors.Finally, the discrimination of the features consists in distinguishing the features as corresponding to a healthy or damaged case. At this stage of the methodology, an analysis of\nabnormal values is carried out, which will allow the condition of the train wheels to beautomatically monitored and these values to be classified into different classes. This phaseThe outlier analysis consists of grouping, by probabilistic distribution processes, the datato the previously created group. For this, a statistical confidence limit (CB) is used, based on the inverse cumulative Gaussian distribution function (ICDF), considering the mean\nvalue, ¯ μ, and standard deviation, σ, of the baseline feature vector.Whenever a value of a DI indicator is equal to or greater than CB, it is considered an outlier (the null hypothesis is rejected), thus representing a case of damage.For feature classification, a clustering process is used to divide the dataset into distinct clusters that should be as compact and separated as possible . For clustering, the k-meanson the distances of their vectors. Recent studies showed that the k-means algorithm has shown promising results . The main limitation of this technique is that it requires\nknowledge of the number of clusters in advance. For this purpose, the global silhouetteThis section presents the main results obtained through the application of the methodology proposed in section 3 to the calculated track responses. The methodology is applied using damaged wheel passages for the three simulated train speeds (60, 80 and 100 km/h),hyperparameters (presented in section 3). By adjusting these hyperparameters, it is possible to make the algorithm more efficient and improve the generalisation capabilities, as only\nthe most important features are retained. The optimisation of these hyperparameters isof data under analysis. Based on the principles of the SAE already outlined in other works\nIn the context of this study, the non-linear transfer functions (logsig) proved to be more effective than the linear ones, being the ones used in all the studied cases. After analysing Table 3, there is a similarity in the hyperparameters when comparing the two types of OOR damage. It is observed that the data compression level is the same for both cases, around\n93%, as 500 features are extracted in Bottleneck 2 from the initial input data with 7000\nConcerning the type of damage situation, the size of the ‘Bottleneck 1’ and ‘Bottleneck\n2’ was increased to bring them even closer to the initial amount of input data. This can beanalysis, making it challenging for the autoencoder to define relationships between the data, hence requiring a larger number. On the contrary, the maximum number of epochsIt is also important to emphasise that of the various hyperparameters presented, theOnce the hyperparameters have been defined, all the steps of the methodology are applied to the new dataset. For simplicity, in this section, only the last phase of the methodology will be presented, namely an outlier analysis for damage detection and cluster analysis for damage classification. For each sensor, a matrix n × m is created, where n\nis the number of test passages (baseline scenarios + damage scenarios), and m represents the number of extracted features. So, the size of the matrices is 210 × 2000 in case of the\ntype of damage, 75 × 500 for each amplitude in polygonal wheel, and 120 × 500 for wheelDespite the visual distinction between healthy and damaged wheels based on the data processing presented in subsection 3.2, unsupervised learning must use strategies capable of automatically detecting damage. To this end, an outlier analysis is employed, which consists of defining a confidence threshold using a significance level of 1% , represented**Figure 10.** Automatic OOR damage detection based on outlier analysis.by the green line in Figure 10. This approach makes it possible to successfully detect allTo distinguish the two types of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed. Figure 11\nshows a clear distinction between the damage, even when using a dataset with three different train speeds (60,80 and 100 km/h).. In the case of Figure 11a), using all four\naccelerometers, it is possible to efficiently separate the set into two large clusters, despite\n30 misclassifications (16 in the polygonisation and 14 in the flats). Even so, the accuracy\npercentage is around 85%, which is a very good result. To analyse the sensitivity to the number of sensors, only two sensors were used, one on each side ). The results\nimproved, with a decrease in the number of misclassifications from 30 to 21 (13 for polygonisation and 8 for flats). One explanation could be the disparity in sensor sensitivity to the damage, where some sensors are more sensitive than others due to their spatial positioning in relation to the damage. By merging the data from the less sensitive sensors with the\nmore sensitive ones, this could have a negative impact on the results. Thus, the percentage\nThe purpose behind presenting these two plots was to demonstrate that, whether using 4 sensors or 2 sensors, the classification remains remarkably robust, showing lowAfter identifying the type of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed once again to\nclassify the severity of each damage separately. Regarding polygonal wheels, the classification involves both amplitude and harmonic orders, leading to the clusters depicted in the obtained clusters reasonably reflect the two amplitude groups, with all misclassifications associated with the H6-8 harmonic cases (17 misclassifications). Once the amplitude\nis identified, harmonic classification must be carried out separately for each of the amplitudes. In Figure 12b), related to amplitude A1, it is observed that the obtained clusters**Figure 11.** Automatic OOR damage classification based on cluster analysis using: a) 4 sensors; b) 2are nearly perfect, with only 3 misclassifications. In Figure 12c), there are only 3 misclassifications, totalling 8 misclassifications in the classification of the number of dominant\nThe classification of harmonic order is only possible with the separation of amplitudes,\nFigure 13 presents the clusters obtained for the wheel flat cases. The separation between\nthe less severe group and baseline cases and intermediate (cluster 3) and severe cases (cluster 4) is reduced, resulting in a total of 19 misclassifications. Nevertheless, this result showsrate of about 84%. One possible reason for this significant number of misclassifications could be directly associated with the number of impacts captured by the sensor.In order to contribute to the safety of railway transportation and service quality, an automatic methodology based on machine learning has been proposed. This methodology can accurately detect and classify two types of OOR wheel damage in railway vehicles allowing to mitigate problems at both track and vehicle level, such as derailments or material\ndegradation. It includes a new technique for feature extraction based on a dedicated neural network, the Sparse Autoencoder. This non-linear technique is an upgrade concerning the commonly used linear techniques for feature extraction since it allows a better normalisation of the operational effects in the analysed data, as well as the reduction of large amounts\nof data without relying on other techniques, while keeping the most valuable information. These improvements are achieved through the use of different hyperparameters in**Figure 12.** Automatic classification of polygonal wheels based on cluster analysis: a) amplitude A1-A2;**Figure 13.** Automatic classification of wheel flats based on cluster analysis.the calculations, such as non-linear activation functions and sparsity terms. Consequently,circulation. Particularly in the railway engineering field, the inclusion of this technique\nshowed a good potential to deal with variable train speeds, essentially due to the amplifying effect on the measured track dynamic responses which could induce errors in damage The application of the methodology to the data set proved to be very successful in detecting and classifying the two types of OOR damages. Damage detection was perfect, without\nany false detection. In terms of classifying the type of damage, the results are very good,\nwith a success rate of around 85%, but if only two accelerometers are considered the successrate increases to around 90%. These results are encouraging since the range of speeds considered in the analysis, between 60 and 100 km/h, is the most representative of in-service\nfreight trains. Also, the results show that including the Sparse Autoencoder has a positive\neffect in the normalization of the train speed in the damage data set.\nRegarding the severity classification for each type of damage, the methodology proved equally successful in clustering the different damage severities. For polygonal wheels, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the severity groups in terms of defect amplitude, failing only for the H6-8 harmonic cases, and in terms of harmonic orders for each amplitude,\nwith almost perfect results. For wheel flats, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the three severity groups, though with some misclassifications between the less severe group\nand baseline cases and between intermediate and severe cases. A success rate of around 86%\nis achieved in the classification of polygonal wheel severities and 84% in the classification of wheel flat severities. Even so, these high success rates of over 80% show the robustness\nof this methodology in damage classification regardless of the train speed.on on-site measurements. Additionally, this methodology could be carried out for other types of railway vehicles, for example, passenger vehicles, since the dynamic responses are\ndifferent from freight vehicles. In that case, exploring other recent types of autoencoders,\nTo increase the complexity of the problem, the objective is to explore the concept of\nmultiple damages (same or different OOR types). For this, it will be necessary to incorporate a new stage in the methodology, the damage location stage, which will make it possible\nto distinguish isolated damage from multiple damage, as well as their respective location.\nThus, damage will be identified using cut signals, which will then be used to classify theThis work is a result of project WAY4SafeRail-WAYside monitoring system FOR SAFE RAIL transportation, with reference NORTE-01-0247-FEDER-069595, co-funded by the European Regional\nDevelopment Fund (ERDF), through the North Portugal Regional Operational Programme\nPartnership Agreement.

However, this type of system entail high costs envisaging the vehicle wheel condition monitoring, since sensors need to be installed in every vehicle in order to achieve a good representativity . On the other hand, wayside systems are a more viable solution for identifying wheel defects, since the condition of allThe most common wheel defects are known as OOR. As the name infers, this defect is related to deformations on the surface of the wheel circumference that make it not round.\nThis deformation can have many forms and different causes, leading to faults on the vehicle and on the track due to the higher dynamic force values [4–6]. The OOR damagesa function of their shape and size, vehicle characteristics and speed [7–10]. Wheel flats induce high dynamic impact loads on the railway infrastructure, which causes significant damage to both tracks and vehicles, such as broken axles, damaged rolling bearings and cracks in the wheels, rails and sleepers . Moreover, it also generates high vibrations\ntransmitted to the rolling stock, inducing significant stresses and causing damage to the In the case of polygonal wheels, the formation mechanism can be roughly classified\ninto three categories, namely, (1) initial wheel defects , (2) a natural vibration of the\nvehicle–track system and (3) thermoelastic instability . The formation mechanism is strongly contingent on the vehicle type and its operational characteristics, withof dominant harmonic orders [19–22]. For example, Tao et al. studied asymmetrical polygonal wear on metro wheels and obtained harmonic orders of 12–14, while another study by Tao et al. found that the most common harmonic order in Chinese freight trains is 18–19. Although a polygonal wheel could generate less impact on the track than a\nwheel flat, this defect can cause serious damage to the track due to resonance effects in the\nTo identify the occurrence of these OOR anomalies in train wheels, innovative\nmethodologies have been developed combining signal processing and automatic learning techniques. These methodologies are based on the extraction of damage sensitivity features, making possible the distinction between undamaged and damaged situations. Recently, many studies have shown good results in detecting OOR damages using\ndistinct approaches [24–29]. Mishra et al. concluded that a single FBG (Fiber Bragg Grating) sensor, positioned along the rail can detect the presence of wheel flats.\nLourenço et al. created an automatic algorithm for diagnosing OOR defects. The\nproposed methodology consists of isolating specific defective wheels and then identifying the severity of the damage, using only acceleration and strain data measured on\nthe track. In another study, Krummenacher et al. , proposed two machine-learningBy extracting the features, it is possible to transform the measured data into an alternative form of information where the correlation with damage is more easily observed. There are various techniques for feature extraction, the most common being CWT\n(continuous wavelet transform) [31–33], PCA (principal component analysis) ,detection of polygonal wheels on freight vehicles using CWT and ARX features, using\n6 accelerometers, 3 on each side of the railway track. Mosleh et al. introduced aflats by extracting AR features from acceleration records. Moreover, Mohammadi et al.\nadopted linear features, particularly, CWT, PCA, ARX and AR, and their research findingsin the context of wheel flat damage detection. Although these studies have demonstrated robust results in detection, they show some limitations in dealing with the non-linear effects associated with operational effects, such as the train speed. Due to the inability of these linear techniques to attenuate operation effects, the inclusion of different speeds\nFor most of these studies, a feature normalisation stage is used when it is necessary to remove the operational effects. Usually, latent variable methods are used, such as PCA or multiple linear regression (MLR) . Thus, to deal with the non-linear phenomena and reduce the large amounts of data without relying on the aforementioned methods,\nthe first artificial neural networks were created to inherently execute this task . Over the years, new and more advanced networks have been developed, with the Autoencoder\n(AE) being one of the main types. Later, Olshausen et al. proposed the creation of\nsparse coding and Ng et al. introduced a sparse penalisation term in the hidden layer,\nto acquire more compact and effective features from lower-dimensional data. For some datasets with complex relationships between characteristics, employing more than one SAE\nis necessary, which is why stacked sparse autoencoders (SSAE) are commonly used .\nNowadays, these types of AE are widely used in various scientific fields, but specifically\nfor structural engineering only a few studies are found, and most are about damage detection on bridges [45–47].

Pathirage et al. proposed a framework utilizing SAE’s potential for dimensionality reduction, which facilitated the assessment of damage detection performance on Many of these AE algorithms already performed feature classification in order to discriminate the different types of damages and severities. However, the AE methods can also be combined with other techniques commonly used to classify the data. They can be used unsupervised methods, in which the model is trained without any labels provided to the\ntraining dataset, such as k-means , self-organising maps (SOM) , isolation forest, gaussian mixture model , k-medoids and cluster analysis , or supervised\nmethods, which assume that the hierarchy of database categories is known, such as NaiveBayes classifiers , k-Nearest Neighbours classifiers , Support Vector Machinetwo types of OOR damages, flats and polygonal wheels, based on acceleration responses obtained from a virtual wayside monitoring system.

The application of sensors on both sides of theTo obtain the responses from the railway track, it is necessary to apply sensors on the track that can measure the dynamic responses of the crossing trains. As it is not always possible\nto install them due to the high costs involved, simulations have been carried out based on calibrated models of the track , vehicle and considering their dynamic interaction,\nas well as including the track irregularities. Simulations include cases with healthy wheelsTo simulate the dynamic interactions between the vehicle and the track, an in-house software VSI – Vehicle-Structure Interaction Analysis is used, which was initially developed by\nNeves et al. and later improved by Montenegro et al. .

Including the track irregularities directly in the constraint equations are beneficial since it avoids explicitly considering\nthem in the FEM model. Moreover, it also allows to include the wheel and OOR profiles as a periodic rail irregularity, simplifying the analysis. Thus, before starting the analysis, the\nVSI software imports track irregularities and OOR profiles from a MATLAB file, whichto the vertical and lateral irregularities in each rail in each respective position, and adds it to the constraint equations of the system throughout the dynamics analysis. Then, the\nsystem of dynamic equations is solved using the typical Newmark integration method.\nThe impact of track irregularity on wheel defect classification is significant, as a lower track quality tends to result in a higher likelihood of misclassification. A comprehensive\nexploration of this influence was previously undertaken by Mosleh et al. as documented in their research study . Hence, this study does not delve into the impact of track\nquality; rather, it primarily centres on the utilisation of AI-based methodologies for the detection and classification of wheel defects. For this, four different profiles are used, based\non European Standard EN 13848–2 . In this case, power spectral density (PSD) curvesFor OOR defects, several profiles are defined based on real measurements in representative profiles of the various severities. Subsequently, the structural matrices are imported\nMore details on track and train properties, including additional information on traintrack interaction, can be found in previous publications . Figure 1 shows the\nvehicle–track interaction model schematisation and some details about the train and track\nsubsystems, as well as the track irregularities and wheel-rail contact model.According to the conclusions reached in other studies with this type of damage ,\nthe most promising location of the sensors is on the rail. To reduce installation and maintenance costs, it is important to reduce the number of sensors without compromising the\nquality of the results. Therefore, based on a sensitivity analysis performed during the study,\nonly two vertical unidirectional accelerometers were used on each rail, 4 in total (A1 to A4),\nsince they provided a higher cost–benefit ratio. These sensors are mounted on the rail atdefects, different simulation scenarios with perfect wheels (baseline) and OOR wheels\n(damage) were defined for a five-wagon Laagrss freight train. Based on different crossing speeds, loading schemes and rail irregularities profiles, 120 baseline and 180 damage scenarios (90 for polygonal wheels and 90 for wheel flats) were defined, as summarised in For baseline scenarios, six loading schemes with five different speeds (40, 60, 80, 100\nand 120 km/h) and four rail irregularity profiles were considered, giving a total of 120 scenarios. The loading schemes used are: empty, half-loaded, full-loaded and, additionally,For the damage cases, a total of 90 scenarios were generated for polygonal wheels. These\nscenarios including 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (H1, H2 and H3) x 10 different irregularity profiles within each specified harmonic interval. In these 10 irregularity\nprofiles, based on the defect amplitude, two amplitudes are considered, five simulations for\nA1 and five simulations for A2. Similarly, 90 scenarios were created for wheel flats, involving 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (F1, F2 and F3) x 10 different irregularitywheel radius . This wave phenomenon can be characterised by the different wavelengths formed (harmonics θ ), and by the levels of irregularity ( Lw ) associated with each of the harmonics. According to Peng , it is considered a polygonal wheel when the wear amplitude assumes values above 0. mm and wavelengths between 140 mm and the wheelTo define scenarios with polygonal wheels for the Laagrss wagon, a literature survey on\nexperimental measurements in defective wheels was conducted . Three experimental irregularity profiles were collected, illustrated in Figure 3. The first group (H6-8)\ncorresponds to a study carried out by Cai et al. with dominant harmonics from 6 to 8;**Figure 3.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) of polygonal wheels with**Figure 4.** Examples of polygonal damage profiles for each of the dominant harmonic intervals.the second group (H12-14) to a study authored by Tao et al. with dominant harmonics from 12 to 14; and the third profile (H17-18) to a study performed by Wu et al. with\nBased on the wheel irregularity spectra ( Lw ) taken from the respective measurement profiles, shown in Figure 3, and considering the contribution of the first 30 harmonics, several irregularity profiles were generated, according to Figure 4.

Then,predefined hyperparameters of the algorithm. The set hyperparameters are encoding and\ndecoding transfer functions, hidden layer size, maximum number of epochs, L2 weight regularisation term, sparsity regularisation term and a sparsity proportion term. Afterwards,**Figure 7.** Flowchart with the main phases of the methodology for detection and classification of OORthe features are extracted in the more compressed layer of the SAE, the so-called bottleneck layer. The number of features obtained is equal to the number of hidden layers which\nis usually considerably lower than the data size, allowing a compression of the input data.\nFurthermore, to enhance the sensitivity to damage, two levels of data fusion are applied to the bottleneck features using the Mahalanobis distance. In the first level, all features are\nfused into a damage index (DI) for each sensor and, in the second level, all the sensors\nare merged resulting in only one DI for each simulation. Finally, automatic damage detection is achieved by performing an outlier analysis, in which a statistical confidence limit\n(CB) is used, based on the Inverse Cumulative Gaussian Distribution Function (ICDF).\nFor feature classification, an automatic clustering process based on the k-means technique is implemented. This algorithm allows for the unsupervised and automatic classification of data, based on the calculation of statistical distances between objects. In k-means technique given a vector of data and chosen k clusters, the key is to find k centroids that minimise\nthe distance of each vector to its nearest centroid . Since it is necessary to define the number of clusters in advance, a global Silhouette index (SIL) was adopted to make\nan automatic process. At the end, the clusters will allow the classification of the two typesbetween the number of correct classifications and the total number of cases.damage detection problems, as it allows a signal to be converted from the time domain to the frequency domain, to capture the excitation frequencies induced by the wheel defects.\nIn addition, a data reduction is carried out at this stage, since the initial records contain aa crossing speed of 80 km/h. When comparing the FFT spectra for a train passage with flats, Figure 8a), with polygonal wheels, Figure 8b), there are visible differences in terms\nof amplitude peak values and excited frequency ranges. For flats, the amplitude peak values are higher and they induce frequencies in the range between DC and 1500accordance with some authors reports . In terms of severities, for flats, the more severe group (55–100 mm) is the one with the higher frequency content, as expected,a baseline response. For polygonal wheels, from the analysis of Figure 8b), it can be seen the frequency peaks for the H12–14 and H17–18 profiles around 100 and 150\nrespectively, while for the profile H6-8 a more flat spectrum is obtained without showing any significant peak. This can be explained by the irregularity level profile of thisThese two graphs can show which frequencies have higher content in the original signal.Autoencoders are artificial neural networks trained using an unsupervised approach,\nwhich aim first to learn coded representations of the data, compressing the input into\na latent space representation, and second, through this compressed information, reconstructing the information. The basic architecture of this type of network consists of threewhere **Wij**, **Wjk** are the weights connection matrices between input layer-hidden\nlayer and hidden layer-output layer, **X** = ( **X** 1, **X** 2, . . ., **Xn** ) is the input data vector,\n**H** = ( **H** 1, . . ., **Hm** ) is the low-dimensional vector and **X** [ˆ] = ( **X** [ˆ] 1, **X** [ˆ] 2, . . ., **X** [ˆ] **n** ) is the output**Figure 8.** Frequency domain responses on position 1 for the crossing speed of 80 km/h: (a) wheel flats,data vector. **b** 1, **b** 2 are bias vectors and σ 1, σ 2 are the activation function used in each of thereconstruction of the input X [ˆ], as shown in Equation (3).

After incorporating various inputs into the SSAE training, they are integrated into the so-called\n‘Input 1’. As training progresses, the data is compressed, and the main characteristics of the signals are obtained and retained in ‘Bottleneck 1’. Subsequently, these characteristics are\nused as input for training the second sparse autoencoder, which, after further compression,\nenables the extraction of the final features. Depending on the type of data under analysis,\nthe compression level differs, so multiple tests should be conducted to optimise these layer sizes. This optimisation was achieved by trial and test, changing both the size of the first\nIt should be noted that this network architecture, where the dimensions of the layers gradually decrease along the network until reaching the bottleneck layer , has proven\nto be highly robust for the type of data used. It allows for effective compression of results**Figure 9.** Schematic of the structure of the SSAE neural network used in this study.After extracting the features from the bottleneck layer of the SSAE, the difference between the healthy wheels scenarios and the damage wheels scenarios is still not sufficient. Hence\na data fusion is performed. With this fusion, it is possible to increase the sensitivity of the\nfeatures, and as a result, to obtain a damage index (DI) for each simulation. Thus, the Mahalanobis distance (MD) is used to reduce the volume of extracted data and preserve the most relevant information . Briefly, MD is a metric that measures the distance between two points in a feature space consisting of two or more variables, being independent of the\nscale of the features, thus allowing an increase in the sensitivity of the features to cases with damage. The MD, denoted here as DI, is calculated for each simulation using the followingin which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−], and ¯ x is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The MD is calculated for each sensor and for each simulation, obtaining a matrix of n distances per k number of sensors.Finally, the discrimination of the features consists in distinguishing the features as corresponding to a healthy or damaged case. At this stage of the methodology, an analysis of\nabnormal values is carried out, which will allow the condition of the train wheels to beautomatically monitored and these values to be classified into different classes. This phaseThe outlier analysis consists of grouping, by probabilistic distribution processes, the datato the previously created group. For this, a statistical confidence limit (CB) is used, based on the inverse cumulative Gaussian distribution function (ICDF), considering the mean\nvalue, ¯ μ, and standard deviation, σ, of the baseline feature vector.Whenever a value of a DI indicator is equal to or greater than CB, it is considered an outlier (the null hypothesis is rejected), thus representing a case of damage.For feature classification, a clustering process is used to divide the dataset into distinct clusters that should be as compact and separated as possible . For clustering, the k-meanson the distances of their vectors. Recent studies showed that the k-means algorithm has shown promising results . The main limitation of this technique is that it requires\nknowledge of the number of clusters in advance. For this purpose, the global silhouetteThis section presents the main results obtained through the application of the methodology proposed in section 3 to the calculated track responses. The methodology is applied using damaged wheel passages for the three simulated train speeds (60, 80 and 100 km/h),hyperparameters (presented in section 3). By adjusting these hyperparameters, it is possible to make the algorithm more efficient and improve the generalisation capabilities, as only\nthe most important features are retained. The optimisation of these hyperparameters isof data under analysis. Based on the principles of the SAE already outlined in other works\nIn the context of this study, the non-linear transfer functions (logsig) proved to be more effective than the linear ones, being the ones used in all the studied cases. After analysing Table 3, there is a similarity in the hyperparameters when comparing the two types of OOR damage. It is observed that the data compression level is the same for both cases, around\n93%, as 500 features are extracted in Bottleneck 2 from the initial input data with 7000\nConcerning the type of damage situation, the size of the ‘Bottleneck 1’ and ‘Bottleneck\n2’ was increased to bring them even closer to the initial amount of input data. This can beanalysis, making it challenging for the autoencoder to define relationships between the data, hence requiring a larger number. On the contrary, the maximum number of epochsIt is also important to emphasise that of the various hyperparameters presented, theOnce the hyperparameters have been defined, all the steps of the methodology are applied to the new dataset. For simplicity, in this section, only the last phase of the methodology will be presented, namely an outlier analysis for damage detection and cluster analysis for damage classification. For each sensor, a matrix n × m is created, where n\nis the number of test passages (baseline scenarios + damage scenarios), and m represents the number of extracted features. So, the size of the matrices is 210 × 2000 in case of the\ntype of damage, 75 × 500 for each amplitude in polygonal wheel, and 120 × 500 for wheelDespite the visual distinction between healthy and damaged wheels based on the data processing presented in subsection 3.2, unsupervised learning must use strategies capable of automatically detecting damage. To this end, an outlier analysis is employed, which consists of defining a confidence threshold using a significance level of 1% , represented**Figure 10.** Automatic OOR damage detection based on outlier analysis.by the green line in Figure 10. This approach makes it possible to successfully detect allTo distinguish the two types of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed. Figure 11\nshows a clear distinction between the damage, even when using a dataset with three different train speeds (60,80 and 100 km/h).. In the case of Figure 11a), using all four\naccelerometers, it is possible to efficiently separate the set into two large clusters, despite\n30 misclassifications (16 in the polygonisation and 14 in the flats). Even so, the accuracy\npercentage is around 85%, which is a very good result. To analyse the sensitivity to the number of sensors, only two sensors were used, one on each side ). The results\nimproved, with a decrease in the number of misclassifications from 30 to 21 (13 for polygonisation and 8 for flats). One explanation could be the disparity in sensor sensitivity to the damage, where some sensors are more sensitive than others due to their spatial positioning in relation to the damage. By merging the data from the less sensitive sensors with the\nmore sensitive ones, this could have a negative impact on the results. Thus, the percentage\nThe purpose behind presenting these two plots was to demonstrate that, whether using 4 sensors or 2 sensors, the classification remains remarkably robust, showing lowAfter identifying the type of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed once again to\nclassify the severity of each damage separately. Regarding polygonal wheels, the classification involves both amplitude and harmonic orders, leading to the clusters depicted in the obtained clusters reasonably reflect the two amplitude groups, with all misclassifications associated with the H6-8 harmonic cases (17 misclassifications). Once the amplitude\nis identified, harmonic classification must be carried out separately for each of the amplitudes. In Figure 12b), related to amplitude A1, it is observed that the obtained clusters**Figure 11.** Automatic OOR damage classification based on cluster analysis using: a) 4 sensors; b) 2are nearly perfect, with only 3 misclassifications. In Figure 12c), there are only 3 misclassifications, totalling 8 misclassifications in the classification of the number of dominant\nThe classification of harmonic order is only possible with the separation of amplitudes,\nFigure 13 presents the clusters obtained for the wheel flat cases. The separation between\nthe less severe group and baseline cases and intermediate (cluster 3) and severe cases (cluster 4) is reduced, resulting in a total of 19 misclassifications. Nevertheless, this result showsrate of about 84%. One possible reason for this significant number of misclassifications could be directly associated with the number of impacts captured by the sensor.In order to contribute to the safety of railway transportation and service quality, an automatic methodology based on machine learning has been proposed. This methodology can accurately detect and classify two types of OOR wheel damage in railway vehicles allowing to mitigate problems at both track and vehicle level, such as derailments or material\ndegradation. It includes a new technique for feature extraction based on a dedicated neural network, the Sparse Autoencoder. This non-linear technique is an upgrade concerning the commonly used linear techniques for feature extraction since it allows a better normalisation of the operational effects in the analysed data, as well as the reduction of large amounts\nof data without relying on other techniques, while keeping the most valuable information. These improvements are achieved through the use of different hyperparameters in**Figure 12.** Automatic classification of polygonal wheels based on cluster analysis: a) amplitude A1-A2;**Figure 13.** Automatic classification of wheel flats based on cluster analysis.the calculations, such as non-linear activation functions and sparsity terms. Consequently,circulation. Particularly in the railway engineering field, the inclusion of this technique\nshowed a good potential to deal with variable train speeds, essentially due to the amplifying effect on the measured track dynamic responses which could induce errors in damage The application of the methodology to the data set proved to be very successful in detecting and classifying the two types of OOR damages. Damage detection was perfect, without\nany false detection. In terms of classifying the type of damage, the results are very good,\nwith a success rate of around 85%, but if only two accelerometers are considered the successrate increases to around 90%. These results are encouraging since the range of speeds considered in the analysis, between 60 and 100 km/h, is the most representative of in-service\nfreight trains. Also, the results show that including the Sparse Autoencoder has a positive\neffect in the normalization of the train speed in the damage data set.\nRegarding the severity classification for each type of damage, the methodology proved equally successful in clustering the different damage severities. For polygonal wheels, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the severity groups in terms of defect amplitude, failing only for the H6-8 harmonic cases, and in terms of harmonic orders for each amplitude,\nwith almost perfect results. For wheel flats, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the three severity groups, though with some misclassifications between the less severe group\nand baseline cases and between intermediate and severe cases. A success rate of around 86%\nis achieved in the classification of polygonal wheel severities and 84% in the classification of wheel flat severities. Even so, these high success rates of over 80% show the robustness\nof this methodology in damage classification regardless of the train speed.on on-site measurements. Additionally, this methodology could be carried out for other types of railway vehicles, for example, passenger vehicles, since the dynamic responses are\ndifferent from freight vehicles. In that case, exploring other recent types of autoencoders,\nTo increase the complexity of the problem, the objective is to explore the concept of\nmultiple damages (same or different OOR types). For this, it will be necessary to incorporate a new stage in the methodology, the damage location stage, which will make it possible\nto distinguish isolated damage from multiple damage, as well as their respective location.\nThus, damage will be identified using cut signals, which will then be used to classify theThis work is a result of project WAY4SafeRail-WAYside monitoring system FOR SAFE RAIL transportation, with reference NORTE-01-0247-FEDER-069595, co-funded by the European Regional\nDevelopment Fund (ERDF), through the North Portugal Regional Operational Programme\nPartnership Agreement.

Within this context,\nan unsupervised methodology based on artificial intelligence techniques is presented, which allows the detection and classification of wheels, based on dynamic responses induced on the track by crossing freight railway vehicles. The methodology involves the following\nsteps: (i) data collection and pre-processing, (ii) feature extraction (iii)\ndata fusion and (iv) feature discrimination. In the first phase, an FFT\nalgorithm is applied to the acceleration track responses. Then, features are extracted after training a Stacked Sparse Autoencoder, in which the main features of the responses are obtained after a compression stage using an encoder network. This lower dimensional\nlayer forces the model to learn a compression of the input data. Then,\nwhich enhances the sensitivity to the damage recognition. Posteriorly, an outlier analysis is performed to distinguish a healthy wheelRail vehicle wheels are subjected to constant wear and tear due to continuous use and inadequate maintenance plans. Over time, this wear and tear can generate more significant defects, so it is extremely important to use sensing to understand when maintenance of both the track and rolling stock is required.

However, this type of system entail high costs envisaging the vehicle wheel condition monitoring, since sensors need to be installed in every vehicle in order to achieve a good representativity . On the other hand, wayside systems are a more viable solution for identifying wheel defects, since the condition of allThe most common wheel defects are known as OOR. As the name infers, this defect is related to deformations on the surface of the wheel circumference that make it not round.\nThis deformation can have many forms and different causes, leading to faults on the vehicle and on the track due to the higher dynamic force values [4–6]. The OOR damagesa function of their shape and size, vehicle characteristics and speed [7–10]. Wheel flats induce high dynamic impact loads on the railway infrastructure, which causes significant damage to both tracks and vehicles, such as broken axles, damaged rolling bearings and cracks in the wheels, rails and sleepers . Moreover, it also generates high vibrations\ntransmitted to the rolling stock, inducing significant stresses and causing damage to the In the case of polygonal wheels, the formation mechanism can be roughly classified\ninto three categories, namely, (1) initial wheel defects , (2) a natural vibration of the\nvehicle–track system and (3) thermoelastic instability . The formation mechanism is strongly contingent on the vehicle type and its operational characteristics, withof dominant harmonic orders [19–22]. For example, Tao et al. studied asymmetrical polygonal wear on metro wheels and obtained harmonic orders of 12–14, while another study by Tao et al. found that the most common harmonic order in Chinese freight trains is 18–19. Although a polygonal wheel could generate less impact on the track than a\nwheel flat, this defect can cause serious damage to the track due to resonance effects in the\nTo identify the occurrence of these OOR anomalies in train wheels, innovative\nmethodologies have been developed combining signal processing and automatic learning techniques. These methodologies are based on the extraction of damage sensitivity features, making possible the distinction between undamaged and damaged situations. Recently, many studies have shown good results in detecting OOR damages using\ndistinct approaches [24–29]. Mishra et al. concluded that a single FBG (Fiber Bragg Grating) sensor, positioned along the rail can detect the presence of wheel flats.\nLourenço et al. created an automatic algorithm for diagnosing OOR defects. The\nproposed methodology consists of isolating specific defective wheels and then identifying the severity of the damage, using only acceleration and strain data measured on\nthe track. In another study, Krummenacher et al. , proposed two machine-learningBy extracting the features, it is possible to transform the measured data into an alternative form of information where the correlation with damage is more easily observed. There are various techniques for feature extraction, the most common being CWT\n(continuous wavelet transform) [31–33], PCA (principal component analysis) ,detection of polygonal wheels on freight vehicles using CWT and ARX features, using\n6 accelerometers, 3 on each side of the railway track. Mosleh et al. introduced aflats by extracting AR features from acceleration records. Moreover, Mohammadi et al.\nadopted linear features, particularly, CWT, PCA, ARX and AR, and their research findingsin the context of wheel flat damage detection. Although these studies have demonstrated robust results in detection, they show some limitations in dealing with the non-linear effects associated with operational effects, such as the train speed. Due to the inability of these linear techniques to attenuate operation effects, the inclusion of different speeds\nFor most of these studies, a feature normalisation stage is used when it is necessary to remove the operational effects. Usually, latent variable methods are used, such as PCA or multiple linear regression (MLR) . Thus, to deal with the non-linear phenomena and reduce the large amounts of data without relying on the aforementioned methods,\nthe first artificial neural networks were created to inherently execute this task . Over the years, new and more advanced networks have been developed, with the Autoencoder\n(AE) being one of the main types. Later, Olshausen et al. proposed the creation of\nsparse coding and Ng et al. introduced a sparse penalisation term in the hidden layer,\nto acquire more compact and effective features from lower-dimensional data. For some datasets with complex relationships between characteristics, employing more than one SAE\nis necessary, which is why stacked sparse autoencoders (SSAE) are commonly used .\nNowadays, these types of AE are widely used in various scientific fields, but specifically\nfor structural engineering only a few studies are found, and most are about damage detection on bridges [45–47]. Amaral et al. , proposed an approach for detecting structural anomalies based on SAE and Shewhart’s T control chart. The characteristics extracted byin structures. In another similar study, Amaral et al. , applied the same approach to\na numerical model of a highway viaduct in Brazil reaching more than 99% of successful classifications of structural damage with the combination of SAE and Support Vector Machine. Pathirage et al. proposed a framework utilizing SAE’s potential for dimensionality reduction, which facilitated the assessment of damage detection performance on Many of these AE algorithms already performed feature classification in order to discriminate the different types of damages and severities. However, the AE methods can also be combined with other techniques commonly used to classify the data. They can be used unsupervised methods, in which the model is trained without any labels provided to the\ntraining dataset, such as k-means , self-organising maps (SOM) , isolation forest, gaussian mixture model , k-medoids and cluster analysis , or supervised\nmethods, which assume that the hierarchy of database categories is known, such as NaiveBayes classifiers , k-Nearest Neighbours classifiers , Support Vector Machinetwo types of OOR damages, flats and polygonal wheels, based on acceleration responses obtained from a virtual wayside monitoring system.

The application of sensors on both sides of theTo obtain the responses from the railway track, it is necessary to apply sensors on the track that can measure the dynamic responses of the crossing trains. As it is not always possible\nto install them due to the high costs involved, simulations have been carried out based on calibrated models of the track , vehicle and considering their dynamic interaction,\nas well as including the track irregularities. Simulations include cases with healthy wheelsTo simulate the dynamic interactions between the vehicle and the track, an in-house software VSI – Vehicle-Structure Interaction Analysis is used, which was initially developed by\nNeves et al. and later improved by Montenegro et al. .

The vehicle model integrates spring elements to simulate suspensions, mass elements to represent the mass and\ninertia at the centre of gravity of the wagon components. For the structural connection of these elements, rigid beam elements are adopted. Table 1 outlines the properties of the The Hertzian theory is applied to calculate the normal contact forces, while the USETABthe train to the track in the VSI software. Using Lagrange multipliers, this tool connects\nwheel displacements with the track nodal displacements, incorporating track irregularities and OOR profiles through a set of constraint equations. These equations are solved\nalongside equilibrium equations, forming a unified system that couples the two subsystems\n. Including the track irregularities directly in the constraint equations are beneficial since it avoids explicitly considering\nthem in the FEM model. Moreover, it also allows to include the wheel and OOR profiles as a periodic rail irregularity, simplifying the analysis. Thus, before starting the analysis, the\nVSI software imports track irregularities and OOR profiles from a MATLAB file, whichto the vertical and lateral irregularities in each rail in each respective position, and adds it to the constraint equations of the system throughout the dynamics analysis. Then, the\nsystem of dynamic equations is solved using the typical Newmark integration method.\nThe impact of track irregularity on wheel defect classification is significant, as a lower track quality tends to result in a higher likelihood of misclassification. A comprehensive\nexploration of this influence was previously undertaken by Mosleh et al. as documented in their research study . Hence, this study does not delve into the impact of track\nquality; rather, it primarily centres on the utilisation of AI-based methodologies for the detection and classification of wheel defects. For this, four different profiles are used, based\non European Standard EN 13848–2 . In this case, power spectral density (PSD) curvesFor OOR defects, several profiles are defined based on real measurements in representative profiles of the various severities. Subsequently, the structural matrices are imported\nMore details on track and train properties, including additional information on traintrack interaction, can be found in previous publications . Figure 1 shows the\nvehicle–track interaction model schematisation and some details about the train and track\nsubsystems, as well as the track irregularities and wheel-rail contact model.According to the conclusions reached in other studies with this type of damage ,\nthe most promising location of the sensors is on the rail. To reduce installation and maintenance costs, it is important to reduce the number of sensors without compromising the\nquality of the results. Therefore, based on a sensitivity analysis performed during the study,\nonly two vertical unidirectional accelerometers were used on each rail, 4 in total (A1 to A4),\nsince they provided a higher cost–benefit ratio. These sensors are mounted on the rail atdefects, different simulation scenarios with perfect wheels (baseline) and OOR wheels\n(damage) were defined for a five-wagon Laagrss freight train. Based on different crossing speeds, loading schemes and rail irregularities profiles, 120 baseline and 180 damage scenarios (90 for polygonal wheels and 90 for wheel flats) were defined, as summarised in For baseline scenarios, six loading schemes with five different speeds (40, 60, 80, 100\nand 120 km/h) and four rail irregularity profiles were considered, giving a total of 120 scenarios. The loading schemes used are: empty, half-loaded, full-loaded and, additionally,For the damage cases, a total of 90 scenarios were generated for polygonal wheels. These\nscenarios including 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (H1, H2 and H3) x 10 different irregularity profiles within each specified harmonic interval. In these 10 irregularity\nprofiles, based on the defect amplitude, two amplitudes are considered, five simulations for\nA1 and five simulations for A2. Similarly, 90 scenarios were created for wheel flats, involving 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (F1, F2 and F3) x 10 different irregularitywheel radius . This wave phenomenon can be characterised by the different wavelengths formed (harmonics θ ), and by the levels of irregularity ( Lw ) associated with each of the harmonics. According to Peng , it is considered a polygonal wheel when the wear amplitude assumes values above 0. mm and wavelengths between 140 mm and the wheelTo define scenarios with polygonal wheels for the Laagrss wagon, a literature survey on\nexperimental measurements in defective wheels was conducted . Three experimental irregularity profiles were collected, illustrated in Figure 3. The first group (H6-8)\ncorresponds to a study carried out by Cai et al. with dominant harmonics from 6 to 8;**Figure 3.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) of polygonal wheels with**Figure 4.** Examples of polygonal damage profiles for each of the dominant harmonic intervals.the second group (H12-14) to a study authored by Tao et al. with dominant harmonics from 12 to 14; and the third profile (H17-18) to a study performed by Wu et al. with\nBased on the wheel irregularity spectra ( Lw ) taken from the respective measurement profiles, shown in Figure 3, and considering the contribution of the first 30 harmonics, several irregularity profiles were generated, according to Figure 4.

A less severe group, with a 10–20 mm length, an intermediate group, with a 25–50 mm length and a more severe case, with a 55–100 mm length. The irregularity profiles are generated randomly, but in this case, in function of two geometric\nvariables, the length and the depth of the flat. More details about the process of generation of flat profiles can be found in the study performed by Mosleh et al .

The sampling frequency for data acquisition is considered 10 kHz in order to ensure a good problem Figure 6a) shows two baseline cases for two speeds (40 and 100 km/h), where it is possible to observe the influence of speed on the dynamic response. The amplifying effect\nof speed can influence the identification of damage, which is why a robust baseline with a wide range of scenarios is very important. At a speed of 40 km/h, lower accelerations\naround 0. m/s⊃2 are observed. In contrast, at a speed of 100 km/h (considerably higher),\naccelerations increase substantially to around 3. m/s⊃2. This illustrates the significant**Figure 6.** Acceleration time-series in sensor A1 for Laagrss vehicle: (a) influence of speed, (b) influencehigher speeds.

After obtaining the acceleration measurements from the numerical simulations, an FFT algorithm is applied to the time series allowing the conversion of the signal from the time domain to the frequency domain. Then,predefined hyperparameters of the algorithm. The set hyperparameters are encoding and\ndecoding transfer functions, hidden layer size, maximum number of epochs, L2 weight regularisation term, sparsity regularisation term and a sparsity proportion term. Afterwards,**Figure 7.** Flowchart with the main phases of the methodology for detection and classification of OORthe features are extracted in the more compressed layer of the SAE, the so-called bottleneck layer. The number of features obtained is equal to the number of hidden layers which\nis usually considerably lower than the data size, allowing a compression of the input data.\nFurthermore, to enhance the sensitivity to damage, two levels of data fusion are applied to the bottleneck features using the Mahalanobis distance. In the first level, all features are\nfused into a damage index (DI) for each sensor and, in the second level, all the sensors\nare merged resulting in only one DI for each simulation. Finally, automatic damage detection is achieved by performing an outlier analysis, in which a statistical confidence limit\n(CB) is used, based on the Inverse Cumulative Gaussian Distribution Function (ICDF).\nFor feature classification, an automatic clustering process based on the k-means technique is implemented. This algorithm allows for the unsupervised and automatic classification of data, based on the calculation of statistical distances between objects. In k-means technique given a vector of data and chosen k clusters, the key is to find k centroids that minimise\nthe distance of each vector to its nearest centroid . Since it is necessary to define the number of clusters in advance, a global Silhouette index (SIL) was adopted to make\nan automatic process. At the end, the clusters will allow the classification of the two typesbetween the number of correct classifications and the total number of cases.damage detection problems, as it allows a signal to be converted from the time domain to the frequency domain, to capture the excitation frequencies induced by the wheel defects.\nIn addition, a data reduction is carried out at this stage, since the initial records contain aa crossing speed of 80 km/h. When comparing the FFT spectra for a train passage with flats, Figure 8a), with polygonal wheels, Figure 8b), there are visible differences in terms\nof amplitude peak values and excited frequency ranges. For flats, the amplitude peak values are higher and they induce frequencies in the range between DC and 1500accordance with some authors reports . In terms of severities, for flats, the more severe group (55–100 mm) is the one with the higher frequency content, as expected,a baseline response. For polygonal wheels, from the analysis of Figure 8b), it can be seen the frequency peaks for the H12–14 and H17–18 profiles around 100 and 150\nrespectively, while for the profile H6-8 a more flat spectrum is obtained without showing any significant peak. This can be explained by the irregularity level profile of thisThese two graphs can show which frequencies have higher content in the original signal.Autoencoders are artificial neural networks trained using an unsupervised approach,\nwhich aim first to learn coded representations of the data, compressing the input into\na latent space representation, and second, through this compressed information, reconstructing the information. The basic architecture of this type of network consists of threewhere **Wij**, **Wjk** are the weights connection matrices between input layer-hidden\nlayer and hidden layer-output layer, **X** = ( **X** 1, **X** 2, . . ., **Xn** ) is the input data vector,\n**H** = ( **H** 1, . . ., **Hm** ) is the low-dimensional vector and **X** [ˆ] = ( **X** [ˆ] 1, **X** [ˆ] 2, . . ., **X** [ˆ] **n** ) is the output**Figure 8.** Frequency domain responses on position 1 for the crossing speed of 80 km/h: (a) wheel flats,data vector. **b** 1, **b** 2 are bias vectors and σ 1, σ 2 are the activation function used in each of thereconstruction of the input X [ˆ], as shown in Equation (3). This function uses the meanIn the Sparse Autoencoder, to make the coding more efficient, two regularisation terms,\nsparse penalty term and weight regularisation term, are added to the error function, causing only a subset of neurons to be activated. The average activation of neurons in the hiddenAs the average activation ˆ ρ is intended to be close to a constant ρ (sparsity proportion)\nand it is usually a small positive number near 0, the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence isIn addition to this, a weight regularisation term, called L2 regularisation, is also addedwhere L is the number of hidden layers, nl the output size of layer l, kl the input size ofwhere μ is the coefficient for the L2 regularisation term and β the coefficient for the sparsityAfter data pre-processing, the acceleration responses in the frequency domain, are then In this work, two layers of SAE’s were used to form the network, as shown in Figure 9.layers, with the outputs of the previous autoencoder serving as input for the next one. After incorporating various inputs into the SSAE training, they are integrated into the so-called\n‘Input 1’. As training progresses, the data is compressed, and the main characteristics of the signals are obtained and retained in ‘Bottleneck 1’. Subsequently, these characteristics are\nused as input for training the second sparse autoencoder, which, after further compression,\nenables the extraction of the final features. Depending on the type of data under analysis,\nthe compression level differs, so multiple tests should be conducted to optimise these layer sizes. This optimisation was achieved by trial and test, changing both the size of the first\nIt should be noted that this network architecture, where the dimensions of the layers gradually decrease along the network until reaching the bottleneck layer , has proven\nto be highly robust for the type of data used. It allows for effective compression of results**Figure 9.** Schematic of the structure of the SSAE neural network used in this study.After extracting the features from the bottleneck layer of the SSAE, the difference between the healthy wheels scenarios and the damage wheels scenarios is still not sufficient. Hence\na data fusion is performed. With this fusion, it is possible to increase the sensitivity of the\nfeatures, and as a result, to obtain a damage index (DI) for each simulation. Thus, the Mahalanobis distance (MD) is used to reduce the volume of extracted data and preserve the most relevant information . Briefly, MD is a metric that measures the distance between two points in a feature space consisting of two or more variables, being independent of the\nscale of the features, thus allowing an increase in the sensitivity of the features to cases with damage. The MD, denoted here as DI, is calculated for each simulation using the followingin which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−], and ¯ x is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The MD is calculated for each sensor and for each simulation, obtaining a matrix of n distances per k number of sensors.Finally, the discrimination of the features consists in distinguishing the features as corresponding to a healthy or damaged case. At this stage of the methodology, an analysis of\nabnormal values is carried out, which will allow the condition of the train wheels to beautomatically monitored and these values to be classified into different classes. This phaseThe outlier analysis consists of grouping, by probabilistic distribution processes, the datato the previously created group. For this, a statistical confidence limit (CB) is used, based on the inverse cumulative Gaussian distribution function (ICDF), considering the mean\nvalue, ¯ μ, and standard deviation, σ, of the baseline feature vector.Whenever a value of a DI indicator is equal to or greater than CB, it is considered an outlier (the null hypothesis is rejected), thus representing a case of damage.For feature classification, a clustering process is used to divide the dataset into distinct clusters that should be as compact and separated as possible . For clustering, the k-meanson the distances of their vectors. Recent studies showed that the k-means algorithm has shown promising results . The main limitation of this technique is that it requires\nknowledge of the number of clusters in advance. For this purpose, the global silhouetteThis section presents the main results obtained through the application of the methodology proposed in section 3 to the calculated track responses. The methodology is applied using damaged wheel passages for the three simulated train speeds (60, 80 and 100 km/h),hyperparameters (presented in section 3). By adjusting these hyperparameters, it is possible to make the algorithm more efficient and improve the generalisation capabilities, as only\nthe most important features are retained. The optimisation of these hyperparameters isof data under analysis. Based on the principles of the SAE already outlined in other works\nIn the context of this study, the non-linear transfer functions (logsig) proved to be more effective than the linear ones, being the ones used in all the studied cases. After analysing Table 3, there is a similarity in the hyperparameters when comparing the two types of OOR damage. It is observed that the data compression level is the same for both cases, around\n93%, as 500 features are extracted in Bottleneck 2 from the initial input data with 7000\nConcerning the type of damage situation, the size of the ‘Bottleneck 1’ and ‘Bottleneck\n2’ was increased to bring them even closer to the initial amount of input data. This can beanalysis, making it challenging for the autoencoder to define relationships between the data, hence requiring a larger number. On the contrary, the maximum number of epochsIt is also important to emphasise that of the various hyperparameters presented, theOnce the hyperparameters have been defined, all the steps of the methodology are applied to the new dataset. For simplicity, in this section, only the last phase of the methodology will be presented, namely an outlier analysis for damage detection and cluster analysis for damage classification. For each sensor, a matrix n × m is created, where n\nis the number of test passages (baseline scenarios + damage scenarios), and m represents the number of extracted features. So, the size of the matrices is 210 × 2000 in case of the\ntype of damage, 75 × 500 for each amplitude in polygonal wheel, and 120 × 500 for wheelDespite the visual distinction between healthy and damaged wheels based on the data processing presented in subsection 3.2, unsupervised learning must use strategies capable of automatically detecting damage. To this end, an outlier analysis is employed, which consists of defining a confidence threshold using a significance level of 1% , represented**Figure 10.** Automatic OOR damage detection based on outlier analysis.by the green line in Figure 10. This approach makes it possible to successfully detect allTo distinguish the two types of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed. Figure 11\nshows a clear distinction between the damage, even when using a dataset with three different train speeds (60,80 and 100 km/h).. In the case of Figure 11a), using all four\naccelerometers, it is possible to efficiently separate the set into two large clusters, despite\n30 misclassifications (16 in the polygonisation and 14 in the flats). Even so, the accuracy\npercentage is around 85%, which is a very good result. To analyse the sensitivity to the number of sensors, only two sensors were used, one on each side ). The results\nimproved, with a decrease in the number of misclassifications from 30 to 21 (13 for polygonisation and 8 for flats). One explanation could be the disparity in sensor sensitivity to the damage, where some sensors are more sensitive than others due to their spatial positioning in relation to the damage. By merging the data from the less sensitive sensors with the\nmore sensitive ones, this could have a negative impact on the results. Thus, the percentage\nThe purpose behind presenting these two plots was to demonstrate that, whether using 4 sensors or 2 sensors, the classification remains remarkably robust, showing lowAfter identifying the type of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed once again to\nclassify the severity of each damage separately. Regarding polygonal wheels, the classification involves both amplitude and harmonic orders, leading to the clusters depicted in the obtained clusters reasonably reflect the two amplitude groups, with all misclassifications associated with the H6-8 harmonic cases (17 misclassifications). Once the amplitude\nis identified, harmonic classification must be carried out separately for each of the amplitudes. In Figure 12b), related to amplitude A1, it is observed that the obtained clusters**Figure 11.** Automatic OOR damage classification based on cluster analysis using: a) 4 sensors; b) 2are nearly perfect, with only 3 misclassifications. In Figure 12c), there are only 3 misclassifications, totalling 8 misclassifications in the classification of the number of dominant\nThe classification of harmonic order is only possible with the separation of amplitudes,\nFigure 13 presents the clusters obtained for the wheel flat cases. The separation between\nthe less severe group and baseline cases and intermediate (cluster 3) and severe cases (cluster 4) is reduced, resulting in a total of 19 misclassifications. Nevertheless, this result showsrate of about 84%. One possible reason for this significant number of misclassifications could be directly associated with the number of impacts captured by the sensor.In order to contribute to the safety of railway transportation and service quality, an automatic methodology based on machine learning has been proposed. This methodology can accurately detect and classify two types of OOR wheel damage in railway vehicles allowing to mitigate problems at both track and vehicle level, such as derailments or material\ndegradation. It includes a new technique for feature extraction based on a dedicated neural network, the Sparse Autoencoder. This non-linear technique is an upgrade concerning the commonly used linear techniques for feature extraction since it allows a better normalisation of the operational effects in the analysed data, as well as the reduction of large amounts\nof data without relying on other techniques, while keeping the most valuable information. These improvements are achieved through the use of different hyperparameters in**Figure 12.** Automatic classification of polygonal wheels based on cluster analysis: a) amplitude A1-A2;**Figure 13.** Automatic classification of wheel flats based on cluster analysis.the calculations, such as non-linear activation functions and sparsity terms. Consequently,circulation. Particularly in the railway engineering field, the inclusion of this technique\nshowed a good potential to deal with variable train speeds, essentially due to the amplifying effect on the measured track dynamic responses which could induce errors in damage The application of the methodology to the data set proved to be very successful in detecting and classifying the two types of OOR damages. Damage detection was perfect, without\nany false detection. In terms of classifying the type of damage, the results are very good,\nwith a success rate of around 85%, but if only two accelerometers are considered the successrate increases to around 90%. These results are encouraging since the range of speeds considered in the analysis, between 60 and 100 km/h, is the most representative of in-service\nfreight trains. Also, the results show that including the Sparse Autoencoder has a positive\neffect in the normalization of the train speed in the damage data set.\nRegarding the severity classification for each type of damage, the methodology proved equally successful in clustering the different damage severities. For polygonal wheels, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the severity groups in terms of defect amplitude, failing only for the H6-8 harmonic cases, and in terms of harmonic orders for each amplitude,\nwith almost perfect results. For wheel flats, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the three severity groups, though with some misclassifications between the less severe group\nand baseline cases and between intermediate and severe cases. A success rate of around 86%\nis achieved in the classification of polygonal wheel severities and 84% in the classification of wheel flat severities. Even so, these high success rates of over 80% show the robustness\nof this methodology in damage classification regardless of the train speed.on on-site measurements. Additionally, this methodology could be carried out for other types of railway vehicles, for example, passenger vehicles, since the dynamic responses are\ndifferent from freight vehicles. In that case, exploring other recent types of autoencoders,\nTo increase the complexity of the problem, the objective is to explore the concept of\nmultiple damages (same or different OOR types). For this, it will be necessary to incorporate a new stage in the methodology, the damage location stage, which will make it possible\nto distinguish isolated damage from multiple damage, as well as their respective location.\nThus, damage will be identified using cut signals, which will then be used to classify theThis work is a result of project WAY4SafeRail-WAYside monitoring system FOR SAFE RAIL transportation, with reference NORTE-01-0247-FEDER-069595, co-funded by the European Regional\nDevelopment Fund (ERDF), through the North Portugal Regional Operational Programme\nPartnership Agreement.

Within this context,\nan unsupervised methodology based on artificial intelligence techniques is presented, which allows the detection and classification of wheels, based on dynamic responses induced on the track by crossing freight railway vehicles. The methodology involves the following\nsteps: (i) data collection and pre-processing, (ii) feature extraction (iii)\ndata fusion and (iv) feature discrimination. In the first phase, an FFT\nalgorithm is applied to the acceleration track responses. Then, features are extracted after training a Stacked Sparse Autoencoder, in which the main features of the responses are obtained after a compression stage using an encoder network. This lower dimensional\nlayer forces the model to learn a compression of the input data. Then,\nwhich enhances the sensitivity to the damage recognition. Posteriorly, an outlier analysis is performed to distinguish a healthy wheelRail vehicle wheels are subjected to constant wear and tear due to continuous use and inadequate maintenance plans. Over time, this wear and tear can generate more significant defects, so it is extremely important to use sensing to understand when maintenance of both the track and rolling stock is required.

However, this type of system entail high costs envisaging the vehicle wheel condition monitoring, since sensors need to be installed in every vehicle in order to achieve a good representativity . On the other hand, wayside systems are a more viable solution for identifying wheel defects, since the condition of allThe most common wheel defects are known as OOR. As the name infers, this defect is related to deformations on the surface of the wheel circumference that make it not round.\nThis deformation can have many forms and different causes, leading to faults on the vehicle and on the track due to the higher dynamic force values [4–6]. The OOR damagesa function of their shape and size, vehicle characteristics and speed [7–10]. Wheel flats induce high dynamic impact loads on the railway infrastructure, which causes significant damage to both tracks and vehicles, such as broken axles, damaged rolling bearings and cracks in the wheels, rails and sleepers . Moreover, it also generates high vibrations\ntransmitted to the rolling stock, inducing significant stresses and causing damage to the In the case of polygonal wheels, the formation mechanism can be roughly classified\ninto three categories, namely, (1) initial wheel defects , (2) a natural vibration of the\nvehicle–track system and (3) thermoelastic instability . The formation mechanism is strongly contingent on the vehicle type and its operational characteristics, withof dominant harmonic orders [19–22]. For example, Tao et al. studied asymmetrical polygonal wear on metro wheels and obtained harmonic orders of 12–14, while another study by Tao et al. found that the most common harmonic order in Chinese freight trains is 18–19. Although a polygonal wheel could generate less impact on the track than a\nwheel flat, this defect can cause serious damage to the track due to resonance effects in the\nTo identify the occurrence of these OOR anomalies in train wheels, innovative\nmethodologies have been developed combining signal processing and automatic learning techniques. These methodologies are based on the extraction of damage sensitivity features, making possible the distinction between undamaged and damaged situations. Recently, many studies have shown good results in detecting OOR damages using\ndistinct approaches [24–29]. Mishra et al. concluded that a single FBG (Fiber Bragg Grating) sensor, positioned along the rail can detect the presence of wheel flats.\nLourenço et al. created an automatic algorithm for diagnosing OOR defects. The\nproposed methodology consists of isolating specific defective wheels and then identifying the severity of the damage, using only acceleration and strain data measured on\nthe track. In another study, Krummenacher et al. , proposed two machine-learningBy extracting the features, it is possible to transform the measured data into an alternative form of information where the correlation with damage is more easily observed. There are various techniques for feature extraction, the most common being CWT\n(continuous wavelet transform) [31–33], PCA (principal component analysis) ,detection of polygonal wheels on freight vehicles using CWT and ARX features, using\n6 accelerometers, 3 on each side of the railway track. Mosleh et al. introduced aflats by extracting AR features from acceleration records. Moreover, Mohammadi et al.\nadopted linear features, particularly, CWT, PCA, ARX and AR, and their research findingsin the context of wheel flat damage detection. Although these studies have demonstrated robust results in detection, they show some limitations in dealing with the non-linear effects associated with operational effects, such as the train speed. Due to the inability of these linear techniques to attenuate operation effects, the inclusion of different speeds\nFor most of these studies, a feature normalisation stage is used when it is necessary to remove the operational effects. Usually, latent variable methods are used, such as PCA or multiple linear regression (MLR) . Thus, to deal with the non-linear phenomena and reduce the large amounts of data without relying on the aforementioned methods,\nthe first artificial neural networks were created to inherently execute this task . Over the years, new and more advanced networks have been developed, with the Autoencoder\n(AE) being one of the main types. Later, Olshausen et al. proposed the creation of\nsparse coding and Ng et al. introduced a sparse penalisation term in the hidden layer,\nto acquire more compact and effective features from lower-dimensional data. For some datasets with complex relationships between characteristics, employing more than one SAE\nis necessary, which is why stacked sparse autoencoders (SSAE) are commonly used .\nNowadays, these types of AE are widely used in various scientific fields, but specifically\nfor structural engineering only a few studies are found, and most are about damage detection on bridges [45–47].

Pathirage et al. proposed a framework utilizing SAE’s potential for dimensionality reduction, which facilitated the assessment of damage detection performance on Many of these AE algorithms already performed feature classification in order to discriminate the different types of damages and severities. However, the AE methods can also be combined with other techniques commonly used to classify the data. They can be used unsupervised methods, in which the model is trained without any labels provided to the\ntraining dataset, such as k-means , self-organising maps (SOM) , isolation forest, gaussian mixture model , k-medoids and cluster analysis , or supervised\nmethods, which assume that the hierarchy of database categories is known, such as NaiveBayes classifiers , k-Nearest Neighbours classifiers , Support Vector Machinetwo types of OOR damages, flats and polygonal wheels, based on acceleration responses obtained from a virtual wayside monitoring system.

The application of sensors on both sides of theTo obtain the responses from the railway track, it is necessary to apply sensors on the track that can measure the dynamic responses of the crossing trains. As it is not always possible\nto install them due to the high costs involved, simulations have been carried out based on calibrated models of the track , vehicle and considering their dynamic interaction,\nas well as including the track irregularities. Simulations include cases with healthy wheelsTo simulate the dynamic interactions between the vehicle and the track, an in-house software VSI – Vehicle-Structure Interaction Analysis is used, which was initially developed by\nNeves et al. and later improved by Montenegro et al. .

Including the track irregularities directly in the constraint equations are beneficial since it avoids explicitly considering\nthem in the FEM model. Moreover, it also allows to include the wheel and OOR profiles as a periodic rail irregularity, simplifying the analysis. Thus, before starting the analysis, the\nVSI software imports track irregularities and OOR profiles from a MATLAB file, whichto the vertical and lateral irregularities in each rail in each respective position, and adds it to the constraint equations of the system throughout the dynamics analysis. Then, the\nsystem of dynamic equations is solved using the typical Newmark integration method.\nThe impact of track irregularity on wheel defect classification is significant, as a lower track quality tends to result in a higher likelihood of misclassification. A comprehensive\nexploration of this influence was previously undertaken by Mosleh et al. as documented in their research study . Hence, this study does not delve into the impact of track\nquality; rather, it primarily centres on the utilisation of AI-based methodologies for the detection and classification of wheel defects. For this, four different profiles are used, based\non European Standard EN 13848–2 . In this case, power spectral density (PSD) curvesFor OOR defects, several profiles are defined based on real measurements in representative profiles of the various severities. Subsequently, the structural matrices are imported\nMore details on track and train properties, including additional information on traintrack interaction, can be found in previous publications . Figure 1 shows the\nvehicle–track interaction model schematisation and some details about the train and track\nsubsystems, as well as the track irregularities and wheel-rail contact model.According to the conclusions reached in other studies with this type of damage ,\nthe most promising location of the sensors is on the rail. To reduce installation and maintenance costs, it is important to reduce the number of sensors without compromising the\nquality of the results. Therefore, based on a sensitivity analysis performed during the study,\nonly two vertical unidirectional accelerometers were used on each rail, 4 in total (A1 to A4),\nsince they provided a higher cost–benefit ratio. These sensors are mounted on the rail atdefects, different simulation scenarios with perfect wheels (baseline) and OOR wheels\n(damage) were defined for a five-wagon Laagrss freight train. Based on different crossing speeds, loading schemes and rail irregularities profiles, 120 baseline and 180 damage scenarios (90 for polygonal wheels and 90 for wheel flats) were defined, as summarised in For baseline scenarios, six loading schemes with five different speeds (40, 60, 80, 100\nand 120 km/h) and four rail irregularity profiles were considered, giving a total of 120 scenarios. The loading schemes used are: empty, half-loaded, full-loaded and, additionally,For the damage cases, a total of 90 scenarios were generated for polygonal wheels. These\nscenarios including 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (H1, H2 and H3) x 10 different irregularity profiles within each specified harmonic interval. In these 10 irregularity\nprofiles, based on the defect amplitude, two amplitudes are considered, five simulations for\nA1 and five simulations for A2. Similarly, 90 scenarios were created for wheel flats, involving 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (F1, F2 and F3) x 10 different irregularitywheel radius . This wave phenomenon can be characterised by the different wavelengths formed (harmonics θ ), and by the levels of irregularity ( Lw ) associated with each of the harmonics. According to Peng , it is considered a polygonal wheel when the wear amplitude assumes values above 0. mm and wavelengths between 140 mm and the wheelTo define scenarios with polygonal wheels for the Laagrss wagon, a literature survey on\nexperimental measurements in defective wheels was conducted . Three experimental irregularity profiles were collected, illustrated in Figure 3. The first group (H6-8)\ncorresponds to a study carried out by Cai et al. with dominant harmonics from 6 to 8;**Figure 3.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) of polygonal wheels with**Figure 4.** Examples of polygonal damage profiles for each of the dominant harmonic intervals.the second group (H12-14) to a study authored by Tao et al. with dominant harmonics from 12 to 14; and the third profile (H17-18) to a study performed by Wu et al. with\nBased on the wheel irregularity spectra ( Lw ) taken from the respective measurement profiles, shown in Figure 3, and considering the contribution of the first 30 harmonics, several irregularity profiles were generated, according to Figure 4.

Lastly, Figure 6c) and d), show two acceleration responses for the two types of simulated OOR damages. Compared to a perfect wheel, there is a significant increase of the peak values, more localised in the case of flats ) and more distributed in thethe wheel condition is based on Machine Learning (ML) and comprises several phases,\nsummarised in the flowchart presented in Figure 7. After obtaining the acceleration measurements from the numerical simulations, an FFT algorithm is applied to the time series allowing the conversion of the signal from the time domain to the frequency domain. Then,predefined hyperparameters of the algorithm. The set hyperparameters are encoding and\ndecoding transfer functions, hidden layer size, maximum number of epochs, L2 weight regularisation term, sparsity regularisation term and a sparsity proportion term. Afterwards,**Figure 7.** Flowchart with the main phases of the methodology for detection and classification of OORthe features are extracted in the more compressed layer of the SAE, the so-called bottleneck layer. The number of features obtained is equal to the number of hidden layers which\nis usually considerably lower than the data size, allowing a compression of the input data.\nFurthermore, to enhance the sensitivity to damage, two levels of data fusion are applied to the bottleneck features using the Mahalanobis distance. In the first level, all features are\nfused into a damage index (DI) for each sensor and, in the second level, all the sensors\nare merged resulting in only one DI for each simulation. Finally, automatic damage detection is achieved by performing an outlier analysis, in which a statistical confidence limit\n(CB) is used, based on the Inverse Cumulative Gaussian Distribution Function (ICDF).\nFor feature classification, an automatic clustering process based on the k-means technique is implemented. This algorithm allows for the unsupervised and automatic classification of data, based on the calculation of statistical distances between objects. In k-means technique given a vector of data and chosen k clusters, the key is to find k centroids that minimise\nthe distance of each vector to its nearest centroid . Since it is necessary to define the number of clusters in advance, a global Silhouette index (SIL) was adopted to make\nan automatic process. At the end, the clusters will allow the classification of the two typesbetween the number of correct classifications and the total number of cases.damage detection problems, as it allows a signal to be converted from the time domain to the frequency domain, to capture the excitation frequencies induced by the wheel defects.\nIn addition, a data reduction is carried out at this stage, since the initial records contain aa crossing speed of 80 km/h. When comparing the FFT spectra for a train passage with flats, Figure 8a), with polygonal wheels, Figure 8b), there are visible differences in terms\nof amplitude peak values and excited frequency ranges. For flats, the amplitude peak values are higher and they induce frequencies in the range between DC and 1500accordance with some authors reports . In terms of severities, for flats, the more severe group (55–100 mm) is the one with the higher frequency content, as expected,a baseline response. For polygonal wheels, from the analysis of Figure 8b), it can be seen the frequency peaks for the H12–14 and H17–18 profiles around 100 and 150\nrespectively, while for the profile H6-8 a more flat spectrum is obtained without showing any significant peak. This can be explained by the irregularity level profile of thisThese two graphs can show which frequencies have higher content in the original signal.Autoencoders are artificial neural networks trained using an unsupervised approach,\nwhich aim first to learn coded representations of the data, compressing the input into\na latent space representation, and second, through this compressed information, reconstructing the information. The basic architecture of this type of network consists of threewhere **Wij**, **Wjk** are the weights connection matrices between input layer-hidden\nlayer and hidden layer-output layer, **X** = ( **X** 1, **X** 2, . . ., **Xn** ) is the input data vector,\n**H** = ( **H** 1, . . ., **Hm** ) is the low-dimensional vector and **X** [ˆ] = ( **X** [ˆ] 1, **X** [ˆ] 2, . . ., **X** [ˆ] **n** ) is the output**Figure 8.** Frequency domain responses on position 1 for the crossing speed of 80 km/h: (a) wheel flats,data vector. **b** 1, **b** 2 are bias vectors and σ 1, σ 2 are the activation function used in each of thereconstruction of the input X [ˆ], as shown in Equation (3). This function uses the meanIn the Sparse Autoencoder, to make the coding more efficient, two regularisation terms,\nsparse penalty term and weight regularisation term, are added to the error function, causing only a subset of neurons to be activated. The average activation of neurons in the hiddenAs the average activation ˆ ρ is intended to be close to a constant ρ (sparsity proportion)\nand it is usually a small positive number near 0, the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence isIn addition to this, a weight regularisation term, called L2 regularisation, is also addedwhere L is the number of hidden layers, nl the output size of layer l, kl the input size ofwhere μ is the coefficient for the L2 regularisation term and β the coefficient for the sparsityAfter data pre-processing, the acceleration responses in the frequency domain, are then In this work, two layers of SAE’s were used to form the network, as shown in Figure 9.layers, with the outputs of the previous autoencoder serving as input for the next one. After incorporating various inputs into the SSAE training, they are integrated into the so-called\n‘Input 1’. As training progresses, the data is compressed, and the main characteristics of the signals are obtained and retained in ‘Bottleneck 1’. Subsequently, these characteristics are\nused as input for training the second sparse autoencoder, which, after further compression,\nenables the extraction of the final features. Depending on the type of data under analysis,\nthe compression level differs, so multiple tests should be conducted to optimise these layer sizes. This optimisation was achieved by trial and test, changing both the size of the first\nIt should be noted that this network architecture, where the dimensions of the layers gradually decrease along the network until reaching the bottleneck layer , has proven\nto be highly robust for the type of data used. It allows for effective compression of results**Figure 9.** Schematic of the structure of the SSAE neural network used in this study.After extracting the features from the bottleneck layer of the SSAE, the difference between the healthy wheels scenarios and the damage wheels scenarios is still not sufficient. Hence\na data fusion is performed. With this fusion, it is possible to increase the sensitivity of the\nfeatures, and as a result, to obtain a damage index (DI) for each simulation. Thus, the Mahalanobis distance (MD) is used to reduce the volume of extracted data and preserve the most relevant information . Briefly, MD is a metric that measures the distance between two points in a feature space consisting of two or more variables, being independent of the\nscale of the features, thus allowing an increase in the sensitivity of the features to cases with damage. The MD, denoted here as DI, is calculated for each simulation using the followingin which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−], and ¯ x is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The MD is calculated for each sensor and for each simulation, obtaining a matrix of n distances per k number of sensors.Finally, the discrimination of the features consists in distinguishing the features as corresponding to a healthy or damaged case. At this stage of the methodology, an analysis of\nabnormal values is carried out, which will allow the condition of the train wheels to beautomatically monitored and these values to be classified into different classes. This phaseThe outlier analysis consists of grouping, by probabilistic distribution processes, the datato the previously created group. For this, a statistical confidence limit (CB) is used, based on the inverse cumulative Gaussian distribution function (ICDF), considering the mean\nvalue, ¯ μ, and standard deviation, σ, of the baseline feature vector.Whenever a value of a DI indicator is equal to or greater than CB, it is considered an outlier (the null hypothesis is rejected), thus representing a case of damage.For feature classification, a clustering process is used to divide the dataset into distinct clusters that should be as compact and separated as possible . For clustering, the k-meanson the distances of their vectors. Recent studies showed that the k-means algorithm has shown promising results . The main limitation of this technique is that it requires\nknowledge of the number of clusters in advance. For this purpose, the global silhouetteThis section presents the main results obtained through the application of the methodology proposed in section 3 to the calculated track responses. The methodology is applied using damaged wheel passages for the three simulated train speeds (60, 80 and 100 km/h),hyperparameters (presented in section 3). By adjusting these hyperparameters, it is possible to make the algorithm more efficient and improve the generalisation capabilities, as only\nthe most important features are retained. The optimisation of these hyperparameters isof data under analysis. Based on the principles of the SAE already outlined in other works\nIn the context of this study, the non-linear transfer functions (logsig) proved to be more effective than the linear ones, being the ones used in all the studied cases. After analysing Table 3, there is a similarity in the hyperparameters when comparing the two types of OOR damage. It is observed that the data compression level is the same for both cases, around\n93%, as 500 features are extracted in Bottleneck 2 from the initial input data with 7000\nConcerning the type of damage situation, the size of the ‘Bottleneck 1’ and ‘Bottleneck\n2’ was increased to bring them even closer to the initial amount of input data. This can beanalysis, making it challenging for the autoencoder to define relationships between the data, hence requiring a larger number. On the contrary, the maximum number of epochsIt is also important to emphasise that of the various hyperparameters presented, theOnce the hyperparameters have been defined, all the steps of the methodology are applied to the new dataset. For simplicity, in this section, only the last phase of the methodology will be presented, namely an outlier analysis for damage detection and cluster analysis for damage classification. For each sensor, a matrix n × m is created, where n\nis the number of test passages (baseline scenarios + damage scenarios), and m represents the number of extracted features. So, the size of the matrices is 210 × 2000 in case of the\ntype of damage, 75 × 500 for each amplitude in polygonal wheel, and 120 × 500 for wheelDespite the visual distinction between healthy and damaged wheels based on the data processing presented in subsection 3.2, unsupervised learning must use strategies capable of automatically detecting damage. To this end, an outlier analysis is employed, which consists of defining a confidence threshold using a significance level of 1% , represented**Figure 10.** Automatic OOR damage detection based on outlier analysis.by the green line in Figure 10. This approach makes it possible to successfully detect allTo distinguish the two types of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed. Figure 11\nshows a clear distinction between the damage, even when using a dataset with three different train speeds (60,80 and 100 km/h).. In the case of Figure 11a), using all four\naccelerometers, it is possible to efficiently separate the set into two large clusters, despite\n30 misclassifications (16 in the polygonisation and 14 in the flats). Even so, the accuracy\npercentage is around 85%, which is a very good result. To analyse the sensitivity to the number of sensors, only two sensors were used, one on each side ). The results\nimproved, with a decrease in the number of misclassifications from 30 to 21 (13 for polygonisation and 8 for flats). One explanation could be the disparity in sensor sensitivity to the damage, where some sensors are more sensitive than others due to their spatial positioning in relation to the damage. By merging the data from the less sensitive sensors with the\nmore sensitive ones, this could have a negative impact on the results. Thus, the percentage\nThe purpose behind presenting these two plots was to demonstrate that, whether using 4 sensors or 2 sensors, the classification remains remarkably robust, showing lowAfter identifying the type of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed once again to\nclassify the severity of each damage separately. Regarding polygonal wheels, the classification involves both amplitude and harmonic orders, leading to the clusters depicted in the obtained clusters reasonably reflect the two amplitude groups, with all misclassifications associated with the H6-8 harmonic cases (17 misclassifications). Once the amplitude\nis identified, harmonic classification must be carried out separately for each of the amplitudes. In Figure 12b), related to amplitude A1, it is observed that the obtained clusters**Figure 11.** Automatic OOR damage classification based on cluster analysis using: a) 4 sensors; b) 2are nearly perfect, with only 3 misclassifications. In Figure 12c), there are only 3 misclassifications, totalling 8 misclassifications in the classification of the number of dominant\nThe classification of harmonic order is only possible with the separation of amplitudes,\nFigure 13 presents the clusters obtained for the wheel flat cases. The separation between\nthe less severe group and baseline cases and intermediate (cluster 3) and severe cases (cluster 4) is reduced, resulting in a total of 19 misclassifications. Nevertheless, this result showsrate of about 84%. One possible reason for this significant number of misclassifications could be directly associated with the number of impacts captured by the sensor.In order to contribute to the safety of railway transportation and service quality, an automatic methodology based on machine learning has been proposed. This methodology can accurately detect and classify two types of OOR wheel damage in railway vehicles allowing to mitigate problems at both track and vehicle level, such as derailments or material\ndegradation. It includes a new technique for feature extraction based on a dedicated neural network, the Sparse Autoencoder. This non-linear technique is an upgrade concerning the commonly used linear techniques for feature extraction since it allows a better normalisation of the operational effects in the analysed data, as well as the reduction of large amounts\nof data without relying on other techniques, while keeping the most valuable information. These improvements are achieved through the use of different hyperparameters in**Figure 12.** Automatic classification of polygonal wheels based on cluster analysis: a) amplitude A1-A2;**Figure 13.** Automatic classification of wheel flats based on cluster analysis.the calculations, such as non-linear activation functions and sparsity terms. Consequently,circulation. Particularly in the railway engineering field, the inclusion of this technique\nshowed a good potential to deal with variable train speeds, essentially due to the amplifying effect on the measured track dynamic responses which could induce errors in damage The application of the methodology to the data set proved to be very successful in detecting and classifying the two types of OOR damages. Damage detection was perfect, without\nany false detection. In terms of classifying the type of damage, the results are very good,\nwith a success rate of around 85%, but if only two accelerometers are considered the successrate increases to around 90%. These results are encouraging since the range of speeds considered in the analysis, between 60 and 100 km/h, is the most representative of in-service\nfreight trains. Also, the results show that including the Sparse Autoencoder has a positive\neffect in the normalization of the train speed in the damage data set.\nRegarding the severity classification for each type of damage, the methodology proved equally successful in clustering the different damage severities. For polygonal wheels, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the severity groups in terms of defect amplitude, failing only for the H6-8 harmonic cases, and in terms of harmonic orders for each amplitude,\nwith almost perfect results. For wheel flats, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the three severity groups, though with some misclassifications between the less severe group\nand baseline cases and between intermediate and severe cases. A success rate of around 86%\nis achieved in the classification of polygonal wheel severities and 84% in the classification of wheel flat severities. Even so, these high success rates of over 80% show the robustness\nof this methodology in damage classification regardless of the train speed.on on-site measurements. Additionally, this methodology could be carried out for other types of railway vehicles, for example, passenger vehicles, since the dynamic responses are\ndifferent from freight vehicles. In that case, exploring other recent types of autoencoders,\nTo increase the complexity of the problem, the objective is to explore the concept of\nmultiple damages (same or different OOR types). For this, it will be necessary to incorporate a new stage in the methodology, the damage location stage, which will make it possible\nto distinguish isolated damage from multiple damage, as well as their respective location.\nThus, damage will be identified using cut signals, which will then be used to classify theThis work is a result of project WAY4SafeRail-WAYside monitoring system FOR SAFE RAIL transportation, with reference NORTE-01-0247-FEDER-069595, co-funded by the European Regional\nDevelopment Fund (ERDF), through the North Portugal Regional Operational Programme\nPartnership Agreement.

Within this context,\nan unsupervised methodology based on artificial intelligence techniques is presented, which allows the detection and classification of wheels, based on dynamic responses induced on the track by crossing freight railway vehicles. The methodology involves the following\nsteps: (i) data collection and pre-processing, (ii) feature extraction (iii)\ndata fusion and (iv) feature discrimination.

Over time, this wear and tear can generate more significant defects, so it is extremely important to use sensing to understand when maintenance of both the track and rolling stock is required.

However, this type of system entail high costs envisaging the vehicle wheel condition monitoring, since sensors need to be installed in every vehicle in order to achieve a good representativity . On the other hand, wayside systems are a more viable solution for identifying wheel defects, since the condition of allThe most common wheel defects are known as OOR. As the name infers, this defect is related to deformations on the surface of the wheel circumference that make it not round.\nThis deformation can have many forms and different causes, leading to faults on the vehicle and on the track due to the higher dynamic force values [4–6]. The OOR damagesa function of their shape and size, vehicle characteristics and speed [7–10]. Wheel flats induce high dynamic impact loads on the railway infrastructure, which causes significant damage to both tracks and vehicles, such as broken axles, damaged rolling bearings and cracks in the wheels, rails and sleepers . Moreover, it also generates high vibrations\ntransmitted to the rolling stock, inducing significant stresses and causing damage to the In the case of polygonal wheels, the formation mechanism can be roughly classified\ninto three categories, namely, (1) initial wheel defects , (2) a natural vibration of the\nvehicle–track system and (3) thermoelastic instability . The formation mechanism is strongly contingent on the vehicle type and its operational characteristics, withof dominant harmonic orders [19–22]. For example, Tao et al. studied asymmetrical polygonal wear on metro wheels and obtained harmonic orders of 12–14, while another study by Tao et al. found that the most common harmonic order in Chinese freight trains is 18–19. Although a polygonal wheel could generate less impact on the track than a\nwheel flat, this defect can cause serious damage to the track due to resonance effects in the\nTo identify the occurrence of these OOR anomalies in train wheels, innovative\nmethodologies have been developed combining signal processing and automatic learning techniques. These methodologies are based on the extraction of damage sensitivity features, making possible the distinction between undamaged and damaged situations. Recently, many studies have shown good results in detecting OOR damages using\ndistinct approaches [24–29]. Mishra et al. concluded that a single FBG (Fiber Bragg Grating) sensor, positioned along the rail can detect the presence of wheel flats.\nLourenço et al. created an automatic algorithm for diagnosing OOR defects. The\nproposed methodology consists of isolating specific defective wheels and then identifying the severity of the damage, using only acceleration and strain data measured on\nthe track. In another study, Krummenacher et al. , proposed two machine-learningBy extracting the features, it is possible to transform the measured data into an alternative form of information where the correlation with damage is more easily observed. There are various techniques for feature extraction, the most common being CWT\n(continuous wavelet transform) [31–33], PCA (principal component analysis) ,detection of polygonal wheels on freight vehicles using CWT and ARX features, using\n6 accelerometers, 3 on each side of the railway track. Mosleh et al. introduced aflats by extracting AR features from acceleration records. Moreover, Mohammadi et al.\nadopted linear features, particularly, CWT, PCA, ARX and AR, and their research findingsin the context of wheel flat damage detection. Although these studies have demonstrated robust results in detection, they show some limitations in dealing with the non-linear effects associated with operational effects, such as the train speed. Due to the inability of these linear techniques to attenuate operation effects, the inclusion of different speeds\nFor most of these studies, a feature normalisation stage is used when it is necessary to remove the operational effects. Usually, latent variable methods are used, such as PCA or multiple linear regression (MLR) . Thus, to deal with the non-linear phenomena and reduce the large amounts of data without relying on the aforementioned methods,\nthe first artificial neural networks were created to inherently execute this task . Over the years, new and more advanced networks have been developed, with the Autoencoder\n(AE) being one of the main types. Later, Olshausen et al. proposed the creation of\nsparse coding and Ng et al. introduced a sparse penalisation term in the hidden layer,\nto acquire more compact and effective features from lower-dimensional data. For some datasets with complex relationships between characteristics, employing more than one SAE\nis necessary, which is why stacked sparse autoencoders (SSAE) are commonly used .\nNowadays, these types of AE are widely used in various scientific fields, but specifically\nfor structural engineering only a few studies are found, and most are about damage detection on bridges [45–47].

Pathirage et al. proposed a framework utilizing SAE’s potential for dimensionality reduction, which facilitated the assessment of damage detection performance on Many of these AE algorithms already performed feature classification in order to discriminate the different types of damages and severities. However, the AE methods can also be combined with other techniques commonly used to classify the data. They can be used unsupervised methods, in which the model is trained without any labels provided to the\ntraining dataset, such as k-means , self-organising maps (SOM) , isolation forest, gaussian mixture model , k-medoids and cluster analysis , or supervised\nmethods, which assume that the hierarchy of database categories is known, such as NaiveBayes classifiers , k-Nearest Neighbours classifiers , Support Vector Machinetwo types of OOR damages, flats and polygonal wheels, based on acceleration responses obtained from a virtual wayside monitoring system.

The application of sensors on both sides of theTo obtain the responses from the railway track, it is necessary to apply sensors on the track that can measure the dynamic responses of the crossing trains. As it is not always possible\nto install them due to the high costs involved, simulations have been carried out based on calibrated models of the track , vehicle and considering their dynamic interaction,\nas well as including the track irregularities. Simulations include cases with healthy wheelsTo simulate the dynamic interactions between the vehicle and the track, an in-house software VSI – Vehicle-Structure Interaction Analysis is used, which was initially developed by\nNeves et al. and later improved by Montenegro et al. .

Including the track irregularities directly in the constraint equations are beneficial since it avoids explicitly considering\nthem in the FEM model. Moreover, it also allows to include the wheel and OOR profiles as a periodic rail irregularity, simplifying the analysis. Thus, before starting the analysis, the\nVSI software imports track irregularities and OOR profiles from a MATLAB file, whichto the vertical and lateral irregularities in each rail in each respective position, and adds it to the constraint equations of the system throughout the dynamics analysis. Then, the\nsystem of dynamic equations is solved using the typical Newmark integration method.\nThe impact of track irregularity on wheel defect classification is significant, as a lower track quality tends to result in a higher likelihood of misclassification. A comprehensive\nexploration of this influence was previously undertaken by Mosleh et al. as documented in their research study . Hence, this study does not delve into the impact of track\nquality; rather, it primarily centres on the utilisation of AI-based methodologies for the detection and classification of wheel defects. For this, four different profiles are used, based\non European Standard EN 13848–2 . In this case, power spectral density (PSD) curvesFor OOR defects, several profiles are defined based on real measurements in representative profiles of the various severities. Subsequently, the structural matrices are imported\nMore details on track and train properties, including additional information on traintrack interaction, can be found in previous publications . Figure 1 shows the\nvehicle–track interaction model schematisation and some details about the train and track\nsubsystems, as well as the track irregularities and wheel-rail contact model.According to the conclusions reached in other studies with this type of damage ,\nthe most promising location of the sensors is on the rail. To reduce installation and maintenance costs, it is important to reduce the number of sensors without compromising the\nquality of the results. Therefore, based on a sensitivity analysis performed during the study,\nonly two vertical unidirectional accelerometers were used on each rail, 4 in total (A1 to A4),\nsince they provided a higher cost–benefit ratio. These sensors are mounted on the rail atdefects, different simulation scenarios with perfect wheels (baseline) and OOR wheels\n(damage) were defined for a five-wagon Laagrss freight train. Based on different crossing speeds, loading schemes and rail irregularities profiles, 120 baseline and 180 damage scenarios (90 for polygonal wheels and 90 for wheel flats) were defined, as summarised in For baseline scenarios, six loading schemes with five different speeds (40, 60, 80, 100\nand 120 km/h) and four rail irregularity profiles were considered, giving a total of 120 scenarios. The loading schemes used are: empty, half-loaded, full-loaded and, additionally,For the damage cases, a total of 90 scenarios were generated for polygonal wheels. These\nscenarios including 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (H1, H2 and H3) x 10 different irregularity profiles within each specified harmonic interval. In these 10 irregularity\nprofiles, based on the defect amplitude, two amplitudes are considered, five simulations for\nA1 and five simulations for A2. Similarly, 90 scenarios were created for wheel flats, involving 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (F1, F2 and F3) x 10 different irregularitywheel radius . This wave phenomenon can be characterised by the different wavelengths formed (harmonics θ ), and by the levels of irregularity ( Lw ) associated with each of the harmonics. According to Peng , it is considered a polygonal wheel when the wear amplitude assumes values above 0. mm and wavelengths between 140 mm and the wheelTo define scenarios with polygonal wheels for the Laagrss wagon, a literature survey on\nexperimental measurements in defective wheels was conducted . Three experimental irregularity profiles were collected, illustrated in Figure 3. The first group (H6-8)\ncorresponds to a study carried out by Cai et al. with dominant harmonics from 6 to 8;**Figure 3.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) of polygonal wheels with**Figure 4.** Examples of polygonal damage profiles for each of the dominant harmonic intervals.the second group (H12-14) to a study authored by Tao et al. with dominant harmonics from 12 to 14; and the third profile (H17-18) to a study performed by Wu et al. with\nBased on the wheel irregularity spectra ( Lw ) taken from the respective measurement profiles, shown in Figure 3, and considering the contribution of the first 30 harmonics, several irregularity profiles were generated, according to Figure 4.

Then,predefined hyperparameters of the algorithm. The set hyperparameters are encoding and\ndecoding transfer functions, hidden layer size, maximum number of epochs, L2 weight regularisation term, sparsity regularisation term and a sparsity proportion term. Afterwards,**Figure 7.** Flowchart with the main phases of the methodology for detection and classification of OORthe features are extracted in the more compressed layer of the SAE, the so-called bottleneck layer. The number of features obtained is equal to the number of hidden layers which\nis usually considerably lower than the data size, allowing a compression of the input data.\nFurthermore, to enhance the sensitivity to damage, two levels of data fusion are applied to the bottleneck features using the Mahalanobis distance. In the first level, all features are\nfused into a damage index (DI) for each sensor and, in the second level, all the sensors\nare merged resulting in only one DI for each simulation. Finally, automatic damage detection is achieved by performing an outlier analysis, in which a statistical confidence limit\n(CB) is used, based on the Inverse Cumulative Gaussian Distribution Function (ICDF).\nFor feature classification, an automatic clustering process based on the k-means technique is implemented. This algorithm allows for the unsupervised and automatic classification of data, based on the calculation of statistical distances between objects. In k-means technique given a vector of data and chosen k clusters, the key is to find k centroids that minimise\nthe distance of each vector to its nearest centroid . Since it is necessary to define the number of clusters in advance, a global Silhouette index (SIL) was adopted to make\nan automatic process. At the end, the clusters will allow the classification of the two typesbetween the number of correct classifications and the total number of cases.damage detection problems, as it allows a signal to be converted from the time domain to the frequency domain, to capture the excitation frequencies induced by the wheel defects.\nIn addition, a data reduction is carried out at this stage, since the initial records contain aa crossing speed of 80 km/h. When comparing the FFT spectra for a train passage with flats, Figure 8a), with polygonal wheels, Figure 8b), there are visible differences in terms\nof amplitude peak values and excited frequency ranges. For flats, the amplitude peak values are higher and they induce frequencies in the range between DC and 1500accordance with some authors reports . In terms of severities, for flats, the more severe group (55–100 mm) is the one with the higher frequency content, as expected,a baseline response. For polygonal wheels, from the analysis of Figure 8b), it can be seen the frequency peaks for the H12–14 and H17–18 profiles around 100 and 150\nrespectively, while for the profile H6-8 a more flat spectrum is obtained without showing any significant peak. This can be explained by the irregularity level profile of thisThese two graphs can show which frequencies have higher content in the original signal.Autoencoders are artificial neural networks trained using an unsupervised approach,\nwhich aim first to learn coded representations of the data, compressing the input into\na latent space representation, and second, through this compressed information, reconstructing the information. The basic architecture of this type of network consists of threewhere **Wij**, **Wjk** are the weights connection matrices between input layer-hidden\nlayer and hidden layer-output layer, **X** = ( **X** 1, **X** 2, . . ., **Xn** ) is the input data vector,\n**H** = ( **H** 1, . . ., **Hm** ) is the low-dimensional vector and **X** [ˆ] = ( **X** [ˆ] 1, **X** [ˆ] 2, . . ., **X** [ˆ] **n** ) is the output**Figure 8.** Frequency domain responses on position 1 for the crossing speed of 80 km/h: (a) wheel flats,data vector. **b** 1, **b** 2 are bias vectors and σ 1, σ 2 are the activation function used in each of thereconstruction of the input X [ˆ], as shown in Equation (3).

After incorporating various inputs into the SSAE training, they are integrated into the so-called\n‘Input 1’. As training progresses, the data is compressed, and the main characteristics of the signals are obtained and retained in ‘Bottleneck 1’. Subsequently, these characteristics are\nused as input for training the second sparse autoencoder, which, after further compression,\nenables the extraction of the final features. Depending on the type of data under analysis,\nthe compression level differs, so multiple tests should be conducted to optimise these layer sizes. This optimisation was achieved by trial and test, changing both the size of the first\nIt should be noted that this network architecture, where the dimensions of the layers gradually decrease along the network until reaching the bottleneck layer , has proven\nto be highly robust for the type of data used. It allows for effective compression of results**Figure 9.** Schematic of the structure of the SSAE neural network used in this study.After extracting the features from the bottleneck layer of the SSAE, the difference between the healthy wheels scenarios and the damage wheels scenarios is still not sufficient. Hence\na data fusion is performed. With this fusion, it is possible to increase the sensitivity of the\nfeatures, and as a result, to obtain a damage index (DI) for each simulation. Thus, the Mahalanobis distance (MD) is used to reduce the volume of extracted data and preserve the most relevant information . Briefly, MD is a metric that measures the distance between two points in a feature space consisting of two or more variables, being independent of the\nscale of the features, thus allowing an increase in the sensitivity of the features to cases with damage. The MD, denoted here as DI, is calculated for each simulation using the followingin which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−], and ¯ x is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The MD is calculated for each sensor and for each simulation, obtaining a matrix of n distances per k number of sensors.Finally, the discrimination of the features consists in distinguishing the features as corresponding to a healthy or damaged case. At this stage of the methodology, an analysis of\nabnormal values is carried out, which will allow the condition of the train wheels to beautomatically monitored and these values to be classified into different classes. This phaseThe outlier analysis consists of grouping, by probabilistic distribution processes, the datato the previously created group. For this, a statistical confidence limit (CB) is used, based on the inverse cumulative Gaussian distribution function (ICDF), considering the mean\nvalue, ¯ μ, and standard deviation, σ, of the baseline feature vector.Whenever a value of a DI indicator is equal to or greater than CB, it is considered an outlier (the null hypothesis is rejected), thus representing a case of damage.For feature classification, a clustering process is used to divide the dataset into distinct clusters that should be as compact and separated as possible . For clustering, the k-meanson the distances of their vectors. Recent studies showed that the k-means algorithm has shown promising results . The main limitation of this technique is that it requires\nknowledge of the number of clusters in advance. For this purpose, the global silhouetteThis section presents the main results obtained through the application of the methodology proposed in section 3 to the calculated track responses. The methodology is applied using damaged wheel passages for the three simulated train speeds (60, 80 and 100 km/h),hyperparameters (presented in section 3). By adjusting these hyperparameters, it is possible to make the algorithm more efficient and improve the generalisation capabilities, as only\nthe most important features are retained. The optimisation of these hyperparameters isof data under analysis. Based on the principles of the SAE already outlined in other works\nIn the context of this study, the non-linear transfer functions (logsig) proved to be more effective than the linear ones, being the ones used in all the studied cases. After analysing Table 3, there is a similarity in the hyperparameters when comparing the two types of OOR damage. It is observed that the data compression level is the same for both cases, around\n93%, as 500 features are extracted in Bottleneck 2 from the initial input data with 7000\nConcerning the type of damage situation, the size of the ‘Bottleneck 1’ and ‘Bottleneck\n2’ was increased to bring them even closer to the initial amount of input data. This can beanalysis, making it challenging for the autoencoder to define relationships between the data, hence requiring a larger number. On the contrary, the maximum number of epochsIt is also important to emphasise that of the various hyperparameters presented, theOnce the hyperparameters have been defined, all the steps of the methodology are applied to the new dataset. For simplicity, in this section, only the last phase of the methodology will be presented, namely an outlier analysis for damage detection and cluster analysis for damage classification. For each sensor, a matrix n × m is created, where n\nis the number of test passages (baseline scenarios + damage scenarios), and m represents the number of extracted features. So, the size of the matrices is 210 × 2000 in case of the\ntype of damage, 75 × 500 for each amplitude in polygonal wheel, and 120 × 500 for wheelDespite the visual distinction between healthy and damaged wheels based on the data processing presented in subsection 3.2, unsupervised learning must use strategies capable of automatically detecting damage. To this end, an outlier analysis is employed, which consists of defining a confidence threshold using a significance level of 1% , represented**Figure 10.** Automatic OOR damage detection based on outlier analysis.by the green line in Figure 10. This approach makes it possible to successfully detect allTo distinguish the two types of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed. Figure 11\nshows a clear distinction between the damage, even when using a dataset with three different train speeds (60,80 and 100 km/h).. In the case of Figure 11a), using all four\naccelerometers, it is possible to efficiently separate the set into two large clusters, despite\n30 misclassifications (16 in the polygonisation and 14 in the flats). Even so, the accuracy\npercentage is around 85%, which is a very good result. To analyse the sensitivity to the number of sensors, only two sensors were used, one on each side ). The results\nimproved, with a decrease in the number of misclassifications from 30 to 21 (13 for polygonisation and 8 for flats). One explanation could be the disparity in sensor sensitivity to the damage, where some sensors are more sensitive than others due to their spatial positioning in relation to the damage. By merging the data from the less sensitive sensors with the\nmore sensitive ones, this could have a negative impact on the results. Thus, the percentage\nThe purpose behind presenting these two plots was to demonstrate that, whether using 4 sensors or 2 sensors, the classification remains remarkably robust, showing lowAfter identifying the type of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed once again to\nclassify the severity of each damage separately. Regarding polygonal wheels, the classification involves both amplitude and harmonic orders, leading to the clusters depicted in the obtained clusters reasonably reflect the two amplitude groups, with all misclassifications associated with the H6-8 harmonic cases (17 misclassifications). Once the amplitude\nis identified, harmonic classification must be carried out separately for each of the amplitudes. In Figure 12b), related to amplitude A1, it is observed that the obtained clusters**Figure 11.** Automatic OOR damage classification based on cluster analysis using: a) 4 sensors; b) 2are nearly perfect, with only 3 misclassifications. In Figure 12c), there are only 3 misclassifications, totalling 8 misclassifications in the classification of the number of dominant\nThe classification of harmonic order is only possible with the separation of amplitudes,\nFigure 13 presents the clusters obtained for the wheel flat cases. The separation between\nthe less severe group and baseline cases and intermediate (cluster 3) and severe cases (cluster 4) is reduced, resulting in a total of 19 misclassifications. Nevertheless, this result showsrate of about 84%. One possible reason for this significant number of misclassifications could be directly associated with the number of impacts captured by the sensor.In order to contribute to the safety of railway transportation and service quality, an automatic methodology based on machine learning has been proposed. This methodology can accurately detect and classify two types of OOR wheel damage in railway vehicles allowing to mitigate problems at both track and vehicle level, such as derailments or material\ndegradation. It includes a new technique for feature extraction based on a dedicated neural network, the Sparse Autoencoder. This non-linear technique is an upgrade concerning the commonly used linear techniques for feature extraction since it allows a better normalisation of the operational effects in the analysed data, as well as the reduction of large amounts\nof data without relying on other techniques, while keeping the most valuable information. These improvements are achieved through the use of different hyperparameters in**Figure 12.** Automatic classification of polygonal wheels based on cluster analysis: a) amplitude A1-A2;**Figure 13.** Automatic classification of wheel flats based on cluster analysis.the calculations, such as non-linear activation functions and sparsity terms. Consequently,circulation. Particularly in the railway engineering field, the inclusion of this technique\nshowed a good potential to deal with variable train speeds, essentially due to the amplifying effect on the measured track dynamic responses which could induce errors in damage The application of the methodology to the data set proved to be very successful in detecting and classifying the two types of OOR damages. Damage detection was perfect, without\nany false detection. In terms of classifying the type of damage, the results are very good,\nwith a success rate of around 85%, but if only two accelerometers are considered the successrate increases to around 90%. These results are encouraging since the range of speeds considered in the analysis, between 60 and 100 km/h, is the most representative of in-service\nfreight trains. Also, the results show that including the Sparse Autoencoder has a positive\neffect in the normalization of the train speed in the damage data set.\nRegarding the severity classification for each type of damage, the methodology proved equally successful in clustering the different damage severities. For polygonal wheels, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the severity groups in terms of defect amplitude, failing only for the H6-8 harmonic cases, and in terms of harmonic orders for each amplitude,\nwith almost perfect results. For wheel flats, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the three severity groups, though with some misclassifications between the less severe group\nand baseline cases and between intermediate and severe cases. A success rate of around 86%\nis achieved in the classification of polygonal wheel severities and 84% in the classification of wheel flat severities. Even so, these high success rates of over 80% show the robustness\nof this methodology in damage classification regardless of the train speed.on on-site measurements. Additionally, this methodology could be carried out for other types of railway vehicles, for example, passenger vehicles, since the dynamic responses are\ndifferent from freight vehicles. In that case, exploring other recent types of autoencoders,\nTo increase the complexity of the problem, the objective is to explore the concept of\nmultiple damages (same or different OOR types). For this, it will be necessary to incorporate a new stage in the methodology, the damage location stage, which will make it possible\nto distinguish isolated damage from multiple damage, as well as their respective location.\nThus, damage will be identified using cut signals, which will then be used to classify theThis work is a result of project WAY4SafeRail-WAYside monitoring system FOR SAFE RAIL transportation, with reference NORTE-01-0247-FEDER-069595, co-funded by the European Regional\nDevelopment Fund (ERDF), through the North Portugal Regional Operational Programme\nPartnership Agreement.

Within this context,\nan unsupervised methodology based on artificial intelligence techniques is presented, which allows the detection and classification of wheels, based on dynamic responses induced on the track by crossing freight railway vehicles. The methodology involves the following\nsteps: (i) data collection and pre-processing, (ii) feature extraction (iii)\ndata fusion and (iv) feature discrimination. In the first phase, an FFT\nalgorithm is applied to the acceleration track responses. Then, features are extracted after training a Stacked Sparse Autoencoder, in which the main features of the responses are obtained after a compression stage using an encoder network. This lower dimensional\nlayer forces the model to learn a compression of the input data. Then,\nwhich enhances the sensitivity to the damage recognition. Posteriorly, an outlier analysis is performed to distinguish a healthy wheelRail vehicle wheels are subjected to constant wear and tear due to continuous use and inadequate maintenance plans. Over time, this wear and tear can generate more significant defects, so it is extremely important to use sensing to understand when maintenance of both the track and rolling stock is required.

However, this type of system entail high costs envisaging the vehicle wheel condition monitoring, since sensors need to be installed in every vehicle in order to achieve a good representativity . On the other hand, wayside systems are a more viable solution for identifying wheel defects, since the condition of allThe most common wheel defects are known as OOR. As the name infers, this defect is related to deformations on the surface of the wheel circumference that make it not round.\nThis deformation can have many forms and different causes, leading to faults on the vehicle and on the track due to the higher dynamic force values [4–6]. The OOR damagesa function of their shape and size, vehicle characteristics and speed [7–10]. Wheel flats induce high dynamic impact loads on the railway infrastructure, which causes significant damage to both tracks and vehicles, such as broken axles, damaged rolling bearings and cracks in the wheels, rails and sleepers . Moreover, it also generates high vibrations\ntransmitted to the rolling stock, inducing significant stresses and causing damage to the In the case of polygonal wheels, the formation mechanism can be roughly classified\ninto three categories, namely, (1) initial wheel defects , (2) a natural vibration of the\nvehicle–track system and (3) thermoelastic instability . The formation mechanism is strongly contingent on the vehicle type and its operational characteristics, withof dominant harmonic orders [19–22]. For example, Tao et al. studied asymmetrical polygonal wear on metro wheels and obtained harmonic orders of 12–14, while another study by Tao et al. found that the most common harmonic order in Chinese freight trains is 18–19. Although a polygonal wheel could generate less impact on the track than a\nwheel flat, this defect can cause serious damage to the track due to resonance effects in the\nTo identify the occurrence of these OOR anomalies in train wheels, innovative\nmethodologies have been developed combining signal processing and automatic learning techniques. These methodologies are based on the extraction of damage sensitivity features, making possible the distinction between undamaged and damaged situations. Recently, many studies have shown good results in detecting OOR damages using\ndistinct approaches [24–29]. Mishra et al. concluded that a single FBG (Fiber Bragg Grating) sensor, positioned along the rail can detect the presence of wheel flats.\nLourenço et al. created an automatic algorithm for diagnosing OOR defects. The\nproposed methodology consists of isolating specific defective wheels and then identifying the severity of the damage, using only acceleration and strain data measured on\nthe track. In another study, Krummenacher et al. , proposed two machine-learningBy extracting the features, it is possible to transform the measured data into an alternative form of information where the correlation with damage is more easily observed. There are various techniques for feature extraction, the most common being CWT\n(continuous wavelet transform) [31–33], PCA (principal component analysis) ,detection of polygonal wheels on freight vehicles using CWT and ARX features, using\n6 accelerometers, 3 on each side of the railway track. Mosleh et al. introduced aflats by extracting AR features from acceleration records. Moreover, Mohammadi et al.\nadopted linear features, particularly, CWT, PCA, ARX and AR, and their research findingsin the context of wheel flat damage detection. Although these studies have demonstrated robust results in detection, they show some limitations in dealing with the non-linear effects associated with operational effects, such as the train speed. Due to the inability of these linear techniques to attenuate operation effects, the inclusion of different speeds\nFor most of these studies, a feature normalisation stage is used when it is necessary to remove the operational effects. Usually, latent variable methods are used, such as PCA or multiple linear regression (MLR) . Thus, to deal with the non-linear phenomena and reduce the large amounts of data without relying on the aforementioned methods,\nthe first artificial neural networks were created to inherently execute this task . Over the years, new and more advanced networks have been developed, with the Autoencoder\n(AE) being one of the main types. Later, Olshausen et al. proposed the creation of\nsparse coding and Ng et al. introduced a sparse penalisation term in the hidden layer,\nto acquire more compact and effective features from lower-dimensional data. For some datasets with complex relationships between characteristics, employing more than one SAE\nis necessary, which is why stacked sparse autoencoders (SSAE) are commonly used .\nNowadays, these types of AE are widely used in various scientific fields, but specifically\nfor structural engineering only a few studies are found, and most are about damage detection on bridges [45–47]. Amaral et al. , proposed an approach for detecting structural anomalies based on SAE and Shewhart’s T control chart. The characteristics extracted byin structures. In another similar study, Amaral et al. , applied the same approach to\na numerical model of a highway viaduct in Brazil reaching more than 99% of successful classifications of structural damage with the combination of SAE and Support Vector Machine. Pathirage et al. proposed a framework utilizing SAE’s potential for dimensionality reduction, which facilitated the assessment of damage detection performance on Many of these AE algorithms already performed feature classification in order to discriminate the different types of damages and severities. However, the AE methods can also be combined with other techniques commonly used to classify the data. They can be used unsupervised methods, in which the model is trained without any labels provided to the\ntraining dataset, such as k-means , self-organising maps (SOM) , isolation forest, gaussian mixture model , k-medoids and cluster analysis , or supervised\nmethods, which assume that the hierarchy of database categories is known, such as NaiveBayes classifiers , k-Nearest Neighbours classifiers , Support Vector Machinetwo types of OOR damages, flats and polygonal wheels, based on acceleration responses obtained from a virtual wayside monitoring system.

The application of sensors on both sides of theTo obtain the responses from the railway track, it is necessary to apply sensors on the track that can measure the dynamic responses of the crossing trains. As it is not always possible\nto install them due to the high costs involved, simulations have been carried out based on calibrated models of the track , vehicle and considering their dynamic interaction,\nas well as including the track irregularities. Simulations include cases with healthy wheelsTo simulate the dynamic interactions between the vehicle and the track, an in-house software VSI – Vehicle-Structure Interaction Analysis is used, which was initially developed by\nNeves et al. and later improved by Montenegro et al. .

Including the track irregularities directly in the constraint equations are beneficial since it avoids explicitly considering\nthem in the FEM model. Moreover, it also allows to include the wheel and OOR profiles as a periodic rail irregularity, simplifying the analysis. Thus, before starting the analysis, the\nVSI software imports track irregularities and OOR profiles from a MATLAB file, whichto the vertical and lateral irregularities in each rail in each respective position, and adds it to the constraint equations of the system throughout the dynamics analysis. Then, the\nsystem of dynamic equations is solved using the typical Newmark integration method.\nThe impact of track irregularity on wheel defect classification is significant, as a lower track quality tends to result in a higher likelihood of misclassification. A comprehensive\nexploration of this influence was previously undertaken by Mosleh et al. as documented in their research study . Hence, this study does not delve into the impact of track\nquality; rather, it primarily centres on the utilisation of AI-based methodologies for the detection and classification of wheel defects. For this, four different profiles are used, based\non European Standard EN 13848–2 .

Figure 1 shows the\nvehicle–track interaction model schematisation and some details about the train and track\nsubsystems, as well as the track irregularities and wheel-rail contact model.According to the conclusions reached in other studies with this type of damage ,\nthe most promising location of the sensors is on the rail. To reduce installation and maintenance costs, it is important to reduce the number of sensors without compromising the\nquality of the results. Therefore, based on a sensitivity analysis performed during the study,\nonly two vertical unidirectional accelerometers were used on each rail, 4 in total (A1 to A4),\nsince they provided a higher cost–benefit ratio. These sensors are mounted on the rail atdefects, different simulation scenarios with perfect wheels (baseline) and OOR wheels\n(damage) were defined for a five-wagon Laagrss freight train. Based on different crossing speeds, loading schemes and rail irregularities profiles, 120 baseline and 180 damage scenarios (90 for polygonal wheels and 90 for wheel flats) were defined, as summarised in For baseline scenarios, six loading schemes with five different speeds (40, 60, 80, 100\nand 120 km/h) and four rail irregularity profiles were considered, giving a total of 120 scenarios. The loading schemes used are: empty, half-loaded, full-loaded and, additionally,For the damage cases, a total of 90 scenarios were generated for polygonal wheels. These\nscenarios including 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (H1, H2 and H3) x 10 different irregularity profiles within each specified harmonic interval. In these 10 irregularity\nprofiles, based on the defect amplitude, two amplitudes are considered, five simulations for\nA1 and five simulations for A2. Similarly, 90 scenarios were created for wheel flats, involving 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (F1, F2 and F3) x 10 different irregularitywheel radius . This wave phenomenon can be characterised by the different wavelengths formed (harmonics θ ), and by the levels of irregularity ( Lw ) associated with each of the harmonics. According to Peng , it is considered a polygonal wheel when the wear amplitude assumes values above 0. mm and wavelengths between 140 mm and the wheelTo define scenarios with polygonal wheels for the Laagrss wagon, a literature survey on\nexperimental measurements in defective wheels was conducted . Three experimental irregularity profiles were collected, illustrated in Figure 3. The first group (H6-8)\ncorresponds to a study carried out by Cai et al. with dominant harmonics from 6 to 8;**Figure 3.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) of polygonal wheels with**Figure 4.** Examples of polygonal damage profiles for each of the dominant harmonic intervals.the second group (H12-14) to a study authored by Tao et al. with dominant harmonics from 12 to 14; and the third profile (H17-18) to a study performed by Wu et al. with\nBased on the wheel irregularity spectra ( Lw ) taken from the respective measurement profiles, shown in Figure 3, and considering the contribution of the first 30 harmonics, several irregularity profiles were generated, according to Figure 4.

The irregularity profiles are generated randomly, but in this case, in function of two geometric\nvariables, the length and the depth of the flat. More details about the process of generation of flat profiles can be found in the study performed by Mosleh et al .

After obtaining the acceleration measurements from the numerical simulations, an FFT algorithm is applied to the time series allowing the conversion of the signal from the time domain to the frequency domain. Then,predefined hyperparameters of the algorithm. The set hyperparameters are encoding and\ndecoding transfer functions, hidden layer size, maximum number of epochs, L2 weight regularisation term, sparsity regularisation term and a sparsity proportion term. Afterwards,**Figure 7.** Flowchart with the main phases of the methodology for detection and classification of OORthe features are extracted in the more compressed layer of the SAE, the so-called bottleneck layer. The number of features obtained is equal to the number of hidden layers which\nis usually considerably lower than the data size, allowing a compression of the input data.\nFurthermore, to enhance the sensitivity to damage, two levels of data fusion are applied to the bottleneck features using the Mahalanobis distance. In the first level, all features are\nfused into a damage index (DI) for each sensor and, in the second level, all the sensors\nare merged resulting in only one DI for each simulation. Finally, automatic damage detection is achieved by performing an outlier analysis, in which a statistical confidence limit\n(CB) is used, based on the Inverse Cumulative Gaussian Distribution Function (ICDF).\nFor feature classification, an automatic clustering process based on the k-means technique is implemented. This algorithm allows for the unsupervised and automatic classification of data, based on the calculation of statistical distances between objects. In k-means technique given a vector of data and chosen k clusters, the key is to find k centroids that minimise\nthe distance of each vector to its nearest centroid . Since it is necessary to define the number of clusters in advance, a global Silhouette index (SIL) was adopted to make\nan automatic process. At the end, the clusters will allow the classification of the two typesbetween the number of correct classifications and the total number of cases.damage detection problems, as it allows a signal to be converted from the time domain to the frequency domain, to capture the excitation frequencies induced by the wheel defects.\nIn addition, a data reduction is carried out at this stage, since the initial records contain aa crossing speed of 80 km/h. When comparing the FFT spectra for a train passage with flats, Figure 8a), with polygonal wheels, Figure 8b), there are visible differences in terms\nof amplitude peak values and excited frequency ranges. For flats, the amplitude peak values are higher and they induce frequencies in the range between DC and 1500accordance with some authors reports . In terms of severities, for flats, the more severe group (55–100 mm) is the one with the higher frequency content, as expected,a baseline response. For polygonal wheels, from the analysis of Figure 8b), it can be seen the frequency peaks for the H12–14 and H17–18 profiles around 100 and 150\nrespectively, while for the profile H6-8 a more flat spectrum is obtained without showing any significant peak. This can be explained by the irregularity level profile of thisThese two graphs can show which frequencies have higher content in the original signal.Autoencoders are artificial neural networks trained using an unsupervised approach,\nwhich aim first to learn coded representations of the data, compressing the input into\na latent space representation, and second, through this compressed information, reconstructing the information. The basic architecture of this type of network consists of threewhere **Wij**, **Wjk** are the weights connection matrices between input layer-hidden\nlayer and hidden layer-output layer, **X** = ( **X** 1, **X** 2, . . ., **Xn** ) is the input data vector,\n**H** = ( **H** 1, . . ., **Hm** ) is the low-dimensional vector and **X** [ˆ] = ( **X** [ˆ] 1, **X** [ˆ] 2, . . ., **X** [ˆ] **n** ) is the output**Figure 8.** Frequency domain responses on position 1 for the crossing speed of 80 km/h: (a) wheel flats,data vector. **b** 1, **b** 2 are bias vectors and σ 1, σ 2 are the activation function used in each of thereconstruction of the input X [ˆ], as shown in Equation (3).

After incorporating various inputs into the SSAE training, they are integrated into the so-called\n‘Input 1’. As training progresses, the data is compressed, and the main characteristics of the signals are obtained and retained in ‘Bottleneck 1’. Subsequently, these characteristics are\nused as input for training the second sparse autoencoder, which, after further compression,\nenables the extraction of the final features. Depending on the type of data under analysis,\nthe compression level differs, so multiple tests should be conducted to optimise these layer sizes. This optimisation was achieved by trial and test, changing both the size of the first\nIt should be noted that this network architecture, where the dimensions of the layers gradually decrease along the network until reaching the bottleneck layer , has proven\nto be highly robust for the type of data used. It allows for effective compression of results**Figure 9.** Schematic of the structure of the SSAE neural network used in this study.After extracting the features from the bottleneck layer of the SSAE, the difference between the healthy wheels scenarios and the damage wheels scenarios is still not sufficient. Hence\na data fusion is performed. With this fusion, it is possible to increase the sensitivity of the\nfeatures, and as a result, to obtain a damage index (DI) for each simulation. Thus, the Mahalanobis distance (MD) is used to reduce the volume of extracted data and preserve the most relevant information . Briefly, MD is a metric that measures the distance between two points in a feature space consisting of two or more variables, being independent of the\nscale of the features, thus allowing an increase in the sensitivity of the features to cases with damage. The MD, denoted here as DI, is calculated for each simulation using the followingin which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−], and ¯ x is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The MD is calculated for each sensor and for each simulation, obtaining a matrix of n distances per k number of sensors.Finally, the discrimination of the features consists in distinguishing the features as corresponding to a healthy or damaged case. At this stage of the methodology, an analysis of\nabnormal values is carried out, which will allow the condition of the train wheels to beautomatically monitored and these values to be classified into different classes. This phaseThe outlier analysis consists of grouping, by probabilistic distribution processes, the datato the previously created group. For this, a statistical confidence limit (CB) is used, based on the inverse cumulative Gaussian distribution function (ICDF), considering the mean\nvalue, ¯ μ, and standard deviation, σ, of the baseline feature vector.Whenever a value of a DI indicator is equal to or greater than CB, it is considered an outlier (the null hypothesis is rejected), thus representing a case of damage.For feature classification, a clustering process is used to divide the dataset into distinct clusters that should be as compact and separated as possible . For clustering, the k-meanson the distances of their vectors. Recent studies showed that the k-means algorithm has shown promising results . The main limitation of this technique is that it requires\nknowledge of the number of clusters in advance. For this purpose, the global silhouetteThis section presents the main results obtained through the application of the methodology proposed in section 3 to the calculated track responses. The methodology is applied using damaged wheel passages for the three simulated train speeds (60, 80 and 100 km/h),hyperparameters (presented in section 3). By adjusting these hyperparameters, it is possible to make the algorithm more efficient and improve the generalisation capabilities, as only\nthe most important features are retained. The optimisation of these hyperparameters isof data under analysis. Based on the principles of the SAE already outlined in other works\nIn the context of this study, the non-linear transfer functions (logsig) proved to be more effective than the linear ones, being the ones used in all the studied cases. After analysing Table 3, there is a similarity in the hyperparameters when comparing the two types of OOR damage. It is observed that the data compression level is the same for both cases, around\n93%, as 500 features are extracted in Bottleneck 2 from the initial input data with 7000\nConcerning the type of damage situation, the size of the ‘Bottleneck 1’ and ‘Bottleneck\n2’ was increased to bring them even closer to the initial amount of input data. This can beanalysis, making it challenging for the autoencoder to define relationships between the data, hence requiring a larger number. On the contrary, the maximum number of epochsIt is also important to emphasise that of the various hyperparameters presented, theOnce the hyperparameters have been defined, all the steps of the methodology are applied to the new dataset. For simplicity, in this section, only the last phase of the methodology will be presented, namely an outlier analysis for damage detection and cluster analysis for damage classification. For each sensor, a matrix n × m is created, where n\nis the number of test passages (baseline scenarios + damage scenarios), and m represents the number of extracted features. So, the size of the matrices is 210 × 2000 in case of the\ntype of damage, 75 × 500 for each amplitude in polygonal wheel, and 120 × 500 for wheelDespite the visual distinction between healthy and damaged wheels based on the data processing presented in subsection 3.2, unsupervised learning must use strategies capable of automatically detecting damage. To this end, an outlier analysis is employed, which consists of defining a confidence threshold using a significance level of 1% , represented**Figure 10.** Automatic OOR damage detection based on outlier analysis.by the green line in Figure 10. This approach makes it possible to successfully detect allTo distinguish the two types of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed. Figure 11\nshows a clear distinction between the damage, even when using a dataset with three different train speeds (60,80 and 100 km/h)..

The results\nimproved, with a decrease in the number of misclassifications from 30 to 21 (13 for polygonisation and 8 for flats). One explanation could be the disparity in sensor sensitivity to the damage, where some sensors are more sensitive than others due to their spatial positioning in relation to the damage. By merging the data from the less sensitive sensors with the\nmore sensitive ones, this could have a negative impact on the results. Thus, the percentage\nThe purpose behind presenting these two plots was to demonstrate that, whether using 4 sensors or 2 sensors, the classification remains remarkably robust, showing lowAfter identifying the type of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed once again to\nclassify the severity of each damage separately. Regarding polygonal wheels, the classification involves both amplitude and harmonic orders, leading to the clusters depicted in the obtained clusters reasonably reflect the two amplitude groups, with all misclassifications associated with the H6-8 harmonic cases (17 misclassifications). Once the amplitude\nis identified, harmonic classification must be carried out separately for each of the amplitudes. In Figure 12b), related to amplitude A1, it is observed that the obtained clusters**Figure 11.** Automatic OOR damage classification based on cluster analysis using: a) 4 sensors; b) 2are nearly perfect, with only 3 misclassifications. In Figure 12c), there are only 3 misclassifications, totalling 8 misclassifications in the classification of the number of dominant\nThe classification of harmonic order is only possible with the separation of amplitudes,\nFigure 13 presents the clusters obtained for the wheel flat cases. The separation between\nthe less severe group and baseline cases and intermediate (cluster 3) and severe cases (cluster 4) is reduced, resulting in a total of 19 misclassifications. Nevertheless, this result showsrate of about 84%. One possible reason for this significant number of misclassifications could be directly associated with the number of impacts captured by the sensor.In order to contribute to the safety of railway transportation and service quality, an automatic methodology based on machine learning has been proposed. This methodology can accurately detect and classify two types of OOR wheel damage in railway vehicles allowing to mitigate problems at both track and vehicle level, such as derailments or material\ndegradation. It includes a new technique for feature extraction based on a dedicated neural network, the Sparse Autoencoder. This non-linear technique is an upgrade concerning the commonly used linear techniques for feature extraction since it allows a better normalisation of the operational effects in the analysed data, as well as the reduction of large amounts\nof data without relying on other techniques, while keeping the most valuable information. These improvements are achieved through the use of different hyperparameters in**Figure 12.** Automatic classification of polygonal wheels based on cluster analysis: a) amplitude A1-A2;**Figure 13.** Automatic classification of wheel flats based on cluster analysis.the calculations, such as non-linear activation functions and sparsity terms. Consequently,circulation. Particularly in the railway engineering field, the inclusion of this technique\nshowed a good potential to deal with variable train speeds, essentially due to the amplifying effect on the measured track dynamic responses which could induce errors in damage The application of the methodology to the data set proved to be very successful in detecting and classifying the two types of OOR damages. Damage detection was perfect, without\nany false detection. In terms of classifying the type of damage, the results are very good,\nwith a success rate of around 85%, but if only two accelerometers are considered the successrate increases to around 90%. These results are encouraging since the range of speeds considered in the analysis, between 60 and 100 km/h, is the most representative of in-service\nfreight trains. Also, the results show that including the Sparse Autoencoder has a positive\neffect in the normalization of the train speed in the damage data set.\nRegarding the severity classification for each type of damage, the methodology proved equally successful in clustering the different damage severities. For polygonal wheels, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the severity groups in terms of defect amplitude, failing only for the H6-8 harmonic cases, and in terms of harmonic orders for each amplitude,\nwith almost perfect results. For wheel flats, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the three severity groups, though with some misclassifications between the less severe group\nand baseline cases and between intermediate and severe cases. A success rate of around 86%\nis achieved in the classification of polygonal wheel severities and 84% in the classification of wheel flat severities. Even so, these high success rates of over 80% show the robustness\nof this methodology in damage classification regardless of the train speed.on on-site measurements. Additionally, this methodology could be carried out for other types of railway vehicles, for example, passenger vehicles, since the dynamic responses are\ndifferent from freight vehicles. In that case, exploring other recent types of autoencoders,\nTo increase the complexity of the problem, the objective is to explore the concept of\nmultiple damages (same or different OOR types). For this, it will be necessary to incorporate a new stage in the methodology, the damage location stage, which will make it possible\nto distinguish isolated damage from multiple damage, as well as their respective location.\nThus, damage will be identified using cut signals, which will then be used to classify theThis work is a result of project WAY4SafeRail-WAYside monitoring system FOR SAFE RAIL transportation, with reference NORTE-01-0247-FEDER-069595, co-funded by the European Regional\nDevelopment Fund (ERDF), through the North Portugal Regional Operational Programme\nPartnership Agreement.

Within this context,\nan unsupervised methodology based on artificial intelligence techniques is presented, which allows the detection and classification of wheels, based on dynamic responses induced on the track by crossing freight railway vehicles. The methodology involves the following\nsteps: (i) data collection and pre-processing, (ii) feature extraction (iii)\ndata fusion and (iv) feature discrimination. In the first phase, an FFT\nalgorithm is applied to the acceleration track responses. Then, features are extracted after training a Stacked Sparse Autoencoder, in which the main features of the responses are obtained after a compression stage using an encoder network. This lower dimensional\nlayer forces the model to learn a compression of the input data. Then,\nwhich enhances the sensitivity to the damage recognition. Posteriorly, an outlier analysis is performed to distinguish a healthy wheelRail vehicle wheels are subjected to constant wear and tear due to continuous use and inadequate maintenance plans. Over time, this wear and tear can generate more significant defects, so it is extremely important to use sensing to understand when maintenance of both the track and rolling stock is required.

However, this type of system entail high costs envisaging the vehicle wheel condition monitoring, since sensors need to be installed in every vehicle in order to achieve a good representativity . On the other hand, wayside systems are a more viable solution for identifying wheel defects, since the condition of allThe most common wheel defects are known as OOR. As the name infers, this defect is related to deformations on the surface of the wheel circumference that make it not round.\nThis deformation can have many forms and different causes, leading to faults on the vehicle and on the track due to the higher dynamic force values [4–6]. The OOR damagesa function of their shape and size, vehicle characteristics and speed [7–10]. Wheel flats induce high dynamic impact loads on the railway infrastructure, which causes significant damage to both tracks and vehicles, such as broken axles, damaged rolling bearings and cracks in the wheels, rails and sleepers . Moreover, it also generates high vibrations\ntransmitted to the rolling stock, inducing significant stresses and causing damage to the In the case of polygonal wheels, the formation mechanism can be roughly classified\ninto three categories, namely, (1) initial wheel defects , (2) a natural vibration of the\nvehicle–track system and (3) thermoelastic instability . The formation mechanism is strongly contingent on the vehicle type and its operational characteristics, withof dominant harmonic orders [19–22]. For example, Tao et al. studied asymmetrical polygonal wear on metro wheels and obtained harmonic orders of 12–14, while another study by Tao et al. found that the most common harmonic order in Chinese freight trains is 18–19. Although a polygonal wheel could generate less impact on the track than a\nwheel flat, this defect can cause serious damage to the track due to resonance effects in the\nTo identify the occurrence of these OOR anomalies in train wheels, innovative\nmethodologies have been developed combining signal processing and automatic learning techniques. These methodologies are based on the extraction of damage sensitivity features, making possible the distinction between undamaged and damaged situations. Recently, many studies have shown good results in detecting OOR damages using\ndistinct approaches [24–29]. Mishra et al. concluded that a single FBG (Fiber Bragg Grating) sensor, positioned along the rail can detect the presence of wheel flats.\nLourenço et al. created an automatic algorithm for diagnosing OOR defects. The\nproposed methodology consists of isolating specific defective wheels and then identifying the severity of the damage, using only acceleration and strain data measured on\nthe track. In another study, Krummenacher et al. , proposed two machine-learningBy extracting the features, it is possible to transform the measured data into an alternative form of information where the correlation with damage is more easily observed. There are various techniques for feature extraction, the most common being CWT\n(continuous wavelet transform) [31–33], PCA (principal component analysis) ,detection of polygonal wheels on freight vehicles using CWT and ARX features, using\n6 accelerometers, 3 on each side of the railway track. Mosleh et al. introduced aflats by extracting AR features from acceleration records. Moreover, Mohammadi et al.\nadopted linear features, particularly, CWT, PCA, ARX and AR, and their research findingsin the context of wheel flat damage detection. Although these studies have demonstrated robust results in detection, they show some limitations in dealing with the non-linear effects associated with operational effects, such as the train speed. Due to the inability of these linear techniques to attenuate operation effects, the inclusion of different speeds\nFor most of these studies, a feature normalisation stage is used when it is necessary to remove the operational effects. Usually, latent variable methods are used, such as PCA or multiple linear regression (MLR) . Thus, to deal with the non-linear phenomena and reduce the large amounts of data without relying on the aforementioned methods,\nthe first artificial neural networks were created to inherently execute this task . Over the years, new and more advanced networks have been developed, with the Autoencoder\n(AE) being one of the main types. Later, Olshausen et al. proposed the creation of\nsparse coding and Ng et al. introduced a sparse penalisation term in the hidden layer,\nto acquire more compact and effective features from lower-dimensional data. For some datasets with complex relationships between characteristics, employing more than one SAE\nis necessary, which is why stacked sparse autoencoders (SSAE) are commonly used .\nNowadays, these types of AE are widely used in various scientific fields, but specifically\nfor structural engineering only a few studies are found, and most are about damage detection on bridges [45–47].

Pathirage et al. proposed a framework utilizing SAE’s potential for dimensionality reduction, which facilitated the assessment of damage detection performance on Many of these AE algorithms already performed feature classification in order to discriminate the different types of damages and severities. However, the AE methods can also be combined with other techniques commonly used to classify the data. They can be used unsupervised methods, in which the model is trained without any labels provided to the\ntraining dataset, such as k-means , self-organising maps (SOM) , isolation forest, gaussian mixture model , k-medoids and cluster analysis , or supervised\nmethods, which assume that the hierarchy of database categories is known, such as NaiveBayes classifiers , k-Nearest Neighbours classifiers , Support Vector Machinetwo types of OOR damages, flats and polygonal wheels, based on acceleration responses obtained from a virtual wayside monitoring system.

The application of sensors on both sides of theTo obtain the responses from the railway track, it is necessary to apply sensors on the track that can measure the dynamic responses of the crossing trains. As it is not always possible\nto install them due to the high costs involved, simulations have been carried out based on calibrated models of the track , vehicle and considering their dynamic interaction,\nas well as including the track irregularities. Simulations include cases with healthy wheelsTo simulate the dynamic interactions between the vehicle and the track, an in-house software VSI – Vehicle-Structure Interaction Analysis is used, which was initially developed by\nNeves et al. and later improved by Montenegro et al. .

Including the track irregularities directly in the constraint equations are beneficial since it avoids explicitly considering\nthem in the FEM model. Moreover, it also allows to include the wheel and OOR profiles as a periodic rail irregularity, simplifying the analysis. Thus, before starting the analysis, the\nVSI software imports track irregularities and OOR profiles from a MATLAB file, whichto the vertical and lateral irregularities in each rail in each respective position, and adds it to the constraint equations of the system throughout the dynamics analysis. Then, the\nsystem of dynamic equations is solved using the typical Newmark integration method.\nThe impact of track irregularity on wheel defect classification is significant, as a lower track quality tends to result in a higher likelihood of misclassification. A comprehensive\nexploration of this influence was previously undertaken by Mosleh et al. as documented in their research study . Hence, this study does not delve into the impact of track\nquality; rather, it primarily centres on the utilisation of AI-based methodologies for the detection and classification of wheel defects. For this, four different profiles are used, based\non European Standard EN 13848–2 . In this case, power spectral density (PSD) curvesFor OOR defects, several profiles are defined based on real measurements in representative profiles of the various severities. Subsequently, the structural matrices are imported\nMore details on track and train properties, including additional information on traintrack interaction, can be found in previous publications . Figure 1 shows the\nvehicle–track interaction model schematisation and some details about the train and track\nsubsystems, as well as the track irregularities and wheel-rail contact model.According to the conclusions reached in other studies with this type of damage ,\nthe most promising location of the sensors is on the rail. To reduce installation and maintenance costs, it is important to reduce the number of sensors without compromising the\nquality of the results. Therefore, based on a sensitivity analysis performed during the study,\nonly two vertical unidirectional accelerometers were used on each rail, 4 in total (A1 to A4),\nsince they provided a higher cost–benefit ratio. These sensors are mounted on the rail atdefects, different simulation scenarios with perfect wheels (baseline) and OOR wheels\n(damage) were defined for a five-wagon Laagrss freight train. Based on different crossing speeds, loading schemes and rail irregularities profiles, 120 baseline and 180 damage scenarios (90 for polygonal wheels and 90 for wheel flats) were defined, as summarised in For baseline scenarios, six loading schemes with five different speeds (40, 60, 80, 100\nand 120 km/h) and four rail irregularity profiles were considered, giving a total of 120 scenarios. The loading schemes used are: empty, half-loaded, full-loaded and, additionally,For the damage cases, a total of 90 scenarios were generated for polygonal wheels. These\nscenarios including 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (H1, H2 and H3) x 10 different irregularity profiles within each specified harmonic interval. In these 10 irregularity\nprofiles, based on the defect amplitude, two amplitudes are considered, five simulations for\nA1 and five simulations for A2. Similarly, 90 scenarios were created for wheel flats, involving 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (F1, F2 and F3) x 10 different irregularitywheel radius . This wave phenomenon can be characterised by the different wavelengths formed (harmonics θ ), and by the levels of irregularity ( Lw ) associated with each of the harmonics.

Afterwards,**Figure 7.** Flowchart with the main phases of the methodology for detection and classification of OORthe features are extracted in the more compressed layer of the SAE, the so-called bottleneck layer. The number of features obtained is equal to the number of hidden layers which\nis usually considerably lower than the data size, allowing a compression of the input data.\nFurthermore, to enhance the sensitivity to damage, two levels of data fusion are applied to the bottleneck features using the Mahalanobis distance. In the first level, all features are\nfused into a damage index (DI) for each sensor and, in the second level, all the sensors\nare merged resulting in only one DI for each simulation. Finally, automatic damage detection is achieved by performing an outlier analysis, in which a statistical confidence limit\n(CB) is used, based on the Inverse Cumulative Gaussian Distribution Function (ICDF).\nFor feature classification, an automatic clustering process based on the k-means technique is implemented.

At the end, the clusters will allow the classification of the two typesbetween the number of correct classifications and the total number of cases.damage detection problems, as it allows a signal to be converted from the time domain to the frequency domain, to capture the excitation frequencies induced by the wheel defects.\nIn addition, a data reduction is carried out at this stage, since the initial records contain aa crossing speed of 80 km/h. When comparing the FFT spectra for a train passage with flats, Figure 8a), with polygonal wheels, Figure 8b), there are visible differences in terms\nof amplitude peak values and excited frequency ranges. For flats, the amplitude peak values are higher and they induce frequencies in the range between DC and 1500accordance with some authors reports . In terms of severities, for flats, the more severe group (55–100 mm) is the one with the higher frequency content, as expected,a baseline response. For polygonal wheels, from the analysis of Figure 8b), it can be seen the frequency peaks for the H12–14 and H17–18 profiles around 100 and 150\nrespectively, while for the profile H6-8 a more flat spectrum is obtained without showing any significant peak. This can be explained by the irregularity level profile of thisThese two graphs can show which frequencies have higher content in the original signal.Autoencoders are artificial neural networks trained using an unsupervised approach,\nwhich aim first to learn coded representations of the data, compressing the input into\na latent space representation, and second, through this compressed information, reconstructing the information. The basic architecture of this type of network consists of threewhere **Wij**, **Wjk** are the weights connection matrices between input layer-hidden\nlayer and hidden layer-output layer, **X** = ( **X** 1, **X** 2, . . ., **Xn** ) is the input data vector,\n**H** = ( **H** 1, . . ., **Hm** ) is the low-dimensional vector and **X** [ˆ] = ( **X** [ˆ] 1, **X** [ˆ] 2, . . ., **X** [ˆ] **n** ) is the output**Figure 8.** Frequency domain responses on position 1 for the crossing speed of 80 km/h: (a) wheel flats,data vector. **b** 1, **b** 2 are bias vectors and σ 1, σ 2 are the activation function used in each of thereconstruction of the input X [ˆ], as shown in Equation (3). This function uses the meanIn the Sparse Autoencoder, to make the coding more efficient, two regularisation terms,\nsparse penalty term and weight regularisation term, are added to the error function, causing only a subset of neurons to be activated. The average activation of neurons in the hiddenAs the average activation ˆ ρ is intended to be close to a constant ρ (sparsity proportion)\nand it is usually a small positive number near 0, the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence isIn addition to this, a weight regularisation term, called L2 regularisation, is also addedwhere L is the number of hidden layers, nl the output size of layer l, kl the input size ofwhere μ is the coefficient for the L2 regularisation term and β the coefficient for the sparsityAfter data pre-processing, the acceleration responses in the frequency domain, are then In this work, two layers of SAE’s were used to form the network, as shown in Figure 9.layers, with the outputs of the previous autoencoder serving as input for the next one. After incorporating various inputs into the SSAE training, they are integrated into the so-called\n‘Input 1’. As training progresses, the data is compressed, and the main characteristics of the signals are obtained and retained in ‘Bottleneck 1’. Subsequently, these characteristics are\nused as input for training the second sparse autoencoder, which, after further compression,\nenables the extraction of the final features. Depending on the type of data under analysis,\nthe compression level differs, so multiple tests should be conducted to optimise these layer sizes. This optimisation was achieved by trial and test, changing both the size of the first\nIt should be noted that this network architecture, where the dimensions of the layers gradually decrease along the network until reaching the bottleneck layer , has proven\nto be highly robust for the type of data used. It allows for effective compression of results**Figure 9.** Schematic of the structure of the SSAE neural network used in this study.After extracting the features from the bottleneck layer of the SSAE, the difference between the healthy wheels scenarios and the damage wheels scenarios is still not sufficient. Hence\na data fusion is performed. With this fusion, it is possible to increase the sensitivity of the\nfeatures, and as a result, to obtain a damage index (DI) for each simulation. Thus, the Mahalanobis distance (MD) is used to reduce the volume of extracted data and preserve the most relevant information . Briefly, MD is a metric that measures the distance between two points in a feature space consisting of two or more variables, being independent of the\nscale of the features, thus allowing an increase in the sensitivity of the features to cases with damage. The MD, denoted here as DI, is calculated for each simulation using the followingin which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−], and ¯ x is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The MD is calculated for each sensor and for each simulation, obtaining a matrix of n distances per k number of sensors.Finally, the discrimination of the features consists in distinguishing the features as corresponding to a healthy or damaged case. At this stage of the methodology, an analysis of\nabnormal values is carried out, which will allow the condition of the train wheels to beautomatically monitored and these values to be classified into different classes. This phaseThe outlier analysis consists of grouping, by probabilistic distribution processes, the datato the previously created group. For this, a statistical confidence limit (CB) is used, based on the inverse cumulative Gaussian distribution function (ICDF), considering the mean\nvalue, ¯ μ, and standard deviation, σ, of the baseline feature vector.Whenever a value of a DI indicator is equal to or greater than CB, it is considered an outlier (the null hypothesis is rejected), thus representing a case of damage.For feature classification, a clustering process is used to divide the dataset into distinct clusters that should be as compact and separated as possible . For clustering, the k-meanson the distances of their vectors. Recent studies showed that the k-means algorithm has shown promising results . The main limitation of this technique is that it requires\nknowledge of the number of clusters in advance. For this purpose, the global silhouetteThis section presents the main results obtained through the application of the methodology proposed in section 3 to the calculated track responses. The methodology is applied using damaged wheel passages for the three simulated train speeds (60, 80 and 100 km/h),hyperparameters (presented in section 3). By adjusting these hyperparameters, it is possible to make the algorithm more efficient and improve the generalisation capabilities, as only\nthe most important features are retained. The optimisation of these hyperparameters isof data under analysis. Based on the principles of the SAE already outlined in other works\nIn the context of this study, the non-linear transfer functions (logsig) proved to be more effective than the linear ones, being the ones used in all the studied cases. After analysing Table 3, there is a similarity in the hyperparameters when comparing the two types of OOR damage. It is observed that the data compression level is the same for both cases, around\n93%, as 500 features are extracted in Bottleneck 2 from the initial input data with 7000\nConcerning the type of damage situation, the size of the ‘Bottleneck 1’ and ‘Bottleneck\n2’ was increased to bring them even closer to the initial amount of input data. This can beanalysis, making it challenging for the autoencoder to define relationships between the data, hence requiring a larger number. On the contrary, the maximum number of epochsIt is also important to emphasise that of the various hyperparameters presented, theOnce the hyperparameters have been defined, all the steps of the methodology are applied to the new dataset. For simplicity, in this section, only the last phase of the methodology will be presented, namely an outlier analysis for damage detection and cluster analysis for damage classification. For each sensor, a matrix n × m is created, where n\nis the number of test passages (baseline scenarios + damage scenarios), and m represents the number of extracted features. So, the size of the matrices is 210 × 2000 in case of the\ntype of damage, 75 × 500 for each amplitude in polygonal wheel, and 120 × 500 for wheelDespite the visual distinction between healthy and damaged wheels based on the data processing presented in subsection 3.2, unsupervised learning must use strategies capable of automatically detecting damage. To this end, an outlier analysis is employed, which consists of defining a confidence threshold using a significance level of 1% , represented**Figure 10.** Automatic OOR damage detection based on outlier analysis.by the green line in Figure 10. This approach makes it possible to successfully detect allTo distinguish the two types of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed. Figure 11\nshows a clear distinction between the damage, even when using a dataset with three different train speeds (60,80 and 100 km/h).. In the case of Figure 11a), using all four\naccelerometers, it is possible to efficiently separate the set into two large clusters, despite\n30 misclassifications (16 in the polygonisation and 14 in the flats). Even so, the accuracy\npercentage is around 85%, which is a very good result. To analyse the sensitivity to the number of sensors, only two sensors were used, one on each side ). The results\nimproved, with a decrease in the number of misclassifications from 30 to 21 (13 for polygonisation and 8 for flats). One explanation could be the disparity in sensor sensitivity to the damage, where some sensors are more sensitive than others due to their spatial positioning in relation to the damage. By merging the data from the less sensitive sensors with the\nmore sensitive ones, this could have a negative impact on the results. Thus, the percentage\nThe purpose behind presenting these two plots was to demonstrate that, whether using 4 sensors or 2 sensors, the classification remains remarkably robust, showing lowAfter identifying the type of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed once again to\nclassify the severity of each damage separately. Regarding polygonal wheels, the classification involves both amplitude and harmonic orders, leading to the clusters depicted in the obtained clusters reasonably reflect the two amplitude groups, with all misclassifications associated with the H6-8 harmonic cases (17 misclassifications). Once the amplitude\nis identified, harmonic classification must be carried out separately for each of the amplitudes. In Figure 12b), related to amplitude A1, it is observed that the obtained clusters**Figure 11.** Automatic OOR damage classification based on cluster analysis using: a) 4 sensors; b) 2are nearly perfect, with only 3 misclassifications. In Figure 12c), there are only 3 misclassifications, totalling 8 misclassifications in the classification of the number of dominant\nThe classification of harmonic order is only possible with the separation of amplitudes,\nFigure 13 presents the clusters obtained for the wheel flat cases. The separation between\nthe less severe group and baseline cases and intermediate (cluster 3) and severe cases (cluster 4) is reduced, resulting in a total of 19 misclassifications. Nevertheless, this result showsrate of about 84%. One possible reason for this significant number of misclassifications could be directly associated with the number of impacts captured by the sensor.In order to contribute to the safety of railway transportation and service quality, an automatic methodology based on machine learning has been proposed. This methodology can accurately detect and classify two types of OOR wheel damage in railway vehicles allowing to mitigate problems at both track and vehicle level, such as derailments or material\ndegradation. It includes a new technique for feature extraction based on a dedicated neural network, the Sparse Autoencoder. This non-linear technique is an upgrade concerning the commonly used linear techniques for feature extraction since it allows a better normalisation of the operational effects in the analysed data, as well as the reduction of large amounts\nof data without relying on other techniques, while keeping the most valuable information. These improvements are achieved through the use of different hyperparameters in**Figure 12.** Automatic classification of polygonal wheels based on cluster analysis: a) amplitude A1-A2;**Figure 13.** Automatic classification of wheel flats based on cluster analysis.the calculations, such as non-linear activation functions and sparsity terms. Consequently,circulation. Particularly in the railway engineering field, the inclusion of this technique\nshowed a good potential to deal with variable train speeds, essentially due to the amplifying effect on the measured track dynamic responses which could induce errors in damage The application of the methodology to the data set proved to be very successful in detecting and classifying the two types of OOR damages. Damage detection was perfect, without\nany false detection. In terms of classifying the type of damage, the results are very good,\nwith a success rate of around 85%, but if only two accelerometers are considered the successrate increases to around 90%. These results are encouraging since the range of speeds considered in the analysis, between 60 and 100 km/h, is the most representative of in-service\nfreight trains. Also, the results show that including the Sparse Autoencoder has a positive\neffect in the normalization of the train speed in the damage data set.\nRegarding the severity classification for each type of damage, the methodology proved equally successful in clustering the different damage severities. For polygonal wheels, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the severity groups in terms of defect amplitude, failing only for the H6-8 harmonic cases, and in terms of harmonic orders for each amplitude,\nwith almost perfect results. For wheel flats, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the three severity groups, though with some misclassifications between the less severe group\nand baseline cases and between intermediate and severe cases. A success rate of around 86%\nis achieved in the classification of polygonal wheel severities and 84% in the classification of wheel flat severities. Even so, these high success rates of over 80% show the robustness\nof this methodology in damage classification regardless of the train speed.on on-site measurements. Additionally, this methodology could be carried out for other types of railway vehicles, for example, passenger vehicles, since the dynamic responses are\ndifferent from freight vehicles. In that case, exploring other recent types of autoencoders,\nTo increase the complexity of the problem, the objective is to explore the concept of\nmultiple damages (same or different OOR types). For this, it will be necessary to incorporate a new stage in the methodology, the damage location stage, which will make it possible\nto distinguish isolated damage from multiple damage, as well as their respective location.\nThus, damage will be identified using cut signals, which will then be used to classify theThis work is a result of project WAY4SafeRail-WAYside monitoring system FOR SAFE RAIL transportation, with reference NORTE-01-0247-FEDER-069595, co-funded by the European Regional\nDevelopment Fund (ERDF), through the North Portugal Regional Operational Programme\nPartnership Agreement.

However, this type of system entail high costs envisaging the vehicle wheel condition monitoring, since sensors need to be installed in every vehicle in order to achieve a good representativity . On the other hand, wayside systems are a more viable solution for identifying wheel defects, since the condition of allThe most common wheel defects are known as OOR. As the name infers, this defect is related to deformations on the surface of the wheel circumference that make it not round.\nThis deformation can have many forms and different causes, leading to faults on the vehicle and on the track due to the higher dynamic force values [4–6]. The OOR damagesa function of their shape and size, vehicle characteristics and speed [7–10]. Wheel flats induce high dynamic impact loads on the railway infrastructure, which causes significant damage to both tracks and vehicles, such as broken axles, damaged rolling bearings and cracks in the wheels, rails and sleepers . Moreover, it also generates high vibrations\ntransmitted to the rolling stock, inducing significant stresses and causing damage to the In the case of polygonal wheels, the formation mechanism can be roughly classified\ninto three categories, namely, (1) initial wheel defects , (2) a natural vibration of the\nvehicle–track system and (3) thermoelastic instability . The formation mechanism is strongly contingent on the vehicle type and its operational characteristics, withof dominant harmonic orders [19–22]. For example, Tao et al. studied asymmetrical polygonal wear on metro wheels and obtained harmonic orders of 12–14, while another study by Tao et al. found that the most common harmonic order in Chinese freight trains is 18–19. Although a polygonal wheel could generate less impact on the track than a\nwheel flat, this defect can cause serious damage to the track due to resonance effects in the\nTo identify the occurrence of these OOR anomalies in train wheels, innovative\nmethodologies have been developed combining signal processing and automatic learning techniques. These methodologies are based on the extraction of damage sensitivity features, making possible the distinction between undamaged and damaged situations. Recently, many studies have shown good results in detecting OOR damages using\ndistinct approaches [24–29]. Mishra et al. concluded that a single FBG (Fiber Bragg Grating) sensor, positioned along the rail can detect the presence of wheel flats.\nLourenço et al. created an automatic algorithm for diagnosing OOR defects. The\nproposed methodology consists of isolating specific defective wheels and then identifying the severity of the damage, using only acceleration and strain data measured on\nthe track. In another study, Krummenacher et al. , proposed two machine-learningBy extracting the features, it is possible to transform the measured data into an alternative form of information where the correlation with damage is more easily observed. There are various techniques for feature extraction, the most common being CWT\n(continuous wavelet transform) [31–33], PCA (principal component analysis) ,detection of polygonal wheels on freight vehicles using CWT and ARX features, using\n6 accelerometers, 3 on each side of the railway track. Mosleh et al. introduced aflats by extracting AR features from acceleration records. Moreover, Mohammadi et al.\nadopted linear features, particularly, CWT, PCA, ARX and AR, and their research findingsin the context of wheel flat damage detection. Although these studies have demonstrated robust results in detection, they show some limitations in dealing with the non-linear effects associated with operational effects, such as the train speed. Due to the inability of these linear techniques to attenuate operation effects, the inclusion of different speeds\nFor most of these studies, a feature normalisation stage is used when it is necessary to remove the operational effects. Usually, latent variable methods are used, such as PCA or multiple linear regression (MLR) . Thus, to deal with the non-linear phenomena and reduce the large amounts of data without relying on the aforementioned methods,\nthe first artificial neural networks were created to inherently execute this task .

The application of sensors on both sides of theTo obtain the responses from the railway track, it is necessary to apply sensors on the track that can measure the dynamic responses of the crossing trains. As it is not always possible\nto install them due to the high costs involved, simulations have been carried out based on calibrated models of the track , vehicle and considering their dynamic interaction,\nas well as including the track irregularities.

Including the track irregularities directly in the constraint equations are beneficial since it avoids explicitly considering\nthem in the FEM model. Moreover, it also allows to include the wheel and OOR profiles as a periodic rail irregularity, simplifying the analysis. Thus, before starting the analysis, the\nVSI software imports track irregularities and OOR profiles from a MATLAB file, whichto the vertical and lateral irregularities in each rail in each respective position, and adds it to the constraint equations of the system throughout the dynamics analysis. Then, the\nsystem of dynamic equations is solved using the typical Newmark integration method.\nThe impact of track irregularity on wheel defect classification is significant, as a lower track quality tends to result in a higher likelihood of misclassification. A comprehensive\nexploration of this influence was previously undertaken by Mosleh et al. as documented in their research study . Hence, this study does not delve into the impact of track\nquality; rather, it primarily centres on the utilisation of AI-based methodologies for the detection and classification of wheel defects. For this, four different profiles are used, based\non European Standard EN 13848–2 . In this case, power spectral density (PSD) curvesFor OOR defects, several profiles are defined based on real measurements in representative profiles of the various severities. Subsequently, the structural matrices are imported\nMore details on track and train properties, including additional information on traintrack interaction, can be found in previous publications . Figure 1 shows the\nvehicle–track interaction model schematisation and some details about the train and track\nsubsystems, as well as the track irregularities and wheel-rail contact model.According to the conclusions reached in other studies with this type of damage ,\nthe most promising location of the sensors is on the rail. To reduce installation and maintenance costs, it is important to reduce the number of sensors without compromising the\nquality of the results. Therefore, based on a sensitivity analysis performed during the study,\nonly two vertical unidirectional accelerometers were used on each rail, 4 in total (A1 to A4),\nsince they provided a higher cost–benefit ratio. These sensors are mounted on the rail atdefects, different simulation scenarios with perfect wheels (baseline) and OOR wheels\n(damage) were defined for a five-wagon Laagrss freight train. Based on different crossing speeds, loading schemes and rail irregularities profiles, 120 baseline and 180 damage scenarios (90 for polygonal wheels and 90 for wheel flats) were defined, as summarised in For baseline scenarios, six loading schemes with five different speeds (40, 60, 80, 100\nand 120 km/h) and four rail irregularity profiles were considered, giving a total of 120 scenarios. The loading schemes used are: empty, half-loaded, full-loaded and, additionally,For the damage cases, a total of 90 scenarios were generated for polygonal wheels. These\nscenarios including 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (H1, H2 and H3) x 10 different irregularity profiles within each specified harmonic interval. In these 10 irregularity\nprofiles, based on the defect amplitude, two amplitudes are considered, five simulations for\nA1 and five simulations for A2. Similarly, 90 scenarios were created for wheel flats, involving 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (F1, F2 and F3) x 10 different irregularitywheel radius . This wave phenomenon can be characterised by the different wavelengths formed (harmonics θ ), and by the levels of irregularity ( Lw ) associated with each of the harmonics. According to Peng , it is considered a polygonal wheel when the wear amplitude assumes values above 0. mm and wavelengths between 140 mm and the wheelTo define scenarios with polygonal wheels for the Laagrss wagon, a literature survey on\nexperimental measurements in defective wheels was conducted . Three experimental irregularity profiles were collected, illustrated in Figure 3. The first group (H6-8)\ncorresponds to a study carried out by Cai et al. with dominant harmonics from 6 to 8;**Figure 3.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) of polygonal wheels with**Figure 4.** Examples of polygonal damage profiles for each of the dominant harmonic intervals.the second group (H12-14) to a study authored by Tao et al. with dominant harmonics from 12 to 14; and the third profile (H17-18) to a study performed by Wu et al. with\nBased on the wheel irregularity spectra ( Lw ) taken from the respective measurement profiles, shown in Figure 3, and considering the contribution of the first 30 harmonics, several irregularity profiles were generated, according to Figure 4.

Then,predefined hyperparameters of the algorithm. The set hyperparameters are encoding and\ndecoding transfer functions, hidden layer size, maximum number of epochs, L2 weight regularisation term, sparsity regularisation term and a sparsity proportion term. Afterwards,**Figure 7.** Flowchart with the main phases of the methodology for detection and classification of OORthe features are extracted in the more compressed layer of the SAE, the so-called bottleneck layer. The number of features obtained is equal to the number of hidden layers which\nis usually considerably lower than the data size, allowing a compression of the input data.\nFurthermore, to enhance the sensitivity to damage, two levels of data fusion are applied to the bottleneck features using the Mahalanobis distance. In the first level, all features are\nfused into a damage index (DI) for each sensor and, in the second level, all the sensors\nare merged resulting in only one DI for each simulation. Finally, automatic damage detection is achieved by performing an outlier analysis, in which a statistical confidence limit\n(CB) is used, based on the Inverse Cumulative Gaussian Distribution Function (ICDF).\nFor feature classification, an automatic clustering process based on the k-means technique is implemented. This algorithm allows for the unsupervised and automatic classification of data, based on the calculation of statistical distances between objects. In k-means technique given a vector of data and chosen k clusters, the key is to find k centroids that minimise\nthe distance of each vector to its nearest centroid . Since it is necessary to define the number of clusters in advance, a global Silhouette index (SIL) was adopted to make\nan automatic process. At the end, the clusters will allow the classification of the two typesbetween the number of correct classifications and the total number of cases.damage detection problems, as it allows a signal to be converted from the time domain to the frequency domain, to capture the excitation frequencies induced by the wheel defects.\nIn addition, a data reduction is carried out at this stage, since the initial records contain aa crossing speed of 80 km/h. When comparing the FFT spectra for a train passage with flats, Figure 8a), with polygonal wheels, Figure 8b), there are visible differences in terms\nof amplitude peak values and excited frequency ranges. For flats, the amplitude peak values are higher and they induce frequencies in the range between DC and 1500accordance with some authors reports . In terms of severities, for flats, the more severe group (55–100 mm) is the one with the higher frequency content, as expected,a baseline response. For polygonal wheels, from the analysis of Figure 8b), it can be seen the frequency peaks for the H12–14 and H17–18 profiles around 100 and 150\nrespectively, while for the profile H6-8 a more flat spectrum is obtained without showing any significant peak. This can be explained by the irregularity level profile of thisThese two graphs can show which frequencies have higher content in the original signal.Autoencoders are artificial neural networks trained using an unsupervised approach,\nwhich aim first to learn coded representations of the data, compressing the input into\na latent space representation, and second, through this compressed information, reconstructing the information. The basic architecture of this type of network consists of threewhere **Wij**, **Wjk** are the weights connection matrices between input layer-hidden\nlayer and hidden layer-output layer, **X** = ( **X** 1, **X** 2, . . ., **Xn** ) is the input data vector,\n**H** = ( **H** 1, . . ., **Hm** ) is the low-dimensional vector and **X** [ˆ] = ( **X** [ˆ] 1, **X** [ˆ] 2, . . ., **X** [ˆ] **n** ) is the output**Figure 8.** Frequency domain responses on position 1 for the crossing speed of 80 km/h: (a) wheel flats,data vector. **b** 1, **b** 2 are bias vectors and σ 1, σ 2 are the activation function used in each of thereconstruction of the input X [ˆ], as shown in Equation (3).

After incorporating various inputs into the SSAE training, they are integrated into the so-called\n‘Input 1’. As training progresses, the data is compressed, and the main characteristics of the signals are obtained and retained in ‘Bottleneck 1’. Subsequently, these characteristics are\nused as input for training the second sparse autoencoder, which, after further compression,\nenables the extraction of the final features. Depending on the type of data under analysis,\nthe compression level differs, so multiple tests should be conducted to optimise these layer sizes. This optimisation was achieved by trial and test, changing both the size of the first\nIt should be noted that this network architecture, where the dimensions of the layers gradually decrease along the network until reaching the bottleneck layer , has proven\nto be highly robust for the type of data used. It allows for effective compression of results**Figure 9.** Schematic of the structure of the SSAE neural network used in this study.After extracting the features from the bottleneck layer of the SSAE, the difference between the healthy wheels scenarios and the damage wheels scenarios is still not sufficient. Hence\na data fusion is performed. With this fusion, it is possible to increase the sensitivity of the\nfeatures, and as a result, to obtain a damage index (DI) for each simulation. Thus, the Mahalanobis distance (MD) is used to reduce the volume of extracted data and preserve the most relevant information . Briefly, MD is a metric that measures the distance between two points in a feature space consisting of two or more variables, being independent of the\nscale of the features, thus allowing an increase in the sensitivity of the features to cases with damage. The MD, denoted here as DI, is calculated for each simulation using the followingin which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−], and ¯ x is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The MD is calculated for each sensor and for each simulation, obtaining a matrix of n distances per k number of sensors.Finally, the discrimination of the features consists in distinguishing the features as corresponding to a healthy or damaged case. At this stage of the methodology, an analysis of\nabnormal values is carried out, which will allow the condition of the train wheels to beautomatically monitored and these values to be classified into different classes. This phaseThe outlier analysis consists of grouping, by probabilistic distribution processes, the datato the previously created group. For this, a statistical confidence limit (CB) is used, based on the inverse cumulative Gaussian distribution function (ICDF), considering the mean\nvalue, ¯ μ, and standard deviation, σ, of the baseline feature vector.Whenever a value of a DI indicator is equal to or greater than CB, it is considered an outlier (the null hypothesis is rejected), thus representing a case of damage.For feature classification, a clustering process is used to divide the dataset into distinct clusters that should be as compact and separated as possible . For clustering, the k-meanson the distances of their vectors. Recent studies showed that the k-means algorithm has shown promising results . The main limitation of this technique is that it requires\nknowledge of the number of clusters in advance. For this purpose, the global silhouetteThis section presents the main results obtained through the application of the methodology proposed in section 3 to the calculated track responses. The methodology is applied using damaged wheel passages for the three simulated train speeds (60, 80 and 100 km/h),hyperparameters (presented in section 3). By adjusting these hyperparameters, it is possible to make the algorithm more efficient and improve the generalisation capabilities, as only\nthe most important features are retained. The optimisation of these hyperparameters isof data under analysis. Based on the principles of the SAE already outlined in other works\nIn the context of this study, the non-linear transfer functions (logsig) proved to be more effective than the linear ones, being the ones used in all the studied cases. After analysing Table 3, there is a similarity in the hyperparameters when comparing the two types of OOR damage. It is observed that the data compression level is the same for both cases, around\n93%, as 500 features are extracted in Bottleneck 2 from the initial input data with 7000\nConcerning the type of damage situation, the size of the ‘Bottleneck 1’ and ‘Bottleneck\n2’ was increased to bring them even closer to the initial amount of input data. This can beanalysis, making it challenging for the autoencoder to define relationships between the data, hence requiring a larger number. On the contrary, the maximum number of epochsIt is also important to emphasise that of the various hyperparameters presented, theOnce the hyperparameters have been defined, all the steps of the methodology are applied to the new dataset. For simplicity, in this section, only the last phase of the methodology will be presented, namely an outlier analysis for damage detection and cluster analysis for damage classification. For each sensor, a matrix n × m is created, where n\nis the number of test passages (baseline scenarios + damage scenarios), and m represents the number of extracted features. So, the size of the matrices is 210 × 2000 in case of the\ntype of damage, 75 × 500 for each amplitude in polygonal wheel, and 120 × 500 for wheelDespite the visual distinction between healthy and damaged wheels based on the data processing presented in subsection 3.2, unsupervised learning must use strategies capable of automatically detecting damage. To this end, an outlier analysis is employed, which consists of defining a confidence threshold using a significance level of 1% , represented**Figure 10.** Automatic OOR damage detection based on outlier analysis.by the green line in Figure 10. This approach makes it possible to successfully detect allTo distinguish the two types of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed. Figure 11\nshows a clear distinction between the damage, even when using a dataset with three different train speeds (60,80 and 100 km/h).. In the case of Figure 11a), using all four\naccelerometers, it is possible to efficiently separate the set into two large clusters, despite\n30 misclassifications (16 in the polygonisation and 14 in the flats). Even so, the accuracy\npercentage is around 85%, which is a very good result. To analyse the sensitivity to the number of sensors, only two sensors were used, one on each side ). The results\nimproved, with a decrease in the number of misclassifications from 30 to 21 (13 for polygonisation and 8 for flats). One explanation could be the disparity in sensor sensitivity to the damage, where some sensors are more sensitive than others due to their spatial positioning in relation to the damage. By merging the data from the less sensitive sensors with the\nmore sensitive ones, this could have a negative impact on the results. Thus, the percentage\nThe purpose behind presenting these two plots was to demonstrate that, whether using 4 sensors or 2 sensors, the classification remains remarkably robust, showing lowAfter identifying the type of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed once again to\nclassify the severity of each damage separately. Regarding polygonal wheels, the classification involves both amplitude and harmonic orders, leading to the clusters depicted in the obtained clusters reasonably reflect the two amplitude groups, with all misclassifications associated with the H6-8 harmonic cases (17 misclassifications). Once the amplitude\nis identified, harmonic classification must be carried out separately for each of the amplitudes. In Figure 12b), related to amplitude A1, it is observed that the obtained clusters**Figure 11.** Automatic OOR damage classification based on cluster analysis using: a) 4 sensors; b) 2are nearly perfect, with only 3 misclassifications. In Figure 12c), there are only 3 misclassifications, totalling 8 misclassifications in the classification of the number of dominant\nThe classification of harmonic order is only possible with the separation of amplitudes,\nFigure 13 presents the clusters obtained for the wheel flat cases. The separation between\nthe less severe group and baseline cases and intermediate (cluster 3) and severe cases (cluster 4) is reduced, resulting in a total of 19 misclassifications. Nevertheless, this result showsrate of about 84%. One possible reason for this significant number of misclassifications could be directly associated with the number of impacts captured by the sensor.In order to contribute to the safety of railway transportation and service quality, an automatic methodology based on machine learning has been proposed. This methodology can accurately detect and classify two types of OOR wheel damage in railway vehicles allowing to mitigate problems at both track and vehicle level, such as derailments or material\ndegradation. It includes a new technique for feature extraction based on a dedicated neural network, the Sparse Autoencoder. This non-linear technique is an upgrade concerning the commonly used linear techniques for feature extraction since it allows a better normalisation of the operational effects in the analysed data, as well as the reduction of large amounts\nof data without relying on other techniques, while keeping the most valuable information. These improvements are achieved through the use of different hyperparameters in**Figure 12.** Automatic classification of polygonal wheels based on cluster analysis: a) amplitude A1-A2;**Figure 13.** Automatic classification of wheel flats based on cluster analysis.the calculations, such as non-linear activation functions and sparsity terms. Consequently,circulation. Particularly in the railway engineering field, the inclusion of this technique\nshowed a good potential to deal with variable train speeds, essentially due to the amplifying effect on the measured track dynamic responses which could induce errors in damage The application of the methodology to the data set proved to be very successful in detecting and classifying the two types of OOR damages. Damage detection was perfect, without\nany false detection. In terms of classifying the type of damage, the results are very good,\nwith a success rate of around 85%, but if only two accelerometers are considered the successrate increases to around 90%. These results are encouraging since the range of speeds considered in the analysis, between 60 and 100 km/h, is the most representative of in-service\nfreight trains. Also, the results show that including the Sparse Autoencoder has a positive\neffect in the normalization of the train speed in the damage data set.\nRegarding the severity classification for each type of damage, the methodology proved equally successful in clustering the different damage severities. For polygonal wheels, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the severity groups in terms of defect amplitude, failing only for the H6-8 harmonic cases, and in terms of harmonic orders for each amplitude,\nwith almost perfect results. For wheel flats, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the three severity groups, though with some misclassifications between the less severe group\nand baseline cases and between intermediate and severe cases. A success rate of around 86%\nis achieved in the classification of polygonal wheel severities and 84% in the classification of wheel flat severities. Even so, these high success rates of over 80% show the robustness\nof this methodology in damage classification regardless of the train speed.on on-site measurements. Additionally, this methodology could be carried out for other types of railway vehicles, for example, passenger vehicles, since the dynamic responses are\ndifferent from freight vehicles. In that case, exploring other recent types of autoencoders,\nTo increase the complexity of the problem, the objective is to explore the concept of\nmultiple damages (same or different OOR types). For this, it will be necessary to incorporate a new stage in the methodology, the damage location stage, which will make it possible\nto distinguish isolated damage from multiple damage, as well as their respective location.\nThus, damage will be identified using cut signals, which will then be used to classify theThis work is a result of project WAY4SafeRail-WAYside monitoring system FOR SAFE RAIL transportation, with reference NORTE-01-0247-FEDER-069595, co-funded by the European Regional\nDevelopment Fund (ERDF), through the North Portugal Regional Operational Programme\nPartnership Agreement.

Within this context,\nan unsupervised methodology based on artificial intelligence techniques is presented, which allows the detection and classification of wheels, based on dynamic responses induced on the track by crossing freight railway vehicles. The methodology involves the following\nsteps: (i) data collection and pre-processing, (ii) feature extraction (iii)\ndata fusion and (iv) feature discrimination. In the first phase, an FFT\nalgorithm is applied to the acceleration track responses. Then, features are extracted after training a Stacked Sparse Autoencoder, in which the main features of the responses are obtained after a compression stage using an encoder network. This lower dimensional\nlayer forces the model to learn a compression of the input data. Then,\nwhich enhances the sensitivity to the damage recognition. Posteriorly, an outlier analysis is performed to distinguish a healthy wheelRail vehicle wheels are subjected to constant wear and tear due to continuous use and inadequate maintenance plans. Over time, this wear and tear can generate more significant defects, so it is extremely important to use sensing to understand when maintenance of both the track and rolling stock is required.

However, this type of system entail high costs envisaging the vehicle wheel condition monitoring, since sensors need to be installed in every vehicle in order to achieve a good representativity . On the other hand, wayside systems are a more viable solution for identifying wheel defects, since the condition of allThe most common wheel defects are known as OOR. As the name infers, this defect is related to deformations on the surface of the wheel circumference that make it not round.\nThis deformation can have many forms and different causes, leading to faults on the vehicle and on the track due to the higher dynamic force values [4–6]. The OOR damagesa function of their shape and size, vehicle characteristics and speed [7–10]. Wheel flats induce high dynamic impact loads on the railway infrastructure, which causes significant damage to both tracks and vehicles, such as broken axles, damaged rolling bearings and cracks in the wheels, rails and sleepers . Moreover, it also generates high vibrations\ntransmitted to the rolling stock, inducing significant stresses and causing damage to the In the case of polygonal wheels, the formation mechanism can be roughly classified\ninto three categories, namely, (1) initial wheel defects , (2) a natural vibration of the\nvehicle–track system and (3) thermoelastic instability . The formation mechanism is strongly contingent on the vehicle type and its operational characteristics, withof dominant harmonic orders [19–22]. For example, Tao et al. studied asymmetrical polygonal wear on metro wheels and obtained harmonic orders of 12–14, while another study by Tao et al. found that the most common harmonic order in Chinese freight trains is 18–19. Although a polygonal wheel could generate less impact on the track than a\nwheel flat, this defect can cause serious damage to the track due to resonance effects in the\nTo identify the occurrence of these OOR anomalies in train wheels, innovative\nmethodologies have been developed combining signal processing and automatic learning techniques. These methodologies are based on the extraction of damage sensitivity features, making possible the distinction between undamaged and damaged situations. Recently, many studies have shown good results in detecting OOR damages using\ndistinct approaches [24–29]. Mishra et al. concluded that a single FBG (Fiber Bragg Grating) sensor, positioned along the rail can detect the presence of wheel flats.\nLourenço et al. created an automatic algorithm for diagnosing OOR defects. The\nproposed methodology consists of isolating specific defective wheels and then identifying the severity of the damage, using only acceleration and strain data measured on\nthe track. In another study, Krummenacher et al. , proposed two machine-learningBy extracting the features, it is possible to transform the measured data into an alternative form of information where the correlation with damage is more easily observed. There are various techniques for feature extraction, the most common being CWT\n(continuous wavelet transform) [31–33], PCA (principal component analysis) ,detection of polygonal wheels on freight vehicles using CWT and ARX features, using\n6 accelerometers, 3 on each side of the railway track. Mosleh et al. introduced aflats by extracting AR features from acceleration records. Moreover, Mohammadi et al.\nadopted linear features, particularly, CWT, PCA, ARX and AR, and their research findingsin the context of wheel flat damage detection. Although these studies have demonstrated robust results in detection, they show some limitations in dealing with the non-linear effects associated with operational effects, such as the train speed. Due to the inability of these linear techniques to attenuate operation effects, the inclusion of different speeds\nFor most of these studies, a feature normalisation stage is used when it is necessary to remove the operational effects. Usually, latent variable methods are used, such as PCA or multiple linear regression (MLR) . Thus, to deal with the non-linear phenomena and reduce the large amounts of data without relying on the aforementioned methods,\nthe first artificial neural networks were created to inherently execute this task . Over the years, new and more advanced networks have been developed, with the Autoencoder\n(AE) being one of the main types. Later, Olshausen et al. proposed the creation of\nsparse coding and Ng et al. introduced a sparse penalisation term in the hidden layer,\nto acquire more compact and effective features from lower-dimensional data. For some datasets with complex relationships between characteristics, employing more than one SAE\nis necessary, which is why stacked sparse autoencoders (SSAE) are commonly used .\nNowadays, these types of AE are widely used in various scientific fields, but specifically\nfor structural engineering only a few studies are found, and most are about damage detection on bridges [45–47]. Amaral et al. , proposed an approach for detecting structural anomalies based on SAE and Shewhart’s T control chart. The characteristics extracted byin structures. In another similar study, Amaral et al. , applied the same approach to\na numerical model of a highway viaduct in Brazil reaching more than 99% of successful classifications of structural damage with the combination of SAE and Support Vector Machine. Pathirage et al. proposed a framework utilizing SAE’s potential for dimensionality reduction, which facilitated the assessment of damage detection performance on Many of these AE algorithms already performed feature classification in order to discriminate the different types of damages and severities. However, the AE methods can also be combined with other techniques commonly used to classify the data. They can be used unsupervised methods, in which the model is trained without any labels provided to the\ntraining dataset, such as k-means , self-organising maps (SOM) , isolation forest, gaussian mixture model , k-medoids and cluster analysis , or supervised\nmethods, which assume that the hierarchy of database categories is known, such as NaiveBayes classifiers , k-Nearest Neighbours classifiers , Support Vector Machinetwo types of OOR damages, flats and polygonal wheels, based on acceleration responses obtained from a virtual wayside monitoring system.

The application of sensors on both sides of theTo obtain the responses from the railway track, it is necessary to apply sensors on the track that can measure the dynamic responses of the crossing trains. As it is not always possible\nto install them due to the high costs involved, simulations have been carried out based on calibrated models of the track , vehicle and considering their dynamic interaction,\nas well as including the track irregularities. Simulations include cases with healthy wheelsTo simulate the dynamic interactions between the vehicle and the track, an in-house software VSI – Vehicle-Structure Interaction Analysis is used, which was initially developed by\nNeves et al. and later improved by Montenegro et al. .

Including the track irregularities directly in the constraint equations are beneficial since it avoids explicitly considering\nthem in the FEM model. Moreover, it also allows to include the wheel and OOR profiles as a periodic rail irregularity, simplifying the analysis. Thus, before starting the analysis, the\nVSI software imports track irregularities and OOR profiles from a MATLAB file, whichto the vertical and lateral irregularities in each rail in each respective position, and adds it to the constraint equations of the system throughout the dynamics analysis. Then, the\nsystem of dynamic equations is solved using the typical Newmark integration method.\nThe impact of track irregularity on wheel defect classification is significant, as a lower track quality tends to result in a higher likelihood of misclassification. A comprehensive\nexploration of this influence was previously undertaken by Mosleh et al. as documented in their research study . Hence, this study does not delve into the impact of track\nquality; rather, it primarily centres on the utilisation of AI-based methodologies for the detection and classification of wheel defects. For this, four different profiles are used, based\non European Standard EN 13848–2 . In this case, power spectral density (PSD) curvesFor OOR defects, several profiles are defined based on real measurements in representative profiles of the various severities. Subsequently, the structural matrices are imported\nMore details on track and train properties, including additional information on traintrack interaction, can be found in previous publications . Figure 1 shows the\nvehicle–track interaction model schematisation and some details about the train and track\nsubsystems, as well as the track irregularities and wheel-rail contact model.According to the conclusions reached in other studies with this type of damage ,\nthe most promising location of the sensors is on the rail. To reduce installation and maintenance costs, it is important to reduce the number of sensors without compromising the\nquality of the results. Therefore, based on a sensitivity analysis performed during the study,\nonly two vertical unidirectional accelerometers were used on each rail, 4 in total (A1 to A4),\nsince they provided a higher cost–benefit ratio. These sensors are mounted on the rail atdefects, different simulation scenarios with perfect wheels (baseline) and OOR wheels\n(damage) were defined for a five-wagon Laagrss freight train. Based on different crossing speeds, loading schemes and rail irregularities profiles, 120 baseline and 180 damage scenarios (90 for polygonal wheels and 90 for wheel flats) were defined, as summarised in For baseline scenarios, six loading schemes with five different speeds (40, 60, 80, 100\nand 120 km/h) and four rail irregularity profiles were considered, giving a total of 120 scenarios. The loading schemes used are: empty, half-loaded, full-loaded and, additionally,For the damage cases, a total of 90 scenarios were generated for polygonal wheels. These\nscenarios including 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (H1, H2 and H3) x 10 different irregularity profiles within each specified harmonic interval. In these 10 irregularity\nprofiles, based on the defect amplitude, two amplitudes are considered, five simulations for\nA1 and five simulations for A2. Similarly, 90 scenarios were created for wheel flats, involving 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (F1, F2 and F3) x 10 different irregularitywheel radius . This wave phenomenon can be characterised by the different wavelengths formed (harmonics θ ), and by the levels of irregularity ( Lw ) associated with each of the harmonics. According to Peng , it is considered a polygonal wheel when the wear amplitude assumes values above 0. mm and wavelengths between 140 mm and the wheelTo define scenarios with polygonal wheels for the Laagrss wagon, a literature survey on\nexperimental measurements in defective wheels was conducted . Three experimental irregularity profiles were collected, illustrated in Figure 3. The first group (H6-8)\ncorresponds to a study carried out by Cai et al. with dominant harmonics from 6 to 8;**Figure 3.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) of polygonal wheels with**Figure 4.** Examples of polygonal damage profiles for each of the dominant harmonic intervals.the second group (H12-14) to a study authored by Tao et al. with dominant harmonics from 12 to 14; and the third profile (H17-18) to a study performed by Wu et al. with\nBased on the wheel irregularity spectra ( Lw ) taken from the respective measurement profiles, shown in Figure 3, and considering the contribution of the first 30 harmonics, several irregularity profiles were generated, according to Figure 4.

After obtaining the acceleration measurements from the numerical simulations, an FFT algorithm is applied to the time series allowing the conversion of the signal from the time domain to the frequency domain. Then,predefined hyperparameters of the algorithm. The set hyperparameters are encoding and\ndecoding transfer functions, hidden layer size, maximum number of epochs, L2 weight regularisation term, sparsity regularisation term and a sparsity proportion term. Afterwards,**Figure 7.** Flowchart with the main phases of the methodology for detection and classification of OORthe features are extracted in the more compressed layer of the SAE, the so-called bottleneck layer. The number of features obtained is equal to the number of hidden layers which\nis usually considerably lower than the data size, allowing a compression of the input data.\nFurthermore, to enhance the sensitivity to damage, two levels of data fusion are applied to the bottleneck features using the Mahalanobis distance. In the first level, all features are\nfused into a damage index (DI) for each sensor and, in the second level, all the sensors\nare merged resulting in only one DI for each simulation. Finally, automatic damage detection is achieved by performing an outlier analysis, in which a statistical confidence limit\n(CB) is used, based on the Inverse Cumulative Gaussian Distribution Function (ICDF).\nFor feature classification, an automatic clustering process based on the k-means technique is implemented. This algorithm allows for the unsupervised and automatic classification of data, based on the calculation of statistical distances between objects. In k-means technique given a vector of data and chosen k clusters, the key is to find k centroids that minimise\nthe distance of each vector to its nearest centroid . Since it is necessary to define the number of clusters in advance, a global Silhouette index (SIL) was adopted to make\nan automatic process. At the end, the clusters will allow the classification of the two typesbetween the number of correct classifications and the total number of cases.damage detection problems, as it allows a signal to be converted from the time domain to the frequency domain, to capture the excitation frequencies induced by the wheel defects.\nIn addition, a data reduction is carried out at this stage, since the initial records contain aa crossing speed of 80 km/h. When comparing the FFT spectra for a train passage with flats, Figure 8a), with polygonal wheels, Figure 8b), there are visible differences in terms\nof amplitude peak values and excited frequency ranges. For flats, the amplitude peak values are higher and they induce frequencies in the range between DC and 1500accordance with some authors reports . In terms of severities, for flats, the more severe group (55–100 mm) is the one with the higher frequency content, as expected,a baseline response. For polygonal wheels, from the analysis of Figure 8b), it can be seen the frequency peaks for the H12–14 and H17–18 profiles around 100 and 150\nrespectively, while for the profile H6-8 a more flat spectrum is obtained without showing any significant peak. This can be explained by the irregularity level profile of thisThese two graphs can show which frequencies have higher content in the original signal.Autoencoders are artificial neural networks trained using an unsupervised approach,\nwhich aim first to learn coded representations of the data, compressing the input into\na latent space representation, and second, through this compressed information, reconstructing the information. The basic architecture of this type of network consists of threewhere **Wij**, **Wjk** are the weights connection matrices between input layer-hidden\nlayer and hidden layer-output layer, **X** = ( **X** 1, **X** 2, . . ., **Xn** ) is the input data vector,\n**H** = ( **H** 1, . . ., **Hm** ) is the low-dimensional vector and **X** [ˆ] = ( **X** [ˆ] 1, **X** [ˆ] 2, . . ., **X** [ˆ] **n** ) is the output**Figure 8.** Frequency domain responses on position 1 for the crossing speed of 80 km/h: (a) wheel flats,data vector. **b** 1, **b** 2 are bias vectors and σ 1, σ 2 are the activation function used in each of thereconstruction of the input X [ˆ], as shown in Equation (3).

After incorporating various inputs into the SSAE training, they are integrated into the so-called\n‘Input 1’. As training progresses, the data is compressed, and the main characteristics of the signals are obtained and retained in ‘Bottleneck 1’. Subsequently, these characteristics are\nused as input for training the second sparse autoencoder, which, after further compression,\nenables the extraction of the final features. Depending on the type of data under analysis,\nthe compression level differs, so multiple tests should be conducted to optimise these layer sizes. This optimisation was achieved by trial and test, changing both the size of the first\nIt should be noted that this network architecture, where the dimensions of the layers gradually decrease along the network until reaching the bottleneck layer , has proven\nto be highly robust for the type of data used. It allows for effective compression of results**Figure 9.** Schematic of the structure of the SSAE neural network used in this study.After extracting the features from the bottleneck layer of the SSAE, the difference between the healthy wheels scenarios and the damage wheels scenarios is still not sufficient. Hence\na data fusion is performed. With this fusion, it is possible to increase the sensitivity of the\nfeatures, and as a result, to obtain a damage index (DI) for each simulation. Thus, the Mahalanobis distance (MD) is used to reduce the volume of extracted data and preserve the most relevant information . Briefly, MD is a metric that measures the distance between two points in a feature space consisting of two or more variables, being independent of the\nscale of the features, thus allowing an increase in the sensitivity of the features to cases with damage. The MD, denoted here as DI, is calculated for each simulation using the followingin which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−], and ¯ x is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The MD is calculated for each sensor and for each simulation, obtaining a matrix of n distances per k number of sensors.Finally, the discrimination of the features consists in distinguishing the features as corresponding to a healthy or damaged case. At this stage of the methodology, an analysis of\nabnormal values is carried out, which will allow the condition of the train wheels to beautomatically monitored and these values to be classified into different classes. This phaseThe outlier analysis consists of grouping, by probabilistic distribution processes, the datato the previously created group. For this, a statistical confidence limit (CB) is used, based on the inverse cumulative Gaussian distribution function (ICDF), considering the mean\nvalue, ¯ μ, and standard deviation, σ, of the baseline feature vector.Whenever a value of a DI indicator is equal to or greater than CB, it is considered an outlier (the null hypothesis is rejected), thus representing a case of damage.For feature classification, a clustering process is used to divide the dataset into distinct clusters that should be as compact and separated as possible . For clustering, the k-meanson the distances of their vectors. Recent studies showed that the k-means algorithm has shown promising results . The main limitation of this technique is that it requires\nknowledge of the number of clusters in advance. For this purpose, the global silhouetteThis section presents the main results obtained through the application of the methodology proposed in section 3 to the calculated track responses. The methodology is applied using damaged wheel passages for the three simulated train speeds (60, 80 and 100 km/h),hyperparameters (presented in section 3). By adjusting these hyperparameters, it is possible to make the algorithm more efficient and improve the generalisation capabilities, as only\nthe most important features are retained. The optimisation of these hyperparameters isof data under analysis. Based on the principles of the SAE already outlined in other works\nIn the context of this study, the non-linear transfer functions (logsig) proved to be more effective than the linear ones, being the ones used in all the studied cases. After analysing Table 3, there is a similarity in the hyperparameters when comparing the two types of OOR damage. It is observed that the data compression level is the same for both cases, around\n93%, as 500 features are extracted in Bottleneck 2 from the initial input data with 7000\nConcerning the type of damage situation, the size of the ‘Bottleneck 1’ and ‘Bottleneck\n2’ was increased to bring them even closer to the initial amount of input data. This can beanalysis, making it challenging for the autoencoder to define relationships between the data, hence requiring a larger number. On the contrary, the maximum number of epochsIt is also important to emphasise that of the various hyperparameters presented, theOnce the hyperparameters have been defined, all the steps of the methodology are applied to the new dataset. For simplicity, in this section, only the last phase of the methodology will be presented, namely an outlier analysis for damage detection and cluster analysis for damage classification. For each sensor, a matrix n × m is created, where n\nis the number of test passages (baseline scenarios + damage scenarios), and m represents the number of extracted features. So, the size of the matrices is 210 × 2000 in case of the\ntype of damage, 75 × 500 for each amplitude in polygonal wheel, and 120 × 500 for wheelDespite the visual distinction between healthy and damaged wheels based on the data processing presented in subsection 3.2, unsupervised learning must use strategies capable of automatically detecting damage. To this end, an outlier analysis is employed, which consists of defining a confidence threshold using a significance level of 1% , represented**Figure 10.** Automatic OOR damage detection based on outlier analysis.by the green line in Figure 10. This approach makes it possible to successfully detect allTo distinguish the two types of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed. Figure 11\nshows a clear distinction between the damage, even when using a dataset with three different train speeds (60,80 and 100 km/h).. In the case of Figure 11a), using all four\naccelerometers, it is possible to efficiently separate the set into two large clusters, despite\n30 misclassifications (16 in the polygonisation and 14 in the flats). Even so, the accuracy\npercentage is around 85%, which is a very good result. To analyse the sensitivity to the number of sensors, only two sensors were used, one on each side ). The results\nimproved, with a decrease in the number of misclassifications from 30 to 21 (13 for polygonisation and 8 for flats). One explanation could be the disparity in sensor sensitivity to the damage, where some sensors are more sensitive than others due to their spatial positioning in relation to the damage. By merging the data from the less sensitive sensors with the\nmore sensitive ones, this could have a negative impact on the results. Thus, the percentage\nThe purpose behind presenting these two plots was to demonstrate that, whether using 4 sensors or 2 sensors, the classification remains remarkably robust, showing lowAfter identifying the type of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed once again to\nclassify the severity of each damage separately. Regarding polygonal wheels, the classification involves both amplitude and harmonic orders, leading to the clusters depicted in the obtained clusters reasonably reflect the two amplitude groups, with all misclassifications associated with the H6-8 harmonic cases (17 misclassifications). Once the amplitude\nis identified, harmonic classification must be carried out separately for each of the amplitudes. In Figure 12b), related to amplitude A1, it is observed that the obtained clusters**Figure 11.** Automatic OOR damage classification based on cluster analysis using: a) 4 sensors; b) 2are nearly perfect, with only 3 misclassifications. In Figure 12c), there are only 3 misclassifications, totalling 8 misclassifications in the classification of the number of dominant\nThe classification of harmonic order is only possible with the separation of amplitudes,\nFigure 13 presents the clusters obtained for the wheel flat cases. The separation between\nthe less severe group and baseline cases and intermediate (cluster 3) and severe cases (cluster 4) is reduced, resulting in a total of 19 misclassifications. Nevertheless, this result showsrate of about 84%. One possible reason for this significant number of misclassifications could be directly associated with the number of impacts captured by the sensor.In order to contribute to the safety of railway transportation and service quality, an automatic methodology based on machine learning has been proposed. This methodology can accurately detect and classify two types of OOR wheel damage in railway vehicles allowing to mitigate problems at both track and vehicle level, such as derailments or material\ndegradation. It includes a new technique for feature extraction based on a dedicated neural network, the Sparse Autoencoder. This non-linear technique is an upgrade concerning the commonly used linear techniques for feature extraction since it allows a better normalisation of the operational effects in the analysed data, as well as the reduction of large amounts\nof data without relying on other techniques, while keeping the most valuable information. These improvements are achieved through the use of different hyperparameters in**Figure 12.** Automatic classification of polygonal wheels based on cluster analysis: a) amplitude A1-A2;**Figure 13.** Automatic classification of wheel flats based on cluster analysis.the calculations, such as non-linear activation functions and sparsity terms. Consequently,circulation. Particularly in the railway engineering field, the inclusion of this technique\nshowed a good potential to deal with variable train speeds, essentially due to the amplifying effect on the measured track dynamic responses which could induce errors in damage The application of the methodology to the data set proved to be very successful in detecting and classifying the two types of OOR damages. Damage detection was perfect, without\nany false detection. In terms of classifying the type of damage, the results are very good,\nwith a success rate of around 85%, but if only two accelerometers are considered the successrate increases to around 90%. These results are encouraging since the range of speeds considered in the analysis, between 60 and 100 km/h, is the most representative of in-service\nfreight trains. Also, the results show that including the Sparse Autoencoder has a positive\neffect in the normalization of the train speed in the damage data set.\nRegarding the severity classification for each type of damage, the methodology proved equally successful in clustering the different damage severities. For polygonal wheels, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the severity groups in terms of defect amplitude, failing only for the H6-8 harmonic cases, and in terms of harmonic orders for each amplitude,\nwith almost perfect results. For wheel flats, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the three severity groups, though with some misclassifications between the less severe group\nand baseline cases and between intermediate and severe cases. A success rate of around 86%\nis achieved in the classification of polygonal wheel severities and 84% in the classification of wheel flat severities. Even so, these high success rates of over 80% show the robustness\nof this methodology in damage classification regardless of the train speed.on on-site measurements. Additionally, this methodology could be carried out for other types of railway vehicles, for example, passenger vehicles, since the dynamic responses are\ndifferent from freight vehicles. In that case, exploring other recent types of autoencoders,\nTo increase the complexity of the problem, the objective is to explore the concept of\nmultiple damages (same or different OOR types). For this, it will be necessary to incorporate a new stage in the methodology, the damage location stage, which will make it possible\nto distinguish isolated damage from multiple damage, as well as their respective location.\nThus, damage will be identified using cut signals, which will then be used to classify theThis work is a result of project WAY4SafeRail-WAYside monitoring system FOR SAFE RAIL transportation, with reference NORTE-01-0247-FEDER-069595, co-funded by the European Regional\nDevelopment Fund (ERDF), through the North Portugal Regional Operational Programme\nPartnership Agreement.

Within this context,\nan unsupervised methodology based on artificial intelligence techniques is presented, which allows the detection and classification of wheels, based on dynamic responses induced on the track by crossing freight railway vehicles. The methodology involves the following\nsteps: (i) data collection and pre-processing, (ii) feature extraction (iii)\ndata fusion and (iv) feature discrimination. In the first phase, an FFT\nalgorithm is applied to the acceleration track responses. Then, features are extracted after training a Stacked Sparse Autoencoder, in which the main features of the responses are obtained after a compression stage using an encoder network. This lower dimensional\nlayer forces the model to learn a compression of the input data. Then,\nwhich enhances the sensitivity to the damage recognition. Posteriorly, an outlier analysis is performed to distinguish a healthy wheelRail vehicle wheels are subjected to constant wear and tear due to continuous use and inadequate maintenance plans. Over time, this wear and tear can generate more significant defects, so it is extremely important to use sensing to understand when maintenance of both the track and rolling stock is required.

However, this type of system entail high costs envisaging the vehicle wheel condition monitoring, since sensors need to be installed in every vehicle in order to achieve a good representativity . On the other hand, wayside systems are a more viable solution for identifying wheel defects, since the condition of allThe most common wheel defects are known as OOR. As the name infers, this defect is related to deformations on the surface of the wheel circumference that make it not round.\nThis deformation can have many forms and different causes, leading to faults on the vehicle and on the track due to the higher dynamic force values [4–6]. The OOR damagesa function of their shape and size, vehicle characteristics and speed [7–10]. Wheel flats induce high dynamic impact loads on the railway infrastructure, which causes significant damage to both tracks and vehicles, such as broken axles, damaged rolling bearings and cracks in the wheels, rails and sleepers . Moreover, it also generates high vibrations\ntransmitted to the rolling stock, inducing significant stresses and causing damage to the In the case of polygonal wheels, the formation mechanism can be roughly classified\ninto three categories, namely, (1) initial wheel defects , (2) a natural vibration of the\nvehicle–track system and (3) thermoelastic instability . The formation mechanism is strongly contingent on the vehicle type and its operational characteristics, withof dominant harmonic orders [19–22]. For example, Tao et al. studied asymmetrical polygonal wear on metro wheels and obtained harmonic orders of 12–14, while another study by Tao et al. found that the most common harmonic order in Chinese freight trains is 18–19. Although a polygonal wheel could generate less impact on the track than a\nwheel flat, this defect can cause serious damage to the track due to resonance effects in the\nTo identify the occurrence of these OOR anomalies in train wheels, innovative\nmethodologies have been developed combining signal processing and automatic learning techniques. These methodologies are based on the extraction of damage sensitivity features, making possible the distinction between undamaged and damaged situations. Recently, many studies have shown good results in detecting OOR damages using\ndistinct approaches [24–29]. Mishra et al. concluded that a single FBG (Fiber Bragg Grating) sensor, positioned along the rail can detect the presence of wheel flats.\nLourenço et al. created an automatic algorithm for diagnosing OOR defects. The\nproposed methodology consists of isolating specific defective wheels and then identifying the severity of the damage, using only acceleration and strain data measured on\nthe track. In another study, Krummenacher et al. , proposed two machine-learningBy extracting the features, it is possible to transform the measured data into an alternative form of information where the correlation with damage is more easily observed. There are various techniques for feature extraction, the most common being CWT\n(continuous wavelet transform) [31–33], PCA (principal component analysis) ,detection of polygonal wheels on freight vehicles using CWT and ARX features, using\n6 accelerometers, 3 on each side of the railway track. Mosleh et al. introduced aflats by extracting AR features from acceleration records. Moreover, Mohammadi et al.\nadopted linear features, particularly, CWT, PCA, ARX and AR, and their research findingsin the context of wheel flat damage detection. Although these studies have demonstrated robust results in detection, they show some limitations in dealing with the non-linear effects associated with operational effects, such as the train speed. Due to the inability of these linear techniques to attenuate operation effects, the inclusion of different speeds\nFor most of these studies, a feature normalisation stage is used when it is necessary to remove the operational effects. Usually, latent variable methods are used, such as PCA or multiple linear regression (MLR) . Thus, to deal with the non-linear phenomena and reduce the large amounts of data without relying on the aforementioned methods,\nthe first artificial neural networks were created to inherently execute this task . Over the years, new and more advanced networks have been developed, with the Autoencoder\n(AE) being one of the main types. Later, Olshausen et al. proposed the creation of\nsparse coding and Ng et al. introduced a sparse penalisation term in the hidden layer,\nto acquire more compact and effective features from lower-dimensional data. For some datasets with complex relationships between characteristics, employing more than one SAE\nis necessary, which is why stacked sparse autoencoders (SSAE) are commonly used .\nNowadays, these types of AE are widely used in various scientific fields, but specifically\nfor structural engineering only a few studies are found, and most are about damage detection on bridges [45–47].

Pathirage et al. proposed a framework utilizing SAE’s potential for dimensionality reduction, which facilitated the assessment of damage detection performance on Many of these AE algorithms already performed feature classification in order to discriminate the different types of damages and severities. However, the AE methods can also be combined with other techniques commonly used to classify the data. They can be used unsupervised methods, in which the model is trained without any labels provided to the\ntraining dataset, such as k-means , self-organising maps (SOM) , isolation forest, gaussian mixture model , k-medoids and cluster analysis , or supervised\nmethods, which assume that the hierarchy of database categories is known, such as NaiveBayes classifiers , k-Nearest Neighbours classifiers , Support Vector Machinetwo types of OOR damages, flats and polygonal wheels, based on acceleration responses obtained from a virtual wayside monitoring system.

The application of sensors on both sides of theTo obtain the responses from the railway track, it is necessary to apply sensors on the track that can measure the dynamic responses of the crossing trains. As it is not always possible\nto install them due to the high costs involved, simulations have been carried out based on calibrated models of the track , vehicle and considering their dynamic interaction,\nas well as including the track irregularities. Simulations include cases with healthy wheelsTo simulate the dynamic interactions between the vehicle and the track, an in-house software VSI – Vehicle-Structure Interaction Analysis is used, which was initially developed by\nNeves et al. and later improved by Montenegro et al. .

These equations are solved\nalongside equilibrium equations, forming a unified system that couples the two subsystems\n. Including the track irregularities directly in the constraint equations are beneficial since it avoids explicitly considering\nthem in the FEM model. Moreover, it also allows to include the wheel and OOR profiles as a periodic rail irregularity, simplifying the analysis. Thus, before starting the analysis, the\nVSI software imports track irregularities and OOR profiles from a MATLAB file, whichto the vertical and lateral irregularities in each rail in each respective position, and adds it to the constraint equations of the system throughout the dynamics analysis. Then, the\nsystem of dynamic equations is solved using the typical Newmark integration method.\nThe impact of track irregularity on wheel defect classification is significant, as a lower track quality tends to result in a higher likelihood of misclassification. A comprehensive\nexploration of this influence was previously undertaken by Mosleh et al. as documented in their research study . Hence, this study does not delve into the impact of track\nquality; rather, it primarily centres on the utilisation of AI-based methodologies for the detection and classification of wheel defects. For this, four different profiles are used, based\non European Standard EN 13848–2 . In this case, power spectral density (PSD) curvesFor OOR defects, several profiles are defined based on real measurements in representative profiles of the various severities. Subsequently, the structural matrices are imported\nMore details on track and train properties, including additional information on traintrack interaction, can be found in previous publications . Figure 1 shows the\nvehicle–track interaction model schematisation and some details about the train and track\nsubsystems, as well as the track irregularities and wheel-rail contact model.According to the conclusions reached in other studies with this type of damage ,\nthe most promising location of the sensors is on the rail. To reduce installation and maintenance costs, it is important to reduce the number of sensors without compromising the\nquality of the results. Therefore, based on a sensitivity analysis performed during the study,\nonly two vertical unidirectional accelerometers were used on each rail, 4 in total (A1 to A4),\nsince they provided a higher cost–benefit ratio. These sensors are mounted on the rail atdefects, different simulation scenarios with perfect wheels (baseline) and OOR wheels\n(damage) were defined for a five-wagon Laagrss freight train. Based on different crossing speeds, loading schemes and rail irregularities profiles, 120 baseline and 180 damage scenarios (90 for polygonal wheels and 90 for wheel flats) were defined, as summarised in For baseline scenarios, six loading schemes with five different speeds (40, 60, 80, 100\nand 120 km/h) and four rail irregularity profiles were considered, giving a total of 120 scenarios. The loading schemes used are: empty, half-loaded, full-loaded and, additionally,For the damage cases, a total of 90 scenarios were generated for polygonal wheels. These\nscenarios including 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (H1, H2 and H3) x 10 different irregularity profiles within each specified harmonic interval. In these 10 irregularity\nprofiles, based on the defect amplitude, two amplitudes are considered, five simulations for\nA1 and five simulations for A2. Similarly, 90 scenarios were created for wheel flats, involving 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (F1, F2 and F3) x 10 different irregularitywheel radius . This wave phenomenon can be characterised by the different wavelengths formed (harmonics θ ), and by the levels of irregularity ( Lw ) associated with each of the harmonics. According to Peng , it is considered a polygonal wheel when the wear amplitude assumes values above 0. mm and wavelengths between 140 mm and the wheelTo define scenarios with polygonal wheels for the Laagrss wagon, a literature survey on\nexperimental measurements in defective wheels was conducted . Three experimental irregularity profiles were collected, illustrated in Figure 3. The first group (H6-8)\ncorresponds to a study carried out by Cai et al. with dominant harmonics from 6 to 8;**Figure 3.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) of polygonal wheels with**Figure 4.** Examples of polygonal damage profiles for each of the dominant harmonic intervals.the second group (H12-14) to a study authored by Tao et al. with dominant harmonics from 12 to 14; and the third profile (H17-18) to a study performed by Wu et al. with\nBased on the wheel irregularity spectra ( Lw ) taken from the respective measurement profiles, shown in Figure 3, and considering the contribution of the first 30 harmonics, several irregularity profiles were generated, according to Figure 4.

Then,predefined hyperparameters of the algorithm. The set hyperparameters are encoding and\ndecoding transfer functions, hidden layer size, maximum number of epochs, L2 weight regularisation term, sparsity regularisation term and a sparsity proportion term. Afterwards,**Figure 7.** Flowchart with the main phases of the methodology for detection and classification of OORthe features are extracted in the more compressed layer of the SAE, the so-called bottleneck layer. The number of features obtained is equal to the number of hidden layers which\nis usually considerably lower than the data size, allowing a compression of the input data.\nFurthermore, to enhance the sensitivity to damage, two levels of data fusion are applied to the bottleneck features using the Mahalanobis distance. In the first level, all features are\nfused into a damage index (DI) for each sensor and, in the second level, all the sensors\nare merged resulting in only one DI for each simulation. Finally, automatic damage detection is achieved by performing an outlier analysis, in which a statistical confidence limit\n(CB) is used, based on the Inverse Cumulative Gaussian Distribution Function (ICDF).\nFor feature classification, an automatic clustering process based on the k-means technique is implemented. This algorithm allows for the unsupervised and automatic classification of data, based on the calculation of statistical distances between objects. In k-means technique given a vector of data and chosen k clusters, the key is to find k centroids that minimise\nthe distance of each vector to its nearest centroid . Since it is necessary to define the number of clusters in advance, a global Silhouette index (SIL) was adopted to make\nan automatic process. At the end, the clusters will allow the classification of the two typesbetween the number of correct classifications and the total number of cases.damage detection problems, as it allows a signal to be converted from the time domain to the frequency domain, to capture the excitation frequencies induced by the wheel defects.\nIn addition, a data reduction is carried out at this stage, since the initial records contain aa crossing speed of 80 km/h. When comparing the FFT spectra for a train passage with flats, Figure 8a), with polygonal wheels, Figure 8b), there are visible differences in terms\nof amplitude peak values and excited frequency ranges. For flats, the amplitude peak values are higher and they induce frequencies in the range between DC and 1500accordance with some authors reports . In terms of severities, for flats, the more severe group (55–100 mm) is the one with the higher frequency content, as expected,a baseline response. For polygonal wheels, from the analysis of Figure 8b), it can be seen the frequency peaks for the H12–14 and H17–18 profiles around 100 and 150\nrespectively, while for the profile H6-8 a more flat spectrum is obtained without showing any significant peak. This can be explained by the irregularity level profile of thisThese two graphs can show which frequencies have higher content in the original signal.Autoencoders are artificial neural networks trained using an unsupervised approach,\nwhich aim first to learn coded representations of the data, compressing the input into\na latent space representation, and second, through this compressed information, reconstructing the information. The basic architecture of this type of network consists of threewhere **Wij**, **Wjk** are the weights connection matrices between input layer-hidden\nlayer and hidden layer-output layer, **X** = ( **X** 1, **X** 2, . . ., **Xn** ) is the input data vector,\n**H** = ( **H** 1, . . ., **Hm** ) is the low-dimensional vector and **X** [ˆ] = ( **X** [ˆ] 1, **X** [ˆ] 2, . . ., **X** [ˆ] **n** ) is the output**Figure 8.** Frequency domain responses on position 1 for the crossing speed of 80 km/h: (a) wheel flats,data vector. **b** 1, **b** 2 are bias vectors and σ 1, σ 2 are the activation function used in each of thereconstruction of the input X [ˆ], as shown in Equation (3). This function uses the meanIn the Sparse Autoencoder, to make the coding more efficient, two regularisation terms,\nsparse penalty term and weight regularisation term, are added to the error function, causing only a subset of neurons to be activated. The average activation of neurons in the hiddenAs the average activation ˆ ρ is intended to be close to a constant ρ (sparsity proportion)\nand it is usually a small positive number near 0, the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence isIn addition to this, a weight regularisation term, called L2 regularisation, is also addedwhere L is the number of hidden layers, nl the output size of layer l, kl the input size ofwhere μ is the coefficient for the L2 regularisation term and β the coefficient for the sparsityAfter data pre-processing, the acceleration responses in the frequency domain, are then In this work, two layers of SAE’s were used to form the network, as shown in Figure 9.layers, with the outputs of the previous autoencoder serving as input for the next one. After incorporating various inputs into the SSAE training, they are integrated into the so-called\n‘Input 1’. As training progresses, the data is compressed, and the main characteristics of the signals are obtained and retained in ‘Bottleneck 1’. Subsequently, these characteristics are\nused as input for training the second sparse autoencoder, which, after further compression,\nenables the extraction of the final features. Depending on the type of data under analysis,\nthe compression level differs, so multiple tests should be conducted to optimise these layer sizes. This optimisation was achieved by trial and test, changing both the size of the first\nIt should be noted that this network architecture, where the dimensions of the layers gradually decrease along the network until reaching the bottleneck layer , has proven\nto be highly robust for the type of data used. It allows for effective compression of results**Figure 9.** Schematic of the structure of the SSAE neural network used in this study.After extracting the features from the bottleneck layer of the SSAE, the difference between the healthy wheels scenarios and the damage wheels scenarios is still not sufficient. Hence\na data fusion is performed. With this fusion, it is possible to increase the sensitivity of the\nfeatures, and as a result, to obtain a damage index (DI) for each simulation. Thus, the Mahalanobis distance (MD) is used to reduce the volume of extracted data and preserve the most relevant information . Briefly, MD is a metric that measures the distance between two points in a feature space consisting of two or more variables, being independent of the\nscale of the features, thus allowing an increase in the sensitivity of the features to cases with damage. The MD, denoted here as DI, is calculated for each simulation using the followingin which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−], and ¯ x is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The MD is calculated for each sensor and for each simulation, obtaining a matrix of n distances per k number of sensors.Finally, the discrimination of the features consists in distinguishing the features as corresponding to a healthy or damaged case. At this stage of the methodology, an analysis of\nabnormal values is carried out, which will allow the condition of the train wheels to beautomatically monitored and these values to be classified into different classes. This phaseThe outlier analysis consists of grouping, by probabilistic distribution processes, the datato the previously created group. For this, a statistical confidence limit (CB) is used, based on the inverse cumulative Gaussian distribution function (ICDF), considering the mean\nvalue, ¯ μ, and standard deviation, σ, of the baseline feature vector.Whenever a value of a DI indicator is equal to or greater than CB, it is considered an outlier (the null hypothesis is rejected), thus representing a case of damage.For feature classification, a clustering process is used to divide the dataset into distinct clusters that should be as compact and separated as possible . For clustering, the k-meanson the distances of their vectors. Recent studies showed that the k-means algorithm has shown promising results . The main limitation of this technique is that it requires\nknowledge of the number of clusters in advance. For this purpose, the global silhouetteThis section presents the main results obtained through the application of the methodology proposed in section 3 to the calculated track responses. The methodology is applied using damaged wheel passages for the three simulated train speeds (60, 80 and 100 km/h),hyperparameters (presented in section 3). By adjusting these hyperparameters, it is possible to make the algorithm more efficient and improve the generalisation capabilities, as only\nthe most important features are retained. The optimisation of these hyperparameters isof data under analysis. Based on the principles of the SAE already outlined in other works\nIn the context of this study, the non-linear transfer functions (logsig) proved to be more effective than the linear ones, being the ones used in all the studied cases. After analysing Table 3, there is a similarity in the hyperparameters when comparing the two types of OOR damage. It is observed that the data compression level is the same for both cases, around\n93%, as 500 features are extracted in Bottleneck 2 from the initial input data with 7000\nConcerning the type of damage situation, the size of the ‘Bottleneck 1’ and ‘Bottleneck\n2’ was increased to bring them even closer to the initial amount of input data. This can beanalysis, making it challenging for the autoencoder to define relationships between the data, hence requiring a larger number. On the contrary, the maximum number of epochsIt is also important to emphasise that of the various hyperparameters presented, theOnce the hyperparameters have been defined, all the steps of the methodology are applied to the new dataset. For simplicity, in this section, only the last phase of the methodology will be presented, namely an outlier analysis for damage detection and cluster analysis for damage classification. For each sensor, a matrix n × m is created, where n\nis the number of test passages (baseline scenarios + damage scenarios), and m represents the number of extracted features. So, the size of the matrices is 210 × 2000 in case of the\ntype of damage, 75 × 500 for each amplitude in polygonal wheel, and 120 × 500 for wheelDespite the visual distinction between healthy and damaged wheels based on the data processing presented in subsection 3.2, unsupervised learning must use strategies capable of automatically detecting damage. To this end, an outlier analysis is employed, which consists of defining a confidence threshold using a significance level of 1% , represented**Figure 10.** Automatic OOR damage detection based on outlier analysis.by the green line in Figure 10. This approach makes it possible to successfully detect allTo distinguish the two types of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed. Figure 11\nshows a clear distinction between the damage, even when using a dataset with three different train speeds (60,80 and 100 km/h).. In the case of Figure 11a), using all four\naccelerometers, it is possible to efficiently separate the set into two large clusters, despite\n30 misclassifications (16 in the polygonisation and 14 in the flats). Even so, the accuracy\npercentage is around 85%, which is a very good result. To analyse the sensitivity to the number of sensors, only two sensors were used, one on each side ). The results\nimproved, with a decrease in the number of misclassifications from 30 to 21 (13 for polygonisation and 8 for flats). One explanation could be the disparity in sensor sensitivity to the damage, where some sensors are more sensitive than others due to their spatial positioning in relation to the damage. By merging the data from the less sensitive sensors with the\nmore sensitive ones, this could have a negative impact on the results. Thus, the percentage\nThe purpose behind presenting these two plots was to demonstrate that, whether using 4 sensors or 2 sensors, the classification remains remarkably robust, showing lowAfter identifying the type of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed once again to\nclassify the severity of each damage separately. Regarding polygonal wheels, the classification involves both amplitude and harmonic orders, leading to the clusters depicted in the obtained clusters reasonably reflect the two amplitude groups, with all misclassifications associated with the H6-8 harmonic cases (17 misclassifications). Once the amplitude\nis identified, harmonic classification must be carried out separately for each of the amplitudes. In Figure 12b), related to amplitude A1, it is observed that the obtained clusters**Figure 11.** Automatic OOR damage classification based on cluster analysis using: a) 4 sensors; b) 2are nearly perfect, with only 3 misclassifications. In Figure 12c), there are only 3 misclassifications, totalling 8 misclassifications in the classification of the number of dominant\nThe classification of harmonic order is only possible with the separation of amplitudes,\nFigure 13 presents the clusters obtained for the wheel flat cases. The separation between\nthe less severe group and baseline cases and intermediate (cluster 3) and severe cases (cluster 4) is reduced, resulting in a total of 19 misclassifications. Nevertheless, this result showsrate of about 84%. One possible reason for this significant number of misclassifications could be directly associated with the number of impacts captured by the sensor.In order to contribute to the safety of railway transportation and service quality, an automatic methodology based on machine learning has been proposed. This methodology can accurately detect and classify two types of OOR wheel damage in railway vehicles allowing to mitigate problems at both track and vehicle level, such as derailments or material\ndegradation. It includes a new technique for feature extraction based on a dedicated neural network, the Sparse Autoencoder. This non-linear technique is an upgrade concerning the commonly used linear techniques for feature extraction since it allows a better normalisation of the operational effects in the analysed data, as well as the reduction of large amounts\nof data without relying on other techniques, while keeping the most valuable information. These improvements are achieved through the use of different hyperparameters in**Figure 12.** Automatic classification of polygonal wheels based on cluster analysis: a) amplitude A1-A2;**Figure 13.** Automatic classification of wheel flats based on cluster analysis.the calculations, such as non-linear activation functions and sparsity terms. Consequently,circulation. Particularly in the railway engineering field, the inclusion of this technique\nshowed a good potential to deal with variable train speeds, essentially due to the amplifying effect on the measured track dynamic responses which could induce errors in damage The application of the methodology to the data set proved to be very successful in detecting and classifying the two types of OOR damages. Damage detection was perfect, without\nany false detection. In terms of classifying the type of damage, the results are very good,\nwith a success rate of around 85%, but if only two accelerometers are considered the successrate increases to around 90%. These results are encouraging since the range of speeds considered in the analysis, between 60 and 100 km/h, is the most representative of in-service\nfreight trains. Also, the results show that including the Sparse Autoencoder has a positive\neffect in the normalization of the train speed in the damage data set.\nRegarding the severity classification for each type of damage, the methodology proved equally successful in clustering the different damage severities. For polygonal wheels, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the severity groups in terms of defect amplitude, failing only for the H6-8 harmonic cases, and in terms of harmonic orders for each amplitude,\nwith almost perfect results. For wheel flats, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the three severity groups, though with some misclassifications between the less severe group\nand baseline cases and between intermediate and severe cases. A success rate of around 86%\nis achieved in the classification of polygonal wheel severities and 84% in the classification of wheel flat severities. Even so, these high success rates of over 80% show the robustness\nof this methodology in damage classification regardless of the train speed.on on-site measurements. Additionally, this methodology could be carried out for other types of railway vehicles, for example, passenger vehicles, since the dynamic responses are\ndifferent from freight vehicles. In that case, exploring other recent types of autoencoders,\nTo increase the complexity of the problem, the objective is to explore the concept of\nmultiple damages (same or different OOR types). For this, it will be necessary to incorporate a new stage in the methodology, the damage location stage, which will make it possible\nto distinguish isolated damage from multiple damage, as well as their respective location.\nThus, damage will be identified using cut signals, which will then be used to classify theThis work is a result of project WAY4SafeRail-WAYside monitoring system FOR SAFE RAIL transportation, with reference NORTE-01-0247-FEDER-069595, co-funded by the European Regional\nDevelopment Fund (ERDF), through the North Portugal Regional Operational Programme\nPartnership Agreement.

Within this context,\nan unsupervised methodology based on artificial intelligence techniques is presented, which allows the detection and classification of wheels, based on dynamic responses induced on the track by crossing freight railway vehicles. The methodology involves the following\nsteps: (i) data collection and pre-processing, (ii) feature extraction (iii)\ndata fusion and (iv) feature discrimination.

However, this type of system entail high costs envisaging the vehicle wheel condition monitoring, since sensors need to be installed in every vehicle in order to achieve a good representativity . On the other hand, wayside systems are a more viable solution for identifying wheel defects, since the condition of allThe most common wheel defects are known as OOR. As the name infers, this defect is related to deformations on the surface of the wheel circumference that make it not round.\nThis deformation can have many forms and different causes, leading to faults on the vehicle and on the track due to the higher dynamic force values [4–6]. The OOR damagesa function of their shape and size, vehicle characteristics and speed [7–10]. Wheel flats induce high dynamic impact loads on the railway infrastructure, which causes significant damage to both tracks and vehicles, such as broken axles, damaged rolling bearings and cracks in the wheels, rails and sleepers . Moreover, it also generates high vibrations\ntransmitted to the rolling stock, inducing significant stresses and causing damage to the In the case of polygonal wheels, the formation mechanism can be roughly classified\ninto three categories, namely, (1) initial wheel defects , (2) a natural vibration of the\nvehicle–track system and (3) thermoelastic instability . The formation mechanism is strongly contingent on the vehicle type and its operational characteristics, withof dominant harmonic orders [19–22]. For example, Tao et al. studied asymmetrical polygonal wear on metro wheels and obtained harmonic orders of 12–14, while another study by Tao et al. found that the most common harmonic order in Chinese freight trains is 18–19. Although a polygonal wheel could generate less impact on the track than a\nwheel flat, this defect can cause serious damage to the track due to resonance effects in the\nTo identify the occurrence of these OOR anomalies in train wheels, innovative\nmethodologies have been developed combining signal processing and automatic learning techniques. These methodologies are based on the extraction of damage sensitivity features, making possible the distinction between undamaged and damaged situations. Recently, many studies have shown good results in detecting OOR damages using\ndistinct approaches [24–29]. Mishra et al. concluded that a single FBG (Fiber Bragg Grating) sensor, positioned along the rail can detect the presence of wheel flats.\nLourenço et al. created an automatic algorithm for diagnosing OOR defects. The\nproposed methodology consists of isolating specific defective wheels and then identifying the severity of the damage, using only acceleration and strain data measured on\nthe track. In another study, Krummenacher et al. , proposed two machine-learningBy extracting the features, it is possible to transform the measured data into an alternative form of information where the correlation with damage is more easily observed. There are various techniques for feature extraction, the most common being CWT\n(continuous wavelet transform) [31–33], PCA (principal component analysis) ,detection of polygonal wheels on freight vehicles using CWT and ARX features, using\n6 accelerometers, 3 on each side of the railway track. Mosleh et al. introduced aflats by extracting AR features from acceleration records. Moreover, Mohammadi et al.\nadopted linear features, particularly, CWT, PCA, ARX and AR, and their research findingsin the context of wheel flat damage detection. Although these studies have demonstrated robust results in detection, they show some limitations in dealing with the non-linear effects associated with operational effects, such as the train speed. Due to the inability of these linear techniques to attenuate operation effects, the inclusion of different speeds\nFor most of these studies, a feature normalisation stage is used when it is necessary to remove the operational effects. Usually, latent variable methods are used, such as PCA or multiple linear regression (MLR) . Thus, to deal with the non-linear phenomena and reduce the large amounts of data without relying on the aforementioned methods,\nthe first artificial neural networks were created to inherently execute this task . Over the years, new and more advanced networks have been developed, with the Autoencoder\n(AE) being one of the main types. Later, Olshausen et al. proposed the creation of\nsparse coding and Ng et al. introduced a sparse penalisation term in the hidden layer,\nto acquire more compact and effective features from lower-dimensional data. For some datasets with complex relationships between characteristics, employing more than one SAE\nis necessary, which is why stacked sparse autoencoders (SSAE) are commonly used .\nNowadays, these types of AE are widely used in various scientific fields, but specifically\nfor structural engineering only a few studies are found, and most are about damage detection on bridges [45–47].

Using Lagrange multipliers, this tool connects\nwheel displacements with the track nodal displacements, incorporating track irregularities and OOR profiles through a set of constraint equations. These equations are solved\nalongside equilibrium equations, forming a unified system that couples the two subsystems\n. Including the track irregularities directly in the constraint equations are beneficial since it avoids explicitly considering\nthem in the FEM model. Moreover, it also allows to include the wheel and OOR profiles as a periodic rail irregularity, simplifying the analysis. Thus, before starting the analysis, the\nVSI software imports track irregularities and OOR profiles from a MATLAB file, whichto the vertical and lateral irregularities in each rail in each respective position, and adds it to the constraint equations of the system throughout the dynamics analysis. Then, the\nsystem of dynamic equations is solved using the typical Newmark integration method.\nThe impact of track irregularity on wheel defect classification is significant, as a lower track quality tends to result in a higher likelihood of misclassification. A comprehensive\nexploration of this influence was previously undertaken by Mosleh et al. as documented in their research study . Hence, this study does not delve into the impact of track\nquality; rather, it primarily centres on the utilisation of AI-based methodologies for the detection and classification of wheel defects. For this, four different profiles are used, based\non European Standard EN 13848–2 . In this case, power spectral density (PSD) curvesFor OOR defects, several profiles are defined based on real measurements in representative profiles of the various severities. Subsequently, the structural matrices are imported\nMore details on track and train properties, including additional information on traintrack interaction, can be found in previous publications . Figure 1 shows the\nvehicle–track interaction model schematisation and some details about the train and track\nsubsystems, as well as the track irregularities and wheel-rail contact model.According to the conclusions reached in other studies with this type of damage ,\nthe most promising location of the sensors is on the rail. To reduce installation and maintenance costs, it is important to reduce the number of sensors without compromising the\nquality of the results. Therefore, based on a sensitivity analysis performed during the study,\nonly two vertical unidirectional accelerometers were used on each rail, 4 in total (A1 to A4),\nsince they provided a higher cost–benefit ratio. These sensors are mounted on the rail atdefects, different simulation scenarios with perfect wheels (baseline) and OOR wheels\n(damage) were defined for a five-wagon Laagrss freight train. Based on different crossing speeds, loading schemes and rail irregularities profiles, 120 baseline and 180 damage scenarios (90 for polygonal wheels and 90 for wheel flats) were defined, as summarised in For baseline scenarios, six loading schemes with five different speeds (40, 60, 80, 100\nand 120 km/h) and four rail irregularity profiles were considered, giving a total of 120 scenarios. The loading schemes used are: empty, half-loaded, full-loaded and, additionally,For the damage cases, a total of 90 scenarios were generated for polygonal wheels. These\nscenarios including 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (H1, H2 and H3) x 10 different irregularity profiles within each specified harmonic interval. In these 10 irregularity\nprofiles, based on the defect amplitude, two amplitudes are considered, five simulations for\nA1 and five simulations for A2. Similarly, 90 scenarios were created for wheel flats, involving 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (F1, F2 and F3) x 10 different irregularitywheel radius . This wave phenomenon can be characterised by the different wavelengths formed (harmonics θ ), and by the levels of irregularity ( Lw ) associated with each of the harmonics. According to Peng , it is considered a polygonal wheel when the wear amplitude assumes values above 0. mm and wavelengths between 140 mm and the wheelTo define scenarios with polygonal wheels for the Laagrss wagon, a literature survey on\nexperimental measurements in defective wheels was conducted . Three experimental irregularity profiles were collected, illustrated in Figure 3. The first group (H6-8)\ncorresponds to a study carried out by Cai et al. with dominant harmonics from 6 to 8;**Figure 3.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) of polygonal wheels with**Figure 4.** Examples of polygonal damage profiles for each of the dominant harmonic intervals.the second group (H12-14) to a study authored by Tao et al. with dominant harmonics from 12 to 14; and the third profile (H17-18) to a study performed by Wu et al. with\nBased on the wheel irregularity spectra ( Lw ) taken from the respective measurement profiles, shown in Figure 3, and considering the contribution of the first 30 harmonics, several irregularity profiles were generated, according to Figure 4.

This illustrates the significant**Figure 6.** Acceleration time-series in sensor A1 for Laagrss vehicle: (a) influence of speed, (b) influencehigher speeds.

Then,predefined hyperparameters of the algorithm. The set hyperparameters are encoding and\ndecoding transfer functions, hidden layer size, maximum number of epochs, L2 weight regularisation term, sparsity regularisation term and a sparsity proportion term. Afterwards,**Figure 7.** Flowchart with the main phases of the methodology for detection and classification of OORthe features are extracted in the more compressed layer of the SAE, the so-called bottleneck layer. The number of features obtained is equal to the number of hidden layers which\nis usually considerably lower than the data size, allowing a compression of the input data.\nFurthermore, to enhance the sensitivity to damage, two levels of data fusion are applied to the bottleneck features using the Mahalanobis distance. In the first level, all features are\nfused into a damage index (DI) for each sensor and, in the second level, all the sensors\nare merged resulting in only one DI for each simulation. Finally, automatic damage detection is achieved by performing an outlier analysis, in which a statistical confidence limit\n(CB) is used, based on the Inverse Cumulative Gaussian Distribution Function (ICDF).\nFor feature classification, an automatic clustering process based on the k-means technique is implemented. This algorithm allows for the unsupervised and automatic classification of data, based on the calculation of statistical distances between objects. In k-means technique given a vector of data and chosen k clusters, the key is to find k centroids that minimise\nthe distance of each vector to its nearest centroid . Since it is necessary to define the number of clusters in advance, a global Silhouette index (SIL) was adopted to make\nan automatic process. At the end, the clusters will allow the classification of the two typesbetween the number of correct classifications and the total number of cases.damage detection problems, as it allows a signal to be converted from the time domain to the frequency domain, to capture the excitation frequencies induced by the wheel defects.\nIn addition, a data reduction is carried out at this stage, since the initial records contain aa crossing speed of 80 km/h. When comparing the FFT spectra for a train passage with flats, Figure 8a), with polygonal wheels, Figure 8b), there are visible differences in terms\nof amplitude peak values and excited frequency ranges. For flats, the amplitude peak values are higher and they induce frequencies in the range between DC and 1500accordance with some authors reports . In terms of severities, for flats, the more severe group (55–100 mm) is the one with the higher frequency content, as expected,a baseline response. For polygonal wheels, from the analysis of Figure 8b), it can be seen the frequency peaks for the H12–14 and H17–18 profiles around 100 and 150\nrespectively, while for the profile H6-8 a more flat spectrum is obtained without showing any significant peak. This can be explained by the irregularity level profile of thisThese two graphs can show which frequencies have higher content in the original signal.Autoencoders are artificial neural networks trained using an unsupervised approach,\nwhich aim first to learn coded representations of the data, compressing the input into\na latent space representation, and second, through this compressed information, reconstructing the information. The basic architecture of this type of network consists of threewhere **Wij**, **Wjk** are the weights connection matrices between input layer-hidden\nlayer and hidden layer-output layer, **X** = ( **X** 1, **X** 2, . . ., **Xn** ) is the input data vector,\n**H** = ( **H** 1, . . ., **Hm** ) is the low-dimensional vector and **X** [ˆ] = ( **X** [ˆ] 1, **X** [ˆ] 2, . . ., **X** [ˆ] **n** ) is the output**Figure 8.** Frequency domain responses on position 1 for the crossing speed of 80 km/h: (a) wheel flats,data vector. **b** 1, **b** 2 are bias vectors and σ 1, σ 2 are the activation function used in each of thereconstruction of the input X [ˆ], as shown in Equation (3).

After incorporating various inputs into the SSAE training, they are integrated into the so-called\n‘Input 1’. As training progresses, the data is compressed, and the main characteristics of the signals are obtained and retained in ‘Bottleneck 1’. Subsequently, these characteristics are\nused as input for training the second sparse autoencoder, which, after further compression,\nenables the extraction of the final features. Depending on the type of data under analysis,\nthe compression level differs, so multiple tests should be conducted to optimise these layer sizes. This optimisation was achieved by trial and test, changing both the size of the first\nIt should be noted that this network architecture, where the dimensions of the layers gradually decrease along the network until reaching the bottleneck layer , has proven\nto be highly robust for the type of data used. It allows for effective compression of results**Figure 9.** Schematic of the structure of the SSAE neural network used in this study.After extracting the features from the bottleneck layer of the SSAE, the difference between the healthy wheels scenarios and the damage wheels scenarios is still not sufficient. Hence\na data fusion is performed. With this fusion, it is possible to increase the sensitivity of the\nfeatures, and as a result, to obtain a damage index (DI) for each simulation. Thus, the Mahalanobis distance (MD) is used to reduce the volume of extracted data and preserve the most relevant information . Briefly, MD is a metric that measures the distance between two points in a feature space consisting of two or more variables, being independent of the\nscale of the features, thus allowing an increase in the sensitivity of the features to cases with damage. The MD, denoted here as DI, is calculated for each simulation using the followingin which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−], and ¯ x is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The MD is calculated for each sensor and for each simulation, obtaining a matrix of n distances per k number of sensors.Finally, the discrimination of the features consists in distinguishing the features as corresponding to a healthy or damaged case. At this stage of the methodology, an analysis of\nabnormal values is carried out, which will allow the condition of the train wheels to beautomatically monitored and these values to be classified into different classes. This phaseThe outlier analysis consists of grouping, by probabilistic distribution processes, the datato the previously created group. For this, a statistical confidence limit (CB) is used, based on the inverse cumulative Gaussian distribution function (ICDF), considering the mean\nvalue, ¯ μ, and standard deviation, σ, of the baseline feature vector.Whenever a value of a DI indicator is equal to or greater than CB, it is considered an outlier (the null hypothesis is rejected), thus representing a case of damage.For feature classification, a clustering process is used to divide the dataset into distinct clusters that should be as compact and separated as possible . For clustering, the k-meanson the distances of their vectors. Recent studies showed that the k-means algorithm has shown promising results . The main limitation of this technique is that it requires\nknowledge of the number of clusters in advance. For this purpose, the global silhouetteThis section presents the main results obtained through the application of the methodology proposed in section 3 to the calculated track responses. The methodology is applied using damaged wheel passages for the three simulated train speeds (60, 80 and 100 km/h),hyperparameters (presented in section 3). By adjusting these hyperparameters, it is possible to make the algorithm more efficient and improve the generalisation capabilities, as only\nthe most important features are retained. The optimisation of these hyperparameters isof data under analysis. Based on the principles of the SAE already outlined in other works\nIn the context of this study, the non-linear transfer functions (logsig) proved to be more effective than the linear ones, being the ones used in all the studied cases. After analysing Table 3, there is a similarity in the hyperparameters when comparing the two types of OOR damage. It is observed that the data compression level is the same for both cases, around\n93%, as 500 features are extracted in Bottleneck 2 from the initial input data with 7000\nConcerning the type of damage situation, the size of the ‘Bottleneck 1’ and ‘Bottleneck\n2’ was increased to bring them even closer to the initial amount of input data. This can beanalysis, making it challenging for the autoencoder to define relationships between the data, hence requiring a larger number. On the contrary, the maximum number of epochsIt is also important to emphasise that of the various hyperparameters presented, theOnce the hyperparameters have been defined, all the steps of the methodology are applied to the new dataset. For simplicity, in this section, only the last phase of the methodology will be presented, namely an outlier analysis for damage detection and cluster analysis for damage classification. For each sensor, a matrix n × m is created, where n\nis the number of test passages (baseline scenarios + damage scenarios), and m represents the number of extracted features. So, the size of the matrices is 210 × 2000 in case of the\ntype of damage, 75 × 500 for each amplitude in polygonal wheel, and 120 × 500 for wheelDespite the visual distinction between healthy and damaged wheels based on the data processing presented in subsection 3.2, unsupervised learning must use strategies capable of automatically detecting damage. To this end, an outlier analysis is employed, which consists of defining a confidence threshold using a significance level of 1% , represented**Figure 10.** Automatic OOR damage detection based on outlier analysis.by the green line in Figure 10. This approach makes it possible to successfully detect allTo distinguish the two types of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed. Figure 11\nshows a clear distinction between the damage, even when using a dataset with three different train speeds (60,80 and 100 km/h).. In the case of Figure 11a), using all four\naccelerometers, it is possible to efficiently separate the set into two large clusters, despite\n30 misclassifications (16 in the polygonisation and 14 in the flats). Even so, the accuracy\npercentage is around 85%, which is a very good result. To analyse the sensitivity to the number of sensors, only two sensors were used, one on each side ). The results\nimproved, with a decrease in the number of misclassifications from 30 to 21 (13 for polygonisation and 8 for flats). One explanation could be the disparity in sensor sensitivity to the damage, where some sensors are more sensitive than others due to their spatial positioning in relation to the damage. By merging the data from the less sensitive sensors with the\nmore sensitive ones, this could have a negative impact on the results. Thus, the percentage\nThe purpose behind presenting these two plots was to demonstrate that, whether using 4 sensors or 2 sensors, the classification remains remarkably robust, showing lowAfter identifying the type of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed once again to\nclassify the severity of each damage separately. Regarding polygonal wheels, the classification involves both amplitude and harmonic orders, leading to the clusters depicted in the obtained clusters reasonably reflect the two amplitude groups, with all misclassifications associated with the H6-8 harmonic cases (17 misclassifications). Once the amplitude\nis identified, harmonic classification must be carried out separately for each of the amplitudes. In Figure 12b), related to amplitude A1, it is observed that the obtained clusters**Figure 11.** Automatic OOR damage classification based on cluster analysis using: a) 4 sensors; b) 2are nearly perfect, with only 3 misclassifications. In Figure 12c), there are only 3 misclassifications, totalling 8 misclassifications in the classification of the number of dominant\nThe classification of harmonic order is only possible with the separation of amplitudes,\nFigure 13 presents the clusters obtained for the wheel flat cases. The separation between\nthe less severe group and baseline cases and intermediate (cluster 3) and severe cases (cluster 4) is reduced, resulting in a total of 19 misclassifications. Nevertheless, this result showsrate of about 84%. One possible reason for this significant number of misclassifications could be directly associated with the number of impacts captured by the sensor.In order to contribute to the safety of railway transportation and service quality, an automatic methodology based on machine learning has been proposed. This methodology can accurately detect and classify two types of OOR wheel damage in railway vehicles allowing to mitigate problems at both track and vehicle level, such as derailments or material\ndegradation. It includes a new technique for feature extraction based on a dedicated neural network, the Sparse Autoencoder. This non-linear technique is an upgrade concerning the commonly used linear techniques for feature extraction since it allows a better normalisation of the operational effects in the analysed data, as well as the reduction of large amounts\nof data without relying on other techniques, while keeping the most valuable information. These improvements are achieved through the use of different hyperparameters in**Figure 12.** Automatic classification of polygonal wheels based on cluster analysis: a) amplitude A1-A2;**Figure 13.** Automatic classification of wheel flats based on cluster analysis.the calculations, such as non-linear activation functions and sparsity terms. Consequently,circulation. Particularly in the railway engineering field, the inclusion of this technique\nshowed a good potential to deal with variable train speeds, essentially due to the amplifying effect on the measured track dynamic responses which could induce errors in damage The application of the methodology to the data set proved to be very successful in detecting and classifying the two types of OOR damages. Damage detection was perfect, without\nany false detection. In terms of classifying the type of damage, the results are very good,\nwith a success rate of around 85%, but if only two accelerometers are considered the successrate increases to around 90%. These results are encouraging since the range of speeds considered in the analysis, between 60 and 100 km/h, is the most representative of in-service\nfreight trains. Also, the results show that including the Sparse Autoencoder has a positive\neffect in the normalization of the train speed in the damage data set.\nRegarding the severity classification for each type of damage, the methodology proved equally successful in clustering the different damage severities. For polygonal wheels, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the severity groups in terms of defect amplitude, failing only for the H6-8 harmonic cases, and in terms of harmonic orders for each amplitude,\nwith almost perfect results. For wheel flats, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the three severity groups, though with some misclassifications between the less severe group\nand baseline cases and between intermediate and severe cases. A success rate of around 86%\nis achieved in the classification of polygonal wheel severities and 84% in the classification of wheel flat severities. Even so, these high success rates of over 80% show the robustness\nof this methodology in damage classification regardless of the train speed.on on-site measurements. Additionally, this methodology could be carried out for other types of railway vehicles, for example, passenger vehicles, since the dynamic responses are\ndifferent from freight vehicles. In that case, exploring other recent types of autoencoders,\nTo increase the complexity of the problem, the objective is to explore the concept of\nmultiple damages (same or different OOR types). For this, it will be necessary to incorporate a new stage in the methodology, the damage location stage, which will make it possible\nto distinguish isolated damage from multiple damage, as well as their respective location.\nThus, damage will be identified using cut signals, which will then be used to classify theThis work is a result of project WAY4SafeRail-WAYside monitoring system FOR SAFE RAIL transportation, with reference NORTE-01-0247-FEDER-069595, co-funded by the European Regional\nDevelopment Fund (ERDF), through the North Portugal Regional Operational Programme\nPartnership Agreement.

Within this context,\nan unsupervised methodology based on artificial intelligence techniques is presented, which allows the detection and classification of wheels, based on dynamic responses induced on the track by crossing freight railway vehicles. The methodology involves the following\nsteps: (i) data collection and pre-processing, (ii) feature extraction (iii)\ndata fusion and (iv) feature discrimination. In the first phase, an FFT\nalgorithm is applied to the acceleration track responses. Then, features are extracted after training a Stacked Sparse Autoencoder, in which the main features of the responses are obtained after a compression stage using an encoder network. This lower dimensional\nlayer forces the model to learn a compression of the input data. Then,\nwhich enhances the sensitivity to the damage recognition. Posteriorly, an outlier analysis is performed to distinguish a healthy wheelRail vehicle wheels are subjected to constant wear and tear due to continuous use and inadequate maintenance plans. Over time, this wear and tear can generate more significant defects, so it is extremely important to use sensing to understand when maintenance of both the track and rolling stock is required.

However, this type of system entail high costs envisaging the vehicle wheel condition monitoring, since sensors need to be installed in every vehicle in order to achieve a good representativity . On the other hand, wayside systems are a more viable solution for identifying wheel defects, since the condition of allThe most common wheel defects are known as OOR. As the name infers, this defect is related to deformations on the surface of the wheel circumference that make it not round.\nThis deformation can have many forms and different causes, leading to faults on the vehicle and on the track due to the higher dynamic force values [4–6]. The OOR damagesa function of their shape and size, vehicle characteristics and speed [7–10]. Wheel flats induce high dynamic impact loads on the railway infrastructure, which causes significant damage to both tracks and vehicles, such as broken axles, damaged rolling bearings and cracks in the wheels, rails and sleepers . Moreover, it also generates high vibrations\ntransmitted to the rolling stock, inducing significant stresses and causing damage to the In the case of polygonal wheels, the formation mechanism can be roughly classified\ninto three categories, namely, (1) initial wheel defects , (2) a natural vibration of the\nvehicle–track system and (3) thermoelastic instability . The formation mechanism is strongly contingent on the vehicle type and its operational characteristics, withof dominant harmonic orders [19–22]. For example, Tao et al. studied asymmetrical polygonal wear on metro wheels and obtained harmonic orders of 12–14, while another study by Tao et al. found that the most common harmonic order in Chinese freight trains is 18–19. Although a polygonal wheel could generate less impact on the track than a\nwheel flat, this defect can cause serious damage to the track due to resonance effects in the\nTo identify the occurrence of these OOR anomalies in train wheels, innovative\nmethodologies have been developed combining signal processing and automatic learning techniques. These methodologies are based on the extraction of damage sensitivity features, making possible the distinction between undamaged and damaged situations. Recently, many studies have shown good results in detecting OOR damages using\ndistinct approaches [24–29]. Mishra et al. concluded that a single FBG (Fiber Bragg Grating) sensor, positioned along the rail can detect the presence of wheel flats.\nLourenço et al. created an automatic algorithm for diagnosing OOR defects. The\nproposed methodology consists of isolating specific defective wheels and then identifying the severity of the damage, using only acceleration and strain data measured on\nthe track. In another study, Krummenacher et al. , proposed two machine-learningBy extracting the features, it is possible to transform the measured data into an alternative form of information where the correlation with damage is more easily observed. There are various techniques for feature extraction, the most common being CWT\n(continuous wavelet transform) [31–33], PCA (principal component analysis) ,detection of polygonal wheels on freight vehicles using CWT and ARX features, using\n6 accelerometers, 3 on each side of the railway track. Mosleh et al. introduced aflats by extracting AR features from acceleration records. Moreover, Mohammadi et al.\nadopted linear features, particularly, CWT, PCA, ARX and AR, and their research findingsin the context of wheel flat damage detection. Although these studies have demonstrated robust results in detection, they show some limitations in dealing with the non-linear effects associated with operational effects, such as the train speed. Due to the inability of these linear techniques to attenuate operation effects, the inclusion of different speeds\nFor most of these studies, a feature normalisation stage is used when it is necessary to remove the operational effects. Usually, latent variable methods are used, such as PCA or multiple linear regression (MLR) . Thus, to deal with the non-linear phenomena and reduce the large amounts of data without relying on the aforementioned methods,\nthe first artificial neural networks were created to inherently execute this task . Over the years, new and more advanced networks have been developed, with the Autoencoder\n(AE) being one of the main types. Later, Olshausen et al. proposed the creation of\nsparse coding and Ng et al. introduced a sparse penalisation term in the hidden layer,\nto acquire more compact and effective features from lower-dimensional data. For some datasets with complex relationships between characteristics, employing more than one SAE\nis necessary, which is why stacked sparse autoencoders (SSAE) are commonly used .\nNowadays, these types of AE are widely used in various scientific fields, but specifically\nfor structural engineering only a few studies are found, and most are about damage detection on bridges [45–47].

Pathirage et al. proposed a framework utilizing SAE’s potential for dimensionality reduction, which facilitated the assessment of damage detection performance on Many of these AE algorithms already performed feature classification in order to discriminate the different types of damages and severities. However, the AE methods can also be combined with other techniques commonly used to classify the data. They can be used unsupervised methods, in which the model is trained without any labels provided to the\ntraining dataset, such as k-means , self-organising maps (SOM) , isolation forest, gaussian mixture model , k-medoids and cluster analysis , or supervised\nmethods, which assume that the hierarchy of database categories is known, such as NaiveBayes classifiers , k-Nearest Neighbours classifiers , Support Vector Machinetwo types of OOR damages, flats and polygonal wheels, based on acceleration responses obtained from a virtual wayside monitoring system.

The application of sensors on both sides of theTo obtain the responses from the railway track, it is necessary to apply sensors on the track that can measure the dynamic responses of the crossing trains. As it is not always possible\nto install them due to the high costs involved, simulations have been carried out based on calibrated models of the track , vehicle and considering their dynamic interaction,\nas well as including the track irregularities. Simulations include cases with healthy wheelsTo simulate the dynamic interactions between the vehicle and the track, an in-house software VSI – Vehicle-Structure Interaction Analysis is used, which was initially developed by\nNeves et al. and later improved by Montenegro et al. .

Including the track irregularities directly in the constraint equations are beneficial since it avoids explicitly considering\nthem in the FEM model. Moreover, it also allows to include the wheel and OOR profiles as a periodic rail irregularity, simplifying the analysis. Thus, before starting the analysis, the\nVSI software imports track irregularities and OOR profiles from a MATLAB file, whichto the vertical and lateral irregularities in each rail in each respective position, and adds it to the constraint equations of the system throughout the dynamics analysis. Then, the\nsystem of dynamic equations is solved using the typical Newmark integration method.\nThe impact of track irregularity on wheel defect classification is significant, as a lower track quality tends to result in a higher likelihood of misclassification. A comprehensive\nexploration of this influence was previously undertaken by Mosleh et al. as documented in their research study . Hence, this study does not delve into the impact of track\nquality; rather, it primarily centres on the utilisation of AI-based methodologies for the detection and classification of wheel defects. For this, four different profiles are used, based\non European Standard EN 13848–2 .

Subsequently, the structural matrices are imported\nMore details on track and train properties, including additional information on traintrack interaction, can be found in previous publications . Figure 1 shows the\nvehicle–track interaction model schematisation and some details about the train and track\nsubsystems, as well as the track irregularities and wheel-rail contact model.According to the conclusions reached in other studies with this type of damage ,\nthe most promising location of the sensors is on the rail. To reduce installation and maintenance costs, it is important to reduce the number of sensors without compromising the\nquality of the results. Therefore, based on a sensitivity analysis performed during the study,\nonly two vertical unidirectional accelerometers were used on each rail, 4 in total (A1 to A4),\nsince they provided a higher cost–benefit ratio. These sensors are mounted on the rail atdefects, different simulation scenarios with perfect wheels (baseline) and OOR wheels\n(damage) were defined for a five-wagon Laagrss freight train. Based on different crossing speeds, loading schemes and rail irregularities profiles, 120 baseline and 180 damage scenarios (90 for polygonal wheels and 90 for wheel flats) were defined, as summarised in For baseline scenarios, six loading schemes with five different speeds (40, 60, 80, 100\nand 120 km/h) and four rail irregularity profiles were considered, giving a total of 120 scenarios. The loading schemes used are: empty, half-loaded, full-loaded and, additionally,For the damage cases, a total of 90 scenarios were generated for polygonal wheels. These\nscenarios including 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (H1, H2 and H3) x 10 different irregularity profiles within each specified harmonic interval. In these 10 irregularity\nprofiles, based on the defect amplitude, two amplitudes are considered, five simulations for\nA1 and five simulations for A2. Similarly, 90 scenarios were created for wheel flats, involving 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (F1, F2 and F3) x 10 different irregularitywheel radius . This wave phenomenon can be characterised by the different wavelengths formed (harmonics θ ), and by the levels of irregularity ( Lw ) associated with each of the harmonics. According to Peng , it is considered a polygonal wheel when the wear amplitude assumes values above 0. mm and wavelengths between 140 mm and the wheelTo define scenarios with polygonal wheels for the Laagrss wagon, a literature survey on\nexperimental measurements in defective wheels was conducted . Three experimental irregularity profiles were collected, illustrated in Figure 3. The first group (H6-8)\ncorresponds to a study carried out by Cai et al. with dominant harmonics from 6 to 8;**Figure 3.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) of polygonal wheels with**Figure 4.** Examples of polygonal damage profiles for each of the dominant harmonic intervals.the second group (H12-14) to a study authored by Tao et al. with dominant harmonics from 12 to 14; and the third profile (H17-18) to a study performed by Wu et al. with\nBased on the wheel irregularity spectra ( Lw ) taken from the respective measurement profiles, shown in Figure 3, and considering the contribution of the first 30 harmonics, several irregularity profiles were generated, according to Figure 4.

Afterwards,**Figure 7.** Flowchart with the main phases of the methodology for detection and classification of OORthe features are extracted in the more compressed layer of the SAE, the so-called bottleneck layer. The number of features obtained is equal to the number of hidden layers which\nis usually considerably lower than the data size, allowing a compression of the input data.\nFurthermore, to enhance the sensitivity to damage, two levels of data fusion are applied to the bottleneck features using the Mahalanobis distance. In the first level, all features are\nfused into a damage index (DI) for each sensor and, in the second level, all the sensors\nare merged resulting in only one DI for each simulation. Finally, automatic damage detection is achieved by performing an outlier analysis, in which a statistical confidence limit\n(CB) is used, based on the Inverse Cumulative Gaussian Distribution Function (ICDF).\nFor feature classification, an automatic clustering process based on the k-means technique is implemented. This algorithm allows for the unsupervised and automatic classification of data, based on the calculation of statistical distances between objects. In k-means technique given a vector of data and chosen k clusters, the key is to find k centroids that minimise\nthe distance of each vector to its nearest centroid . Since it is necessary to define the number of clusters in advance, a global Silhouette index (SIL) was adopted to make\nan automatic process. At the end, the clusters will allow the classification of the two typesbetween the number of correct classifications and the total number of cases.damage detection problems, as it allows a signal to be converted from the time domain to the frequency domain, to capture the excitation frequencies induced by the wheel defects.\nIn addition, a data reduction is carried out at this stage, since the initial records contain aa crossing speed of 80 km/h. When comparing the FFT spectra for a train passage with flats, Figure 8a), with polygonal wheels, Figure 8b), there are visible differences in terms\nof amplitude peak values and excited frequency ranges. For flats, the amplitude peak values are higher and they induce frequencies in the range between DC and 1500accordance with some authors reports . In terms of severities, for flats, the more severe group (55–100 mm) is the one with the higher frequency content, as expected,a baseline response. For polygonal wheels, from the analysis of Figure 8b), it can be seen the frequency peaks for the H12–14 and H17–18 profiles around 100 and 150\nrespectively, while for the profile H6-8 a more flat spectrum is obtained without showing any significant peak. This can be explained by the irregularity level profile of thisThese two graphs can show which frequencies have higher content in the original signal.Autoencoders are artificial neural networks trained using an unsupervised approach,\nwhich aim first to learn coded representations of the data, compressing the input into\na latent space representation, and second, through this compressed information, reconstructing the information.

After incorporating various inputs into the SSAE training, they are integrated into the so-called\n‘Input 1’. As training progresses, the data is compressed, and the main characteristics of the signals are obtained and retained in ‘Bottleneck 1’. Subsequently, these characteristics are\nused as input for training the second sparse autoencoder, which, after further compression,\nenables the extraction of the final features. Depending on the type of data under analysis,\nthe compression level differs, so multiple tests should be conducted to optimise these layer sizes. This optimisation was achieved by trial and test, changing both the size of the first\nIt should be noted that this network architecture, where the dimensions of the layers gradually decrease along the network until reaching the bottleneck layer , has proven\nto be highly robust for the type of data used. It allows for effective compression of results**Figure 9.** Schematic of the structure of the SSAE neural network used in this study.After extracting the features from the bottleneck layer of the SSAE, the difference between the healthy wheels scenarios and the damage wheels scenarios is still not sufficient. Hence\na data fusion is performed. With this fusion, it is possible to increase the sensitivity of the\nfeatures, and as a result, to obtain a damage index (DI) for each simulation. Thus, the Mahalanobis distance (MD) is used to reduce the volume of extracted data and preserve the most relevant information . Briefly, MD is a metric that measures the distance between two points in a feature space consisting of two or more variables, being independent of the\nscale of the features, thus allowing an increase in the sensitivity of the features to cases with damage. The MD, denoted here as DI, is calculated for each simulation using the followingin which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−], and ¯ x is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The MD is calculated for each sensor and for each simulation, obtaining a matrix of n distances per k number of sensors.Finally, the discrimination of the features consists in distinguishing the features as corresponding to a healthy or damaged case. At this stage of the methodology, an analysis of\nabnormal values is carried out, which will allow the condition of the train wheels to beautomatically monitored and these values to be classified into different classes. This phaseThe outlier analysis consists of grouping, by probabilistic distribution processes, the datato the previously created group. For this, a statistical confidence limit (CB) is used, based on the inverse cumulative Gaussian distribution function (ICDF), considering the mean\nvalue, ¯ μ, and standard deviation, σ, of the baseline feature vector.Whenever a value of a DI indicator is equal to or greater than CB, it is considered an outlier (the null hypothesis is rejected), thus representing a case of damage.For feature classification, a clustering process is used to divide the dataset into distinct clusters that should be as compact and separated as possible . For clustering, the k-meanson the distances of their vectors. Recent studies showed that the k-means algorithm has shown promising results . The main limitation of this technique is that it requires\nknowledge of the number of clusters in advance. For this purpose, the global silhouetteThis section presents the main results obtained through the application of the methodology proposed in section 3 to the calculated track responses. The methodology is applied using damaged wheel passages for the three simulated train speeds (60, 80 and 100 km/h),hyperparameters (presented in section 3). By adjusting these hyperparameters, it is possible to make the algorithm more efficient and improve the generalisation capabilities, as only\nthe most important features are retained. The optimisation of these hyperparameters isof data under analysis. Based on the principles of the SAE already outlined in other works\nIn the context of this study, the non-linear transfer functions (logsig) proved to be more effective than the linear ones, being the ones used in all the studied cases. After analysing Table 3, there is a similarity in the hyperparameters when comparing the two types of OOR damage. It is observed that the data compression level is the same for both cases, around\n93%, as 500 features are extracted in Bottleneck 2 from the initial input data with 7000\nConcerning the type of damage situation, the size of the ‘Bottleneck 1’ and ‘Bottleneck\n2’ was increased to bring them even closer to the initial amount of input data. This can beanalysis, making it challenging for the autoencoder to define relationships between the data, hence requiring a larger number. On the contrary, the maximum number of epochsIt is also important to emphasise that of the various hyperparameters presented, theOnce the hyperparameters have been defined, all the steps of the methodology are applied to the new dataset. For simplicity, in this section, only the last phase of the methodology will be presented, namely an outlier analysis for damage detection and cluster analysis for damage classification. For each sensor, a matrix n × m is created, where n\nis the number of test passages (baseline scenarios + damage scenarios), and m represents the number of extracted features. So, the size of the matrices is 210 × 2000 in case of the\ntype of damage, 75 × 500 for each amplitude in polygonal wheel, and 120 × 500 for wheelDespite the visual distinction between healthy and damaged wheels based on the data processing presented in subsection 3.2, unsupervised learning must use strategies capable of automatically detecting damage. To this end, an outlier analysis is employed, which consists of defining a confidence threshold using a significance level of 1% , represented**Figure 10.** Automatic OOR damage detection based on outlier analysis.by the green line in Figure 10. This approach makes it possible to successfully detect allTo distinguish the two types of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed. Figure 11\nshows a clear distinction between the damage, even when using a dataset with three different train speeds (60,80 and 100 km/h).. In the case of Figure 11a), using all four\naccelerometers, it is possible to efficiently separate the set into two large clusters, despite\n30 misclassifications (16 in the polygonisation and 14 in the flats). Even so, the accuracy\npercentage is around 85%, which is a very good result. To analyse the sensitivity to the number of sensors, only two sensors were used, one on each side ). The results\nimproved, with a decrease in the number of misclassifications from 30 to 21 (13 for polygonisation and 8 for flats). One explanation could be the disparity in sensor sensitivity to the damage, where some sensors are more sensitive than others due to their spatial positioning in relation to the damage. By merging the data from the less sensitive sensors with the\nmore sensitive ones, this could have a negative impact on the results. Thus, the percentage\nThe purpose behind presenting these two plots was to demonstrate that, whether using 4 sensors or 2 sensors, the classification remains remarkably robust, showing lowAfter identifying the type of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed once again to\nclassify the severity of each damage separately. Regarding polygonal wheels, the classification involves both amplitude and harmonic orders, leading to the clusters depicted in the obtained clusters reasonably reflect the two amplitude groups, with all misclassifications associated with the H6-8 harmonic cases (17 misclassifications). Once the amplitude\nis identified, harmonic classification must be carried out separately for each of the amplitudes. In Figure 12b), related to amplitude A1, it is observed that the obtained clusters**Figure 11.** Automatic OOR damage classification based on cluster analysis using: a) 4 sensors; b) 2are nearly perfect, with only 3 misclassifications. In Figure 12c), there are only 3 misclassifications, totalling 8 misclassifications in the classification of the number of dominant\nThe classification of harmonic order is only possible with the separation of amplitudes,\nFigure 13 presents the clusters obtained for the wheel flat cases. The separation between\nthe less severe group and baseline cases and intermediate (cluster 3) and severe cases (cluster 4) is reduced, resulting in a total of 19 misclassifications. Nevertheless, this result showsrate of about 84%. One possible reason for this significant number of misclassifications could be directly associated with the number of impacts captured by the sensor.In order to contribute to the safety of railway transportation and service quality, an automatic methodology based on machine learning has been proposed. This methodology can accurately detect and classify two types of OOR wheel damage in railway vehicles allowing to mitigate problems at both track and vehicle level, such as derailments or material\ndegradation. It includes a new technique for feature extraction based on a dedicated neural network, the Sparse Autoencoder. This non-linear technique is an upgrade concerning the commonly used linear techniques for feature extraction since it allows a better normalisation of the operational effects in the analysed data, as well as the reduction of large amounts\nof data without relying on other techniques, while keeping the most valuable information. These improvements are achieved through the use of different hyperparameters in**Figure 12.** Automatic classification of polygonal wheels based on cluster analysis: a) amplitude A1-A2;**Figure 13.** Automatic classification of wheel flats based on cluster analysis.the calculations, such as non-linear activation functions and sparsity terms. Consequently,circulation. Particularly in the railway engineering field, the inclusion of this technique\nshowed a good potential to deal with variable train speeds, essentially due to the amplifying effect on the measured track dynamic responses which could induce errors in damage The application of the methodology to the data set proved to be very successful in detecting and classifying the two types of OOR damages. Damage detection was perfect, without\nany false detection. In terms of classifying the type of damage, the results are very good,\nwith a success rate of around 85%, but if only two accelerometers are considered the successrate increases to around 90%. These results are encouraging since the range of speeds considered in the analysis, between 60 and 100 km/h, is the most representative of in-service\nfreight trains. Also, the results show that including the Sparse Autoencoder has a positive\neffect in the normalization of the train speed in the damage data set.\nRegarding the severity classification for each type of damage, the methodology proved equally successful in clustering the different damage severities. For polygonal wheels, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the severity groups in terms of defect amplitude, failing only for the H6-8 harmonic cases, and in terms of harmonic orders for each amplitude,\nwith almost perfect results. For wheel flats, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the three severity groups, though with some misclassifications between the less severe group\nand baseline cases and between intermediate and severe cases.

Within this context,\nan unsupervised methodology based on artificial intelligence techniques is presented, which allows the detection and classification of wheels, based on dynamic responses induced on the track by crossing freight railway vehicles. The methodology involves the following\nsteps: (i) data collection and pre-processing, (ii) feature extraction (iii)\ndata fusion and (iv) feature discrimination. In the first phase, an FFT\nalgorithm is applied to the acceleration track responses. Then, features are extracted after training a Stacked Sparse Autoencoder, in which the main features of the responses are obtained after a compression stage using an encoder network. This lower dimensional\nlayer forces the model to learn a compression of the input data. Then,\nwhich enhances the sensitivity to the damage recognition. Posteriorly, an outlier analysis is performed to distinguish a healthy wheelRail vehicle wheels are subjected to constant wear and tear due to continuous use and inadequate maintenance plans. Over time, this wear and tear can generate more significant defects, so it is extremely important to use sensing to understand when maintenance of both the track and rolling stock is required.

However, this type of system entail high costs envisaging the vehicle wheel condition monitoring, since sensors need to be installed in every vehicle in order to achieve a good representativity . On the other hand, wayside systems are a more viable solution for identifying wheel defects, since the condition of allThe most common wheel defects are known as OOR. As the name infers, this defect is related to deformations on the surface of the wheel circumference that make it not round.\nThis deformation can have many forms and different causes, leading to faults on the vehicle and on the track due to the higher dynamic force values [4–6]. The OOR damagesa function of their shape and size, vehicle characteristics and speed [7–10]. Wheel flats induce high dynamic impact loads on the railway infrastructure, which causes significant damage to both tracks and vehicles, such as broken axles, damaged rolling bearings and cracks in the wheels, rails and sleepers . Moreover, it also generates high vibrations\ntransmitted to the rolling stock, inducing significant stresses and causing damage to the In the case of polygonal wheels, the formation mechanism can be roughly classified\ninto three categories, namely, (1) initial wheel defects , (2) a natural vibration of the\nvehicle–track system and (3) thermoelastic instability . The formation mechanism is strongly contingent on the vehicle type and its operational characteristics, withof dominant harmonic orders [19–22]. For example, Tao et al. studied asymmetrical polygonal wear on metro wheels and obtained harmonic orders of 12–14, while another study by Tao et al. found that the most common harmonic order in Chinese freight trains is 18–19. Although a polygonal wheel could generate less impact on the track than a\nwheel flat, this defect can cause serious damage to the track due to resonance effects in the\nTo identify the occurrence of these OOR anomalies in train wheels, innovative\nmethodologies have been developed combining signal processing and automatic learning techniques. These methodologies are based on the extraction of damage sensitivity features, making possible the distinction between undamaged and damaged situations. Recently, many studies have shown good results in detecting OOR damages using\ndistinct approaches [24–29]. Mishra et al. concluded that a single FBG (Fiber Bragg Grating) sensor, positioned along the rail can detect the presence of wheel flats.\nLourenço et al. created an automatic algorithm for diagnosing OOR defects. The\nproposed methodology consists of isolating specific defective wheels and then identifying the severity of the damage, using only acceleration and strain data measured on\nthe track. In another study, Krummenacher et al. , proposed two machine-learningBy extracting the features, it is possible to transform the measured data into an alternative form of information where the correlation with damage is more easily observed. There are various techniques for feature extraction, the most common being CWT\n(continuous wavelet transform) [31–33], PCA (principal component analysis) ,detection of polygonal wheels on freight vehicles using CWT and ARX features, using\n6 accelerometers, 3 on each side of the railway track. Mosleh et al. introduced aflats by extracting AR features from acceleration records. Moreover, Mohammadi et al.\nadopted linear features, particularly, CWT, PCA, ARX and AR, and their research findingsin the context of wheel flat damage detection. Although these studies have demonstrated robust results in detection, they show some limitations in dealing with the non-linear effects associated with operational effects, such as the train speed. Due to the inability of these linear techniques to attenuate operation effects, the inclusion of different speeds\nFor most of these studies, a feature normalisation stage is used when it is necessary to remove the operational effects. Usually, latent variable methods are used, such as PCA or multiple linear regression (MLR) . Thus, to deal with the non-linear phenomena and reduce the large amounts of data without relying on the aforementioned methods,\nthe first artificial neural networks were created to inherently execute this task . Over the years, new and more advanced networks have been developed, with the Autoencoder\n(AE) being one of the main types. Later, Olshausen et al. proposed the creation of\nsparse coding and Ng et al. introduced a sparse penalisation term in the hidden layer,\nto acquire more compact and effective features from lower-dimensional data. For some datasets with complex relationships between characteristics, employing more than one SAE\nis necessary, which is why stacked sparse autoencoders (SSAE) are commonly used .\nNowadays, these types of AE are widely used in various scientific fields, but specifically\nfor structural engineering only a few studies are found, and most are about damage detection on bridges [45–47]. Amaral et al. , proposed an approach for detecting structural anomalies based on SAE and Shewhart’s T control chart. The characteristics extracted byin structures. In another similar study, Amaral et al. , applied the same approach to\na numerical model of a highway viaduct in Brazil reaching more than 99% of successful classifications of structural damage with the combination of SAE and Support Vector Machine. Pathirage et al. proposed a framework utilizing SAE’s potential for dimensionality reduction, which facilitated the assessment of damage detection performance on Many of these AE algorithms already performed feature classification in order to discriminate the different types of damages and severities. However, the AE methods can also be combined with other techniques commonly used to classify the data. They can be used unsupervised methods, in which the model is trained without any labels provided to the\ntraining dataset, such as k-means , self-organising maps (SOM) , isolation forest, gaussian mixture model , k-medoids and cluster analysis , or supervised\nmethods, which assume that the hierarchy of database categories is known, such as NaiveBayes classifiers , k-Nearest Neighbours classifiers , Support Vector Machinetwo types of OOR damages, flats and polygonal wheels, based on acceleration responses obtained from a virtual wayside monitoring system.

The application of sensors on both sides of theTo obtain the responses from the railway track, it is necessary to apply sensors on the track that can measure the dynamic responses of the crossing trains. As it is not always possible\nto install them due to the high costs involved, simulations have been carried out based on calibrated models of the track , vehicle and considering their dynamic interaction,\nas well as including the track irregularities. Simulations include cases with healthy wheelsTo simulate the dynamic interactions between the vehicle and the track, an in-house software VSI – Vehicle-Structure Interaction Analysis is used, which was initially developed by\nNeves et al. and later improved by Montenegro et al. .

Using Lagrange multipliers, this tool connects\nwheel displacements with the track nodal displacements, incorporating track irregularities and OOR profiles through a set of constraint equations. These equations are solved\nalongside equilibrium equations, forming a unified system that couples the two subsystems\n. Including the track irregularities directly in the constraint equations are beneficial since it avoids explicitly considering\nthem in the FEM model. Moreover, it also allows to include the wheel and OOR profiles as a periodic rail irregularity, simplifying the analysis. Thus, before starting the analysis, the\nVSI software imports track irregularities and OOR profiles from a MATLAB file, whichto the vertical and lateral irregularities in each rail in each respective position, and adds it to the constraint equations of the system throughout the dynamics analysis. Then, the\nsystem of dynamic equations is solved using the typical Newmark integration method.\nThe impact of track irregularity on wheel defect classification is significant, as a lower track quality tends to result in a higher likelihood of misclassification. A comprehensive\nexploration of this influence was previously undertaken by Mosleh et al. as documented in their research study . Hence, this study does not delve into the impact of track\nquality; rather, it primarily centres on the utilisation of AI-based methodologies for the detection and classification of wheel defects. For this, four different profiles are used, based\non European Standard EN 13848–2 . In this case, power spectral density (PSD) curvesFor OOR defects, several profiles are defined based on real measurements in representative profiles of the various severities. Subsequently, the structural matrices are imported\nMore details on track and train properties, including additional information on traintrack interaction, can be found in previous publications . Figure 1 shows the\nvehicle–track interaction model schematisation and some details about the train and track\nsubsystems, as well as the track irregularities and wheel-rail contact model.According to the conclusions reached in other studies with this type of damage ,\nthe most promising location of the sensors is on the rail. To reduce installation and maintenance costs, it is important to reduce the number of sensors without compromising the\nquality of the results. Therefore, based on a sensitivity analysis performed during the study,\nonly two vertical unidirectional accelerometers were used on each rail, 4 in total (A1 to A4),\nsince they provided a higher cost–benefit ratio. These sensors are mounted on the rail atdefects, different simulation scenarios with perfect wheels (baseline) and OOR wheels\n(damage) were defined for a five-wagon Laagrss freight train. Based on different crossing speeds, loading schemes and rail irregularities profiles, 120 baseline and 180 damage scenarios (90 for polygonal wheels and 90 for wheel flats) were defined, as summarised in For baseline scenarios, six loading schemes with five different speeds (40, 60, 80, 100\nand 120 km/h) and four rail irregularity profiles were considered, giving a total of 120 scenarios. The loading schemes used are: empty, half-loaded, full-loaded and, additionally,For the damage cases, a total of 90 scenarios were generated for polygonal wheels. These\nscenarios including 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (H1, H2 and H3) x 10 different irregularity profiles within each specified harmonic interval. In these 10 irregularity\nprofiles, based on the defect amplitude, two amplitudes are considered, five simulations for\nA1 and five simulations for A2. Similarly, 90 scenarios were created for wheel flats, involving 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (F1, F2 and F3) x 10 different irregularitywheel radius . This wave phenomenon can be characterised by the different wavelengths formed (harmonics θ ), and by the levels of irregularity ( Lw ) associated with each of the harmonics. According to Peng , it is considered a polygonal wheel when the wear amplitude assumes values above 0. mm and wavelengths between 140 mm and the wheelTo define scenarios with polygonal wheels for the Laagrss wagon, a literature survey on\nexperimental measurements in defective wheels was conducted . Three experimental irregularity profiles were collected, illustrated in Figure 3. The first group (H6-8)\ncorresponds to a study carried out by Cai et al. with dominant harmonics from 6 to 8;**Figure 3.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) of polygonal wheels with**Figure 4.** Examples of polygonal damage profiles for each of the dominant harmonic intervals.the second group (H12-14) to a study authored by Tao et al. with dominant harmonics from 12 to 14; and the third profile (H17-18) to a study performed by Wu et al. with\nBased on the wheel irregularity spectra ( Lw ) taken from the respective measurement profiles, shown in Figure 3, and considering the contribution of the first 30 harmonics, several irregularity profiles were generated, according to Figure 4.

The amplifying effect\nof speed can influence the identification of damage, which is why a robust baseline with a wide range of scenarios is very important. At a speed of 40 km/h, lower accelerations\naround 0. m/s⊃2 are observed. In contrast, at a speed of 100 km/h (considerably higher),\naccelerations increase substantially to around 3. m/s⊃2.

Then,predefined hyperparameters of the algorithm. The set hyperparameters are encoding and\ndecoding transfer functions, hidden layer size, maximum number of epochs, L2 weight regularisation term, sparsity regularisation term and a sparsity proportion term. Afterwards,**Figure 7.** Flowchart with the main phases of the methodology for detection and classification of OORthe features are extracted in the more compressed layer of the SAE, the so-called bottleneck layer. The number of features obtained is equal to the number of hidden layers which\nis usually considerably lower than the data size, allowing a compression of the input data.\nFurthermore, to enhance the sensitivity to damage, two levels of data fusion are applied to the bottleneck features using the Mahalanobis distance.

Finally, automatic damage detection is achieved by performing an outlier analysis, in which a statistical confidence limit\n(CB) is used, based on the Inverse Cumulative Gaussian Distribution Function (ICDF).\nFor feature classification, an automatic clustering process based on the k-means technique is implemented. This algorithm allows for the unsupervised and automatic classification of data, based on the calculation of statistical distances between objects. In k-means technique given a vector of data and chosen k clusters, the key is to find k centroids that minimise\nthe distance of each vector to its nearest centroid . Since it is necessary to define the number of clusters in advance, a global Silhouette index (SIL) was adopted to make\nan automatic process. At the end, the clusters will allow the classification of the two typesbetween the number of correct classifications and the total number of cases.damage detection problems, as it allows a signal to be converted from the time domain to the frequency domain, to capture the excitation frequencies induced by the wheel defects.\nIn addition, a data reduction is carried out at this stage, since the initial records contain aa crossing speed of 80 km/h. When comparing the FFT spectra for a train passage with flats, Figure 8a), with polygonal wheels, Figure 8b), there are visible differences in terms\nof amplitude peak values and excited frequency ranges. For flats, the amplitude peak values are higher and they induce frequencies in the range between DC and 1500accordance with some authors reports . In terms of severities, for flats, the more severe group (55–100 mm) is the one with the higher frequency content, as expected,a baseline response. For polygonal wheels, from the analysis of Figure 8b), it can be seen the frequency peaks for the H12–14 and H17–18 profiles around 100 and 150\nrespectively, while for the profile H6-8 a more flat spectrum is obtained without showing any significant peak. This can be explained by the irregularity level profile of thisThese two graphs can show which frequencies have higher content in the original signal.Autoencoders are artificial neural networks trained using an unsupervised approach,\nwhich aim first to learn coded representations of the data, compressing the input into\na latent space representation, and second, through this compressed information, reconstructing the information.

Subsequently, these characteristics are\nused as input for training the second sparse autoencoder, which, after further compression,\nenables the extraction of the final features. Depending on the type of data under analysis,\nthe compression level differs, so multiple tests should be conducted to optimise these layer sizes. This optimisation was achieved by trial and test, changing both the size of the first\nIt should be noted that this network architecture, where the dimensions of the layers gradually decrease along the network until reaching the bottleneck layer , has proven\nto be highly robust for the type of data used. It allows for effective compression of results**Figure 9.** Schematic of the structure of the SSAE neural network used in this study.After extracting the features from the bottleneck layer of the SSAE, the difference between the healthy wheels scenarios and the damage wheels scenarios is still not sufficient. Hence\na data fusion is performed. With this fusion, it is possible to increase the sensitivity of the\nfeatures, and as a result, to obtain a damage index (DI) for each simulation. Thus, the Mahalanobis distance (MD) is used to reduce the volume of extracted data and preserve the most relevant information . Briefly, MD is a metric that measures the distance between two points in a feature space consisting of two or more variables, being independent of the\nscale of the features, thus allowing an increase in the sensitivity of the features to cases with damage. The MD, denoted here as DI, is calculated for each simulation using the followingin which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−], and ¯ x is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The MD is calculated for each sensor and for each simulation, obtaining a matrix of n distances per k number of sensors.Finally, the discrimination of the features consists in distinguishing the features as corresponding to a healthy or damaged case. At this stage of the methodology, an analysis of\nabnormal values is carried out, which will allow the condition of the train wheels to beautomatically monitored and these values to be classified into different classes. This phaseThe outlier analysis consists of grouping, by probabilistic distribution processes, the datato the previously created group. For this, a statistical confidence limit (CB) is used, based on the inverse cumulative Gaussian distribution function (ICDF), considering the mean\nvalue, ¯ μ, and standard deviation, σ, of the baseline feature vector.Whenever a value of a DI indicator is equal to or greater than CB, it is considered an outlier (the null hypothesis is rejected), thus representing a case of damage.For feature classification, a clustering process is used to divide the dataset into distinct clusters that should be as compact and separated as possible . For clustering, the k-meanson the distances of their vectors. Recent studies showed that the k-means algorithm has shown promising results . The main limitation of this technique is that it requires\nknowledge of the number of clusters in advance. For this purpose, the global silhouetteThis section presents the main results obtained through the application of the methodology proposed in section 3 to the calculated track responses. The methodology is applied using damaged wheel passages for the three simulated train speeds (60, 80 and 100 km/h),hyperparameters (presented in section 3). By adjusting these hyperparameters, it is possible to make the algorithm more efficient and improve the generalisation capabilities, as only\nthe most important features are retained. The optimisation of these hyperparameters isof data under analysis. Based on the principles of the SAE already outlined in other works\nIn the context of this study, the non-linear transfer functions (logsig) proved to be more effective than the linear ones, being the ones used in all the studied cases. After analysing Table 3, there is a similarity in the hyperparameters when comparing the two types of OOR damage. It is observed that the data compression level is the same for both cases, around\n93%, as 500 features are extracted in Bottleneck 2 from the initial input data with 7000\nConcerning the type of damage situation, the size of the ‘Bottleneck 1’ and ‘Bottleneck\n2’ was increased to bring them even closer to the initial amount of input data. This can beanalysis, making it challenging for the autoencoder to define relationships between the data, hence requiring a larger number. On the contrary, the maximum number of epochsIt is also important to emphasise that of the various hyperparameters presented, theOnce the hyperparameters have been defined, all the steps of the methodology are applied to the new dataset. For simplicity, in this section, only the last phase of the methodology will be presented, namely an outlier analysis for damage detection and cluster analysis for damage classification. For each sensor, a matrix n × m is created, where n\nis the number of test passages (baseline scenarios + damage scenarios), and m represents the number of extracted features. So, the size of the matrices is 210 × 2000 in case of the\ntype of damage, 75 × 500 for each amplitude in polygonal wheel, and 120 × 500 for wheelDespite the visual distinction between healthy and damaged wheels based on the data processing presented in subsection 3.2, unsupervised learning must use strategies capable of automatically detecting damage. To this end, an outlier analysis is employed, which consists of defining a confidence threshold using a significance level of 1% , represented**Figure 10.** Automatic OOR damage detection based on outlier analysis.by the green line in Figure 10. This approach makes it possible to successfully detect allTo distinguish the two types of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed. Figure 11\nshows a clear distinction between the damage, even when using a dataset with three different train speeds (60,80 and 100 km/h).. In the case of Figure 11a), using all four\naccelerometers, it is possible to efficiently separate the set into two large clusters, despite\n30 misclassifications (16 in the polygonisation and 14 in the flats). Even so, the accuracy\npercentage is around 85%, which is a very good result. To analyse the sensitivity to the number of sensors, only two sensors were used, one on each side ). The results\nimproved, with a decrease in the number of misclassifications from 30 to 21 (13 for polygonisation and 8 for flats). One explanation could be the disparity in sensor sensitivity to the damage, where some sensors are more sensitive than others due to their spatial positioning in relation to the damage. By merging the data from the less sensitive sensors with the\nmore sensitive ones, this could have a negative impact on the results. Thus, the percentage\nThe purpose behind presenting these two plots was to demonstrate that, whether using 4 sensors or 2 sensors, the classification remains remarkably robust, showing lowAfter identifying the type of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed once again to\nclassify the severity of each damage separately. Regarding polygonal wheels, the classification involves both amplitude and harmonic orders, leading to the clusters depicted in the obtained clusters reasonably reflect the two amplitude groups, with all misclassifications associated with the H6-8 harmonic cases (17 misclassifications). Once the amplitude\nis identified, harmonic classification must be carried out separately for each of the amplitudes. In Figure 12b), related to amplitude A1, it is observed that the obtained clusters**Figure 11.** Automatic OOR damage classification based on cluster analysis using: a) 4 sensors; b) 2are nearly perfect, with only 3 misclassifications. In Figure 12c), there are only 3 misclassifications, totalling 8 misclassifications in the classification of the number of dominant\nThe classification of harmonic order is only possible with the separation of amplitudes,\nFigure 13 presents the clusters obtained for the wheel flat cases. The separation between\nthe less severe group and baseline cases and intermediate (cluster 3) and severe cases (cluster 4) is reduced, resulting in a total of 19 misclassifications. Nevertheless, this result showsrate of about 84%. One possible reason for this significant number of misclassifications could be directly associated with the number of impacts captured by the sensor.In order to contribute to the safety of railway transportation and service quality, an automatic methodology based on machine learning has been proposed. This methodology can accurately detect and classify two types of OOR wheel damage in railway vehicles allowing to mitigate problems at both track and vehicle level, such as derailments or material\ndegradation. It includes a new technique for feature extraction based on a dedicated neural network, the Sparse Autoencoder. This non-linear technique is an upgrade concerning the commonly used linear techniques for feature extraction since it allows a better normalisation of the operational effects in the analysed data, as well as the reduction of large amounts\nof data without relying on other techniques, while keeping the most valuable information. These improvements are achieved through the use of different hyperparameters in**Figure 12.** Automatic classification of polygonal wheels based on cluster analysis: a) amplitude A1-A2;**Figure 13.** Automatic classification of wheel flats based on cluster analysis.the calculations, such as non-linear activation functions and sparsity terms. Consequently,circulation. Particularly in the railway engineering field, the inclusion of this technique\nshowed a good potential to deal with variable train speeds, essentially due to the amplifying effect on the measured track dynamic responses which could induce errors in damage The application of the methodology to the data set proved to be very successful in detecting and classifying the two types of OOR damages. Damage detection was perfect, without\nany false detection. In terms of classifying the type of damage, the results are very good,\nwith a success rate of around 85%, but if only two accelerometers are considered the successrate increases to around 90%. These results are encouraging since the range of speeds considered in the analysis, between 60 and 100 km/h, is the most representative of in-service\nfreight trains. Also, the results show that including the Sparse Autoencoder has a positive\neffect in the normalization of the train speed in the damage data set.\nRegarding the severity classification for each type of damage, the methodology proved equally successful in clustering the different damage severities. For polygonal wheels, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the severity groups in terms of defect amplitude, failing only for the H6-8 harmonic cases, and in terms of harmonic orders for each amplitude,\nwith almost perfect results. For wheel flats, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the three severity groups, though with some misclassifications between the less severe group\nand baseline cases and between intermediate and severe cases. A success rate of around 86%\nis achieved in the classification of polygonal wheel severities and 84% in the classification of wheel flat severities. Even so, these high success rates of over 80% show the robustness\nof this methodology in damage classification regardless of the train speed.on on-site measurements. Additionally, this methodology could be carried out for other types of railway vehicles, for example, passenger vehicles, since the dynamic responses are\ndifferent from freight vehicles. In that case, exploring other recent types of autoencoders,\nTo increase the complexity of the problem, the objective is to explore the concept of\nmultiple damages (same or different OOR types). For this, it will be necessary to incorporate a new stage in the methodology, the damage location stage, which will make it possible\nto distinguish isolated damage from multiple damage, as well as their respective location.\nThus, damage will be identified using cut signals, which will then be used to classify theThis work is a result of project WAY4SafeRail-WAYside monitoring system FOR SAFE RAIL transportation, with reference NORTE-01-0247-FEDER-069595, co-funded by the European Regional\nDevelopment Fund (ERDF), through the North Portugal Regional Operational Programme\nPartnership Agreement.

Within this context,\nan unsupervised methodology based on artificial intelligence techniques is presented, which allows the detection and classification of wheels, based on dynamic responses induced on the track by crossing freight railway vehicles. The methodology involves the following\nsteps: (i) data collection and pre-processing, (ii) feature extraction (iii)\ndata fusion and (iv) feature discrimination. In the first phase, an FFT\nalgorithm is applied to the acceleration track responses.

However, this type of system entail high costs envisaging the vehicle wheel condition monitoring, since sensors need to be installed in every vehicle in order to achieve a good representativity . On the other hand, wayside systems are a more viable solution for identifying wheel defects, since the condition of allThe most common wheel defects are known as OOR. As the name infers, this defect is related to deformations on the surface of the wheel circumference that make it not round.\nThis deformation can have many forms and different causes, leading to faults on the vehicle and on the track due to the higher dynamic force values [4–6]. The OOR damagesa function of their shape and size, vehicle characteristics and speed [7–10]. Wheel flats induce high dynamic impact loads on the railway infrastructure, which causes significant damage to both tracks and vehicles, such as broken axles, damaged rolling bearings and cracks in the wheels, rails and sleepers . Moreover, it also generates high vibrations\ntransmitted to the rolling stock, inducing significant stresses and causing damage to the In the case of polygonal wheels, the formation mechanism can be roughly classified\ninto three categories, namely, (1) initial wheel defects , (2) a natural vibration of the\nvehicle–track system and (3) thermoelastic instability . The formation mechanism is strongly contingent on the vehicle type and its operational characteristics, withof dominant harmonic orders [19–22]. For example, Tao et al. studied asymmetrical polygonal wear on metro wheels and obtained harmonic orders of 12–14, while another study by Tao et al. found that the most common harmonic order in Chinese freight trains is 18–19. Although a polygonal wheel could generate less impact on the track than a\nwheel flat, this defect can cause serious damage to the track due to resonance effects in the\nTo identify the occurrence of these OOR anomalies in train wheels, innovative\nmethodologies have been developed combining signal processing and automatic learning techniques. These methodologies are based on the extraction of damage sensitivity features, making possible the distinction between undamaged and damaged situations. Recently, many studies have shown good results in detecting OOR damages using\ndistinct approaches [24–29]. Mishra et al. concluded that a single FBG (Fiber Bragg Grating) sensor, positioned along the rail can detect the presence of wheel flats.\nLourenço et al. created an automatic algorithm for diagnosing OOR defects. The\nproposed methodology consists of isolating specific defective wheels and then identifying the severity of the damage, using only acceleration and strain data measured on\nthe track. In another study, Krummenacher et al. , proposed two machine-learningBy extracting the features, it is possible to transform the measured data into an alternative form of information where the correlation with damage is more easily observed. There are various techniques for feature extraction, the most common being CWT\n(continuous wavelet transform) [31–33], PCA (principal component analysis) ,detection of polygonal wheels on freight vehicles using CWT and ARX features, using\n6 accelerometers, 3 on each side of the railway track. Mosleh et al. introduced aflats by extracting AR features from acceleration records. Moreover, Mohammadi et al.\nadopted linear features, particularly, CWT, PCA, ARX and AR, and their research findingsin the context of wheel flat damage detection. Although these studies have demonstrated robust results in detection, they show some limitations in dealing with the non-linear effects associated with operational effects, such as the train speed. Due to the inability of these linear techniques to attenuate operation effects, the inclusion of different speeds\nFor most of these studies, a feature normalisation stage is used when it is necessary to remove the operational effects. Usually, latent variable methods are used, such as PCA or multiple linear regression (MLR) . Thus, to deal with the non-linear phenomena and reduce the large amounts of data without relying on the aforementioned methods,\nthe first artificial neural networks were created to inherently execute this task . Over the years, new and more advanced networks have been developed, with the Autoencoder\n(AE) being one of the main types. Later, Olshausen et al. proposed the creation of\nsparse coding and Ng et al. introduced a sparse penalisation term in the hidden layer,\nto acquire more compact and effective features from lower-dimensional data. For some datasets with complex relationships between characteristics, employing more than one SAE\nis necessary, which is why stacked sparse autoencoders (SSAE) are commonly used .\nNowadays, these types of AE are widely used in various scientific fields, but specifically\nfor structural engineering only a few studies are found, and most are about damage detection on bridges [45–47].

As it is not always possible\nto install them due to the high costs involved, simulations have been carried out based on calibrated models of the track , vehicle and considering their dynamic interaction,\nas well as including the track irregularities.

Including the track irregularities directly in the constraint equations are beneficial since it avoids explicitly considering\nthem in the FEM model. Moreover, it also allows to include the wheel and OOR profiles as a periodic rail irregularity, simplifying the analysis. Thus, before starting the analysis, the\nVSI software imports track irregularities and OOR profiles from a MATLAB file, whichto the vertical and lateral irregularities in each rail in each respective position, and adds it to the constraint equations of the system throughout the dynamics analysis. Then, the\nsystem of dynamic equations is solved using the typical Newmark integration method.\nThe impact of track irregularity on wheel defect classification is significant, as a lower track quality tends to result in a higher likelihood of misclassification. A comprehensive\nexploration of this influence was previously undertaken by Mosleh et al. as documented in their research study . Hence, this study does not delve into the impact of track\nquality; rather, it primarily centres on the utilisation of AI-based methodologies for the detection and classification of wheel defects. For this, four different profiles are used, based\non European Standard EN 13848–2 . In this case, power spectral density (PSD) curvesFor OOR defects, several profiles are defined based on real measurements in representative profiles of the various severities.

To reduce installation and maintenance costs, it is important to reduce the number of sensors without compromising the\nquality of the results.

Based on different crossing speeds, loading schemes and rail irregularities profiles, 120 baseline and 180 damage scenarios (90 for polygonal wheels and 90 for wheel flats) were defined, as summarised in For baseline scenarios, six loading schemes with five different speeds (40, 60, 80, 100\nand 120 km/h) and four rail irregularity profiles were considered, giving a total of 120 scenarios. The loading schemes used are: empty, half-loaded, full-loaded and, additionally,For the damage cases, a total of 90 scenarios were generated for polygonal wheels.

Similarly, 90 scenarios were created for wheel flats, involving 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (F1, F2 and F3) x 10 different irregularitywheel radius . This wave phenomenon can be characterised by the different wavelengths formed (harmonics θ ), and by the levels of irregularity ( Lw ) associated with each of the harmonics. According to Peng , it is considered a polygonal wheel when the wear amplitude assumes values above 0. mm and wavelengths between 140 mm and the wheelTo define scenarios with polygonal wheels for the Laagrss wagon, a literature survey on\nexperimental measurements in defective wheels was conducted . Three experimental irregularity profiles were collected, illustrated in Figure 3. The first group (H6-8)\ncorresponds to a study carried out by Cai et al. with dominant harmonics from 6 to 8;**Figure 3.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) of polygonal wheels with**Figure 4.** Examples of polygonal damage profiles for each of the dominant harmonic intervals.the second group (H12-14) to a study authored by Tao et al. with dominant harmonics from 12 to 14; and the third profile (H17-18) to a study performed by Wu et al. with\nBased on the wheel irregularity spectra ( Lw ) taken from the respective measurement profiles, shown in Figure 3, and considering the contribution of the first 30 harmonics, several irregularity profiles were generated, according to Figure 4.

After obtaining the acceleration measurements from the numerical simulations, an FFT algorithm is applied to the time series allowing the conversion of the signal from the time domain to the frequency domain. Then,predefined hyperparameters of the algorithm. The set hyperparameters are encoding and\ndecoding transfer functions, hidden layer size, maximum number of epochs, L2 weight regularisation term, sparsity regularisation term and a sparsity proportion term. Afterwards,**Figure 7.** Flowchart with the main phases of the methodology for detection and classification of OORthe features are extracted in the more compressed layer of the SAE, the so-called bottleneck layer. The number of features obtained is equal to the number of hidden layers which\nis usually considerably lower than the data size, allowing a compression of the input data.\nFurthermore, to enhance the sensitivity to damage, two levels of data fusion are applied to the bottleneck features using the Mahalanobis distance. In the first level, all features are\nfused into a damage index (DI) for each sensor and, in the second level, all the sensors\nare merged resulting in only one DI for each simulation. Finally, automatic damage detection is achieved by performing an outlier analysis, in which a statistical confidence limit\n(CB) is used, based on the Inverse Cumulative Gaussian Distribution Function (ICDF).\nFor feature classification, an automatic clustering process based on the k-means technique is implemented. This algorithm allows for the unsupervised and automatic classification of data, based on the calculation of statistical distances between objects. In k-means technique given a vector of data and chosen k clusters, the key is to find k centroids that minimise\nthe distance of each vector to its nearest centroid . Since it is necessary to define the number of clusters in advance, a global Silhouette index (SIL) was adopted to make\nan automatic process. At the end, the clusters will allow the classification of the two typesbetween the number of correct classifications and the total number of cases.damage detection problems, as it allows a signal to be converted from the time domain to the frequency domain, to capture the excitation frequencies induced by the wheel defects.\nIn addition, a data reduction is carried out at this stage, since the initial records contain aa crossing speed of 80 km/h. When comparing the FFT spectra for a train passage with flats, Figure 8a), with polygonal wheels, Figure 8b), there are visible differences in terms\nof amplitude peak values and excited frequency ranges. For flats, the amplitude peak values are higher and they induce frequencies in the range between DC and 1500accordance with some authors reports . In terms of severities, for flats, the more severe group (55–100 mm) is the one with the higher frequency content, as expected,a baseline response. For polygonal wheels, from the analysis of Figure 8b), it can be seen the frequency peaks for the H12–14 and H17–18 profiles around 100 and 150\nrespectively, while for the profile H6-8 a more flat spectrum is obtained without showing any significant peak. This can be explained by the irregularity level profile of thisThese two graphs can show which frequencies have higher content in the original signal.Autoencoders are artificial neural networks trained using an unsupervised approach,\nwhich aim first to learn coded representations of the data, compressing the input into\na latent space representation, and second, through this compressed information, reconstructing the information. The basic architecture of this type of network consists of threewhere **Wij**, **Wjk** are the weights connection matrices between input layer-hidden\nlayer and hidden layer-output layer, **X** = ( **X** 1, **X** 2, . . ., **Xn** ) is the input data vector,\n**H** = ( **H** 1, . . ., **Hm** ) is the low-dimensional vector and **X** [ˆ] = ( **X** [ˆ] 1, **X** [ˆ] 2, . . ., **X** [ˆ] **n** ) is the output**Figure 8.** Frequency domain responses on position 1 for the crossing speed of 80 km/h: (a) wheel flats,data vector. **b** 1, **b** 2 are bias vectors and σ 1, σ 2 are the activation function used in each of thereconstruction of the input X [ˆ], as shown in Equation (3).

After incorporating various inputs into the SSAE training, they are integrated into the so-called\n‘Input 1’. As training progresses, the data is compressed, and the main characteristics of the signals are obtained and retained in ‘Bottleneck 1’. Subsequently, these characteristics are\nused as input for training the second sparse autoencoder, which, after further compression,\nenables the extraction of the final features. Depending on the type of data under analysis,\nthe compression level differs, so multiple tests should be conducted to optimise these layer sizes. This optimisation was achieved by trial and test, changing both the size of the first\nIt should be noted that this network architecture, where the dimensions of the layers gradually decrease along the network until reaching the bottleneck layer , has proven\nto be highly robust for the type of data used. It allows for effective compression of results**Figure 9.** Schematic of the structure of the SSAE neural network used in this study.After extracting the features from the bottleneck layer of the SSAE, the difference between the healthy wheels scenarios and the damage wheels scenarios is still not sufficient. Hence\na data fusion is performed. With this fusion, it is possible to increase the sensitivity of the\nfeatures, and as a result, to obtain a damage index (DI) for each simulation. Thus, the Mahalanobis distance (MD) is used to reduce the volume of extracted data and preserve the most relevant information . Briefly, MD is a metric that measures the distance between two points in a feature space consisting of two or more variables, being independent of the\nscale of the features, thus allowing an increase in the sensitivity of the features to cases with damage. The MD, denoted here as DI, is calculated for each simulation using the followingin which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−], and ¯ x is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The MD is calculated for each sensor and for each simulation, obtaining a matrix of n distances per k number of sensors.Finally, the discrimination of the features consists in distinguishing the features as corresponding to a healthy or damaged case. At this stage of the methodology, an analysis of\nabnormal values is carried out, which will allow the condition of the train wheels to beautomatically monitored and these values to be classified into different classes. This phaseThe outlier analysis consists of grouping, by probabilistic distribution processes, the datato the previously created group. For this, a statistical confidence limit (CB) is used, based on the inverse cumulative Gaussian distribution function (ICDF), considering the mean\nvalue, ¯ μ, and standard deviation, σ, of the baseline feature vector.Whenever a value of a DI indicator is equal to or greater than CB, it is considered an outlier (the null hypothesis is rejected), thus representing a case of damage.For feature classification, a clustering process is used to divide the dataset into distinct clusters that should be as compact and separated as possible . For clustering, the k-meanson the distances of their vectors. Recent studies showed that the k-means algorithm has shown promising results . The main limitation of this technique is that it requires\nknowledge of the number of clusters in advance. For this purpose, the global silhouetteThis section presents the main results obtained through the application of the methodology proposed in section 3 to the calculated track responses. The methodology is applied using damaged wheel passages for the three simulated train speeds (60, 80 and 100 km/h),hyperparameters (presented in section 3). By adjusting these hyperparameters, it is possible to make the algorithm more efficient and improve the generalisation capabilities, as only\nthe most important features are retained. The optimisation of these hyperparameters isof data under analysis. Based on the principles of the SAE already outlined in other works\nIn the context of this study, the non-linear transfer functions (logsig) proved to be more effective than the linear ones, being the ones used in all the studied cases. After analysing Table 3, there is a similarity in the hyperparameters when comparing the two types of OOR damage. It is observed that the data compression level is the same for both cases, around\n93%, as 500 features are extracted in Bottleneck 2 from the initial input data with 7000\nConcerning the type of damage situation, the size of the ‘Bottleneck 1’ and ‘Bottleneck\n2’ was increased to bring them even closer to the initial amount of input data. This can beanalysis, making it challenging for the autoencoder to define relationships between the data, hence requiring a larger number. On the contrary, the maximum number of epochsIt is also important to emphasise that of the various hyperparameters presented, theOnce the hyperparameters have been defined, all the steps of the methodology are applied to the new dataset. For simplicity, in this section, only the last phase of the methodology will be presented, namely an outlier analysis for damage detection and cluster analysis for damage classification. For each sensor, a matrix n × m is created, where n\nis the number of test passages (baseline scenarios + damage scenarios), and m represents the number of extracted features. So, the size of the matrices is 210 × 2000 in case of the\ntype of damage, 75 × 500 for each amplitude in polygonal wheel, and 120 × 500 for wheelDespite the visual distinction between healthy and damaged wheels based on the data processing presented in subsection 3.2, unsupervised learning must use strategies capable of automatically detecting damage. To this end, an outlier analysis is employed, which consists of defining a confidence threshold using a significance level of 1% , represented**Figure 10.** Automatic OOR damage detection based on outlier analysis.by the green line in Figure 10. This approach makes it possible to successfully detect allTo distinguish the two types of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed. Figure 11\nshows a clear distinction between the damage, even when using a dataset with three different train speeds (60,80 and 100 km/h).. In the case of Figure 11a), using all four\naccelerometers, it is possible to efficiently separate the set into two large clusters, despite\n30 misclassifications (16 in the polygonisation and 14 in the flats). Even so, the accuracy\npercentage is around 85%, which is a very good result. To analyse the sensitivity to the number of sensors, only two sensors were used, one on each side ). The results\nimproved, with a decrease in the number of misclassifications from 30 to 21 (13 for polygonisation and 8 for flats). One explanation could be the disparity in sensor sensitivity to the damage, where some sensors are more sensitive than others due to their spatial positioning in relation to the damage. By merging the data from the less sensitive sensors with the\nmore sensitive ones, this could have a negative impact on the results. Thus, the percentage\nThe purpose behind presenting these two plots was to demonstrate that, whether using 4 sensors or 2 sensors, the classification remains remarkably robust, showing lowAfter identifying the type of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed once again to\nclassify the severity of each damage separately. Regarding polygonal wheels, the classification involves both amplitude and harmonic orders, leading to the clusters depicted in the obtained clusters reasonably reflect the two amplitude groups, with all misclassifications associated with the H6-8 harmonic cases (17 misclassifications). Once the amplitude\nis identified, harmonic classification must be carried out separately for each of the amplitudes. In Figure 12b), related to amplitude A1, it is observed that the obtained clusters**Figure 11.** Automatic OOR damage classification based on cluster analysis using: a) 4 sensors; b) 2are nearly perfect, with only 3 misclassifications. In Figure 12c), there are only 3 misclassifications, totalling 8 misclassifications in the classification of the number of dominant\nThe classification of harmonic order is only possible with the separation of amplitudes,\nFigure 13 presents the clusters obtained for the wheel flat cases. The separation between\nthe less severe group and baseline cases and intermediate (cluster 3) and severe cases (cluster 4) is reduced, resulting in a total of 19 misclassifications. Nevertheless, this result showsrate of about 84%. One possible reason for this significant number of misclassifications could be directly associated with the number of impacts captured by the sensor.In order to contribute to the safety of railway transportation and service quality, an automatic methodology based on machine learning has been proposed. This methodology can accurately detect and classify two types of OOR wheel damage in railway vehicles allowing to mitigate problems at both track and vehicle level, such as derailments or material\ndegradation. It includes a new technique for feature extraction based on a dedicated neural network, the Sparse Autoencoder. This non-linear technique is an upgrade concerning the commonly used linear techniques for feature extraction since it allows a better normalisation of the operational effects in the analysed data, as well as the reduction of large amounts\nof data without relying on other techniques, while keeping the most valuable information. These improvements are achieved through the use of different hyperparameters in**Figure 12.** Automatic classification of polygonal wheels based on cluster analysis: a) amplitude A1-A2;**Figure 13.** Automatic classification of wheel flats based on cluster analysis.the calculations, such as non-linear activation functions and sparsity terms. Consequently,circulation. Particularly in the railway engineering field, the inclusion of this technique\nshowed a good potential to deal with variable train speeds, essentially due to the amplifying effect on the measured track dynamic responses which could induce errors in damage The application of the methodology to the data set proved to be very successful in detecting and classifying the two types of OOR damages. Damage detection was perfect, without\nany false detection. In terms of classifying the type of damage, the results are very good,\nwith a success rate of around 85%, but if only two accelerometers are considered the successrate increases to around 90%. These results are encouraging since the range of speeds considered in the analysis, between 60 and 100 km/h, is the most representative of in-service\nfreight trains. Also, the results show that including the Sparse Autoencoder has a positive\neffect in the normalization of the train speed in the damage data set.\nRegarding the severity classification for each type of damage, the methodology proved equally successful in clustering the different damage severities. For polygonal wheels, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the severity groups in terms of defect amplitude, failing only for the H6-8 harmonic cases, and in terms of harmonic orders for each amplitude,\nwith almost perfect results. For wheel flats, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the three severity groups, though with some misclassifications between the less severe group\nand baseline cases and between intermediate and severe cases. A success rate of around 86%\nis achieved in the classification of polygonal wheel severities and 84% in the classification of wheel flat severities. Even so, these high success rates of over 80% show the robustness\nof this methodology in damage classification regardless of the train speed.on on-site measurements. Additionally, this methodology could be carried out for other types of railway vehicles, for example, passenger vehicles, since the dynamic responses are\ndifferent from freight vehicles. In that case, exploring other recent types of autoencoders,\nTo increase the complexity of the problem, the objective is to explore the concept of\nmultiple damages (same or different OOR types). For this, it will be necessary to incorporate a new stage in the methodology, the damage location stage, which will make it possible\nto distinguish isolated damage from multiple damage, as well as their respective location.\nThus, damage will be identified using cut signals, which will then be used to classify theThis work is a result of project WAY4SafeRail-WAYside monitoring system FOR SAFE RAIL transportation, with reference NORTE-01-0247-FEDER-069595, co-funded by the European Regional\nDevelopment Fund (ERDF), through the North Portugal Regional Operational Programme\nPartnership Agreement.

However, this type of system entail high costs envisaging the vehicle wheel condition monitoring, since sensors need to be installed in every vehicle in order to achieve a good representativity . On the other hand, wayside systems are a more viable solution for identifying wheel defects, since the condition of allThe most common wheel defects are known as OOR. As the name infers, this defect is related to deformations on the surface of the wheel circumference that make it not round.\nThis deformation can have many forms and different causes, leading to faults on the vehicle and on the track due to the higher dynamic force values [4–6]. The OOR damagesa function of their shape and size, vehicle characteristics and speed [7–10]. Wheel flats induce high dynamic impact loads on the railway infrastructure, which causes significant damage to both tracks and vehicles, such as broken axles, damaged rolling bearings and cracks in the wheels, rails and sleepers . Moreover, it also generates high vibrations\ntransmitted to the rolling stock, inducing significant stresses and causing damage to the In the case of polygonal wheels, the formation mechanism can be roughly classified\ninto three categories, namely, (1) initial wheel defects , (2) a natural vibration of the\nvehicle–track system and (3) thermoelastic instability . The formation mechanism is strongly contingent on the vehicle type and its operational characteristics, withof dominant harmonic orders [19–22]. For example, Tao et al. studied asymmetrical polygonal wear on metro wheels and obtained harmonic orders of 12–14, while another study by Tao et al. found that the most common harmonic order in Chinese freight trains is 18–19. Although a polygonal wheel could generate less impact on the track than a\nwheel flat, this defect can cause serious damage to the track due to resonance effects in the\nTo identify the occurrence of these OOR anomalies in train wheels, innovative\nmethodologies have been developed combining signal processing and automatic learning techniques. These methodologies are based on the extraction of damage sensitivity features, making possible the distinction between undamaged and damaged situations. Recently, many studies have shown good results in detecting OOR damages using\ndistinct approaches [24–29]. Mishra et al. concluded that a single FBG (Fiber Bragg Grating) sensor, positioned along the rail can detect the presence of wheel flats.\nLourenço et al. created an automatic algorithm for diagnosing OOR defects. The\nproposed methodology consists of isolating specific defective wheels and then identifying the severity of the damage, using only acceleration and strain data measured on\nthe track. In another study, Krummenacher et al. , proposed two machine-learningBy extracting the features, it is possible to transform the measured data into an alternative form of information where the correlation with damage is more easily observed. There are various techniques for feature extraction, the most common being CWT\n(continuous wavelet transform) [31–33], PCA (principal component analysis) ,detection of polygonal wheels on freight vehicles using CWT and ARX features, using\n6 accelerometers, 3 on each side of the railway track. Mosleh et al. introduced aflats by extracting AR features from acceleration records. Moreover, Mohammadi et al.\nadopted linear features, particularly, CWT, PCA, ARX and AR, and their research findingsin the context of wheel flat damage detection. Although these studies have demonstrated robust results in detection, they show some limitations in dealing with the non-linear effects associated with operational effects, such as the train speed. Due to the inability of these linear techniques to attenuate operation effects, the inclusion of different speeds\nFor most of these studies, a feature normalisation stage is used when it is necessary to remove the operational effects. Usually, latent variable methods are used, such as PCA or multiple linear regression (MLR) . Thus, to deal with the non-linear phenomena and reduce the large amounts of data without relying on the aforementioned methods,\nthe first artificial neural networks were created to inherently execute this task . Over the years, new and more advanced networks have been developed, with the Autoencoder\n(AE) being one of the main types. Later, Olshausen et al. proposed the creation of\nsparse coding and Ng et al. introduced a sparse penalisation term in the hidden layer,\nto acquire more compact and effective features from lower-dimensional data. For some datasets with complex relationships between characteristics, employing more than one SAE\nis necessary, which is why stacked sparse autoencoders (SSAE) are commonly used .\nNowadays, these types of AE are widely used in various scientific fields, but specifically\nfor structural engineering only a few studies are found, and most are about damage detection on bridges [45–47].

Pathirage et al. proposed a framework utilizing SAE’s potential for dimensionality reduction, which facilitated the assessment of damage detection performance on Many of these AE algorithms already performed feature classification in order to discriminate the different types of damages and severities. However, the AE methods can also be combined with other techniques commonly used to classify the data. They can be used unsupervised methods, in which the model is trained without any labels provided to the\ntraining dataset, such as k-means , self-organising maps (SOM) , isolation forest, gaussian mixture model , k-medoids and cluster analysis , or supervised\nmethods, which assume that the hierarchy of database categories is known, such as NaiveBayes classifiers , k-Nearest Neighbours classifiers , Support Vector Machinetwo types of OOR damages, flats and polygonal wheels, based on acceleration responses obtained from a virtual wayside monitoring system.

The application of sensors on both sides of theTo obtain the responses from the railway track, it is necessary to apply sensors on the track that can measure the dynamic responses of the crossing trains. As it is not always possible\nto install them due to the high costs involved, simulations have been carried out based on calibrated models of the track , vehicle and considering their dynamic interaction,\nas well as including the track irregularities. Simulations include cases with healthy wheelsTo simulate the dynamic interactions between the vehicle and the track, an in-house software VSI – Vehicle-Structure Interaction Analysis is used, which was initially developed by\nNeves et al. and later improved by Montenegro et al. .

Including the track irregularities directly in the constraint equations are beneficial since it avoids explicitly considering\nthem in the FEM model. Moreover, it also allows to include the wheel and OOR profiles as a periodic rail irregularity, simplifying the analysis. Thus, before starting the analysis, the\nVSI software imports track irregularities and OOR profiles from a MATLAB file, whichto the vertical and lateral irregularities in each rail in each respective position, and adds it to the constraint equations of the system throughout the dynamics analysis. Then, the\nsystem of dynamic equations is solved using the typical Newmark integration method.\nThe impact of track irregularity on wheel defect classification is significant, as a lower track quality tends to result in a higher likelihood of misclassification. A comprehensive\nexploration of this influence was previously undertaken by Mosleh et al. as documented in their research study . Hence, this study does not delve into the impact of track\nquality; rather, it primarily centres on the utilisation of AI-based methodologies for the detection and classification of wheel defects. For this, four different profiles are used, based\non European Standard EN 13848–2 .

Subsequently, the structural matrices are imported\nMore details on track and train properties, including additional information on traintrack interaction, can be found in previous publications . Figure 1 shows the\nvehicle–track interaction model schematisation and some details about the train and track\nsubsystems, as well as the track irregularities and wheel-rail contact model.According to the conclusions reached in other studies with this type of damage ,\nthe most promising location of the sensors is on the rail. To reduce installation and maintenance costs, it is important to reduce the number of sensors without compromising the\nquality of the results. Therefore, based on a sensitivity analysis performed during the study,\nonly two vertical unidirectional accelerometers were used on each rail, 4 in total (A1 to A4),\nsince they provided a higher cost–benefit ratio. These sensors are mounted on the rail atdefects, different simulation scenarios with perfect wheels (baseline) and OOR wheels\n(damage) were defined for a five-wagon Laagrss freight train. Based on different crossing speeds, loading schemes and rail irregularities profiles, 120 baseline and 180 damage scenarios (90 for polygonal wheels and 90 for wheel flats) were defined, as summarised in For baseline scenarios, six loading schemes with five different speeds (40, 60, 80, 100\nand 120 km/h) and four rail irregularity profiles were considered, giving a total of 120 scenarios. The loading schemes used are: empty, half-loaded, full-loaded and, additionally,For the damage cases, a total of 90 scenarios were generated for polygonal wheels. These\nscenarios including 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (H1, H2 and H3) x 10 different irregularity profiles within each specified harmonic interval. In these 10 irregularity\nprofiles, based on the defect amplitude, two amplitudes are considered, five simulations for\nA1 and five simulations for A2. Similarly, 90 scenarios were created for wheel flats, involving 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (F1, F2 and F3) x 10 different irregularitywheel radius . This wave phenomenon can be characterised by the different wavelengths formed (harmonics θ ), and by the levels of irregularity ( Lw ) associated with each of the harmonics. According to Peng , it is considered a polygonal wheel when the wear amplitude assumes values above 0. mm and wavelengths between 140 mm and the wheelTo define scenarios with polygonal wheels for the Laagrss wagon, a literature survey on\nexperimental measurements in defective wheels was conducted . Three experimental irregularity profiles were collected, illustrated in Figure 3. The first group (H6-8)\ncorresponds to a study carried out by Cai et al. with dominant harmonics from 6 to 8;**Figure 3.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) of polygonal wheels with**Figure 4.** Examples of polygonal damage profiles for each of the dominant harmonic intervals.the second group (H12-14) to a study authored by Tao et al. with dominant harmonics from 12 to 14; and the third profile (H17-18) to a study performed by Wu et al. with\nBased on the wheel irregularity spectra ( Lw ) taken from the respective measurement profiles, shown in Figure 3, and considering the contribution of the first 30 harmonics, several irregularity profiles were generated, according to Figure 4.

Then,predefined hyperparameters of the algorithm. The set hyperparameters are encoding and\ndecoding transfer functions, hidden layer size, maximum number of epochs, L2 weight regularisation term, sparsity regularisation term and a sparsity proportion term. Afterwards,**Figure 7.** Flowchart with the main phases of the methodology for detection and classification of OORthe features are extracted in the more compressed layer of the SAE, the so-called bottleneck layer. The number of features obtained is equal to the number of hidden layers which\nis usually considerably lower than the data size, allowing a compression of the input data.\nFurthermore, to enhance the sensitivity to damage, two levels of data fusion are applied to the bottleneck features using the Mahalanobis distance. In the first level, all features are\nfused into a damage index (DI) for each sensor and, in the second level, all the sensors\nare merged resulting in only one DI for each simulation. Finally, automatic damage detection is achieved by performing an outlier analysis, in which a statistical confidence limit\n(CB) is used, based on the Inverse Cumulative Gaussian Distribution Function (ICDF).\nFor feature classification, an automatic clustering process based on the k-means technique is implemented. This algorithm allows for the unsupervised and automatic classification of data, based on the calculation of statistical distances between objects. In k-means technique given a vector of data and chosen k clusters, the key is to find k centroids that minimise\nthe distance of each vector to its nearest centroid . Since it is necessary to define the number of clusters in advance, a global Silhouette index (SIL) was adopted to make\nan automatic process. At the end, the clusters will allow the classification of the two typesbetween the number of correct classifications and the total number of cases.damage detection problems, as it allows a signal to be converted from the time domain to the frequency domain, to capture the excitation frequencies induced by the wheel defects.\nIn addition, a data reduction is carried out at this stage, since the initial records contain aa crossing speed of 80 km/h. When comparing the FFT spectra for a train passage with flats, Figure 8a), with polygonal wheels, Figure 8b), there are visible differences in terms\nof amplitude peak values and excited frequency ranges. For flats, the amplitude peak values are higher and they induce frequencies in the range between DC and 1500accordance with some authors reports . In terms of severities, for flats, the more severe group (55–100 mm) is the one with the higher frequency content, as expected,a baseline response. For polygonal wheels, from the analysis of Figure 8b), it can be seen the frequency peaks for the H12–14 and H17–18 profiles around 100 and 150\nrespectively, while for the profile H6-8 a more flat spectrum is obtained without showing any significant peak. This can be explained by the irregularity level profile of thisThese two graphs can show which frequencies have higher content in the original signal.Autoencoders are artificial neural networks trained using an unsupervised approach,\nwhich aim first to learn coded representations of the data, compressing the input into\na latent space representation, and second, through this compressed information, reconstructing the information.

After incorporating various inputs into the SSAE training, they are integrated into the so-called\n‘Input 1’. As training progresses, the data is compressed, and the main characteristics of the signals are obtained and retained in ‘Bottleneck 1’. Subsequently, these characteristics are\nused as input for training the second sparse autoencoder, which, after further compression,\nenables the extraction of the final features. Depending on the type of data under analysis,\nthe compression level differs, so multiple tests should be conducted to optimise these layer sizes. This optimisation was achieved by trial and test, changing both the size of the first\nIt should be noted that this network architecture, where the dimensions of the layers gradually decrease along the network until reaching the bottleneck layer , has proven\nto be highly robust for the type of data used. It allows for effective compression of results**Figure 9.** Schematic of the structure of the SSAE neural network used in this study.After extracting the features from the bottleneck layer of the SSAE, the difference between the healthy wheels scenarios and the damage wheels scenarios is still not sufficient. Hence\na data fusion is performed. With this fusion, it is possible to increase the sensitivity of the\nfeatures, and as a result, to obtain a damage index (DI) for each simulation. Thus, the Mahalanobis distance (MD) is used to reduce the volume of extracted data and preserve the most relevant information . Briefly, MD is a metric that measures the distance between two points in a feature space consisting of two or more variables, being independent of the\nscale of the features, thus allowing an increase in the sensitivity of the features to cases with damage. The MD, denoted here as DI, is calculated for each simulation using the followingin which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−], and ¯ x is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The MD is calculated for each sensor and for each simulation, obtaining a matrix of n distances per k number of sensors.Finally, the discrimination of the features consists in distinguishing the features as corresponding to a healthy or damaged case. At this stage of the methodology, an analysis of\nabnormal values is carried out, which will allow the condition of the train wheels to beautomatically monitored and these values to be classified into different classes. This phaseThe outlier analysis consists of grouping, by probabilistic distribution processes, the datato the previously created group. For this, a statistical confidence limit (CB) is used, based on the inverse cumulative Gaussian distribution function (ICDF), considering the mean\nvalue, ¯ μ, and standard deviation, σ, of the baseline feature vector.Whenever a value of a DI indicator is equal to or greater than CB, it is considered an outlier (the null hypothesis is rejected), thus representing a case of damage.For feature classification, a clustering process is used to divide the dataset into distinct clusters that should be as compact and separated as possible . For clustering, the k-meanson the distances of their vectors. Recent studies showed that the k-means algorithm has shown promising results . The main limitation of this technique is that it requires\nknowledge of the number of clusters in advance. For this purpose, the global silhouetteThis section presents the main results obtained through the application of the methodology proposed in section 3 to the calculated track responses. The methodology is applied using damaged wheel passages for the three simulated train speeds (60, 80 and 100 km/h),hyperparameters (presented in section 3). By adjusting these hyperparameters, it is possible to make the algorithm more efficient and improve the generalisation capabilities, as only\nthe most important features are retained. The optimisation of these hyperparameters isof data under analysis. Based on the principles of the SAE already outlined in other works\nIn the context of this study, the non-linear transfer functions (logsig) proved to be more effective than the linear ones, being the ones used in all the studied cases. After analysing Table 3, there is a similarity in the hyperparameters when comparing the two types of OOR damage. It is observed that the data compression level is the same for both cases, around\n93%, as 500 features are extracted in Bottleneck 2 from the initial input data with 7000\nConcerning the type of damage situation, the size of the ‘Bottleneck 1’ and ‘Bottleneck\n2’ was increased to bring them even closer to the initial amount of input data. This can beanalysis, making it challenging for the autoencoder to define relationships between the data, hence requiring a larger number. On the contrary, the maximum number of epochsIt is also important to emphasise that of the various hyperparameters presented, theOnce the hyperparameters have been defined, all the steps of the methodology are applied to the new dataset. For simplicity, in this section, only the last phase of the methodology will be presented, namely an outlier analysis for damage detection and cluster analysis for damage classification. For each sensor, a matrix n × m is created, where n\nis the number of test passages (baseline scenarios + damage scenarios), and m represents the number of extracted features. So, the size of the matrices is 210 × 2000 in case of the\ntype of damage, 75 × 500 for each amplitude in polygonal wheel, and 120 × 500 for wheelDespite the visual distinction between healthy and damaged wheels based on the data processing presented in subsection 3.2, unsupervised learning must use strategies capable of automatically detecting damage. To this end, an outlier analysis is employed, which consists of defining a confidence threshold using a significance level of 1% , represented**Figure 10.** Automatic OOR damage detection based on outlier analysis.by the green line in Figure 10. This approach makes it possible to successfully detect allTo distinguish the two types of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed. Figure 11\nshows a clear distinction between the damage, even when using a dataset with three different train speeds (60,80 and 100 km/h).. In the case of Figure 11a), using all four\naccelerometers, it is possible to efficiently separate the set into two large clusters, despite\n30 misclassifications (16 in the polygonisation and 14 in the flats). Even so, the accuracy\npercentage is around 85%, which is a very good result. To analyse the sensitivity to the number of sensors, only two sensors were used, one on each side ). The results\nimproved, with a decrease in the number of misclassifications from 30 to 21 (13 for polygonisation and 8 for flats). One explanation could be the disparity in sensor sensitivity to the damage, where some sensors are more sensitive than others due to their spatial positioning in relation to the damage. By merging the data from the less sensitive sensors with the\nmore sensitive ones, this could have a negative impact on the results. Thus, the percentage\nThe purpose behind presenting these two plots was to demonstrate that, whether using 4 sensors or 2 sensors, the classification remains remarkably robust, showing lowAfter identifying the type of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed once again to\nclassify the severity of each damage separately. Regarding polygonal wheels, the classification involves both amplitude and harmonic orders, leading to the clusters depicted in the obtained clusters reasonably reflect the two amplitude groups, with all misclassifications associated with the H6-8 harmonic cases (17 misclassifications). Once the amplitude\nis identified, harmonic classification must be carried out separately for each of the amplitudes. In Figure 12b), related to amplitude A1, it is observed that the obtained clusters**Figure 11.** Automatic OOR damage classification based on cluster analysis using: a) 4 sensors; b) 2are nearly perfect, with only 3 misclassifications. In Figure 12c), there are only 3 misclassifications, totalling 8 misclassifications in the classification of the number of dominant\nThe classification of harmonic order is only possible with the separation of amplitudes,\nFigure 13 presents the clusters obtained for the wheel flat cases. The separation between\nthe less severe group and baseline cases and intermediate (cluster 3) and severe cases (cluster 4) is reduced, resulting in a total of 19 misclassifications. Nevertheless, this result showsrate of about 84%. One possible reason for this significant number of misclassifications could be directly associated with the number of impacts captured by the sensor.In order to contribute to the safety of railway transportation and service quality, an automatic methodology based on machine learning has been proposed. This methodology can accurately detect and classify two types of OOR wheel damage in railway vehicles allowing to mitigate problems at both track and vehicle level, such as derailments or material\ndegradation. It includes a new technique for feature extraction based on a dedicated neural network, the Sparse Autoencoder. This non-linear technique is an upgrade concerning the commonly used linear techniques for feature extraction since it allows a better normalisation of the operational effects in the analysed data, as well as the reduction of large amounts\nof data without relying on other techniques, while keeping the most valuable information. These improvements are achieved through the use of different hyperparameters in**Figure 12.** Automatic classification of polygonal wheels based on cluster analysis: a) amplitude A1-A2;**Figure 13.** Automatic classification of wheel flats based on cluster analysis.the calculations, such as non-linear activation functions and sparsity terms. Consequently,circulation. Particularly in the railway engineering field, the inclusion of this technique\nshowed a good potential to deal with variable train speeds, essentially due to the amplifying effect on the measured track dynamic responses which could induce errors in damage The application of the methodology to the data set proved to be very successful in detecting and classifying the two types of OOR damages. Damage detection was perfect, without\nany false detection. In terms of classifying the type of damage, the results are very good,\nwith a success rate of around 85%, but if only two accelerometers are considered the successrate increases to around 90%. These results are encouraging since the range of speeds considered in the analysis, between 60 and 100 km/h, is the most representative of in-service\nfreight trains. Also, the results show that including the Sparse Autoencoder has a positive\neffect in the normalization of the train speed in the damage data set.\nRegarding the severity classification for each type of damage, the methodology proved equally successful in clustering the different damage severities. For polygonal wheels, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the severity groups in terms of defect amplitude, failing only for the H6-8 harmonic cases, and in terms of harmonic orders for each amplitude,\nwith almost perfect results. For wheel flats, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the three severity groups, though with some misclassifications between the less severe group\nand baseline cases and between intermediate and severe cases. A success rate of around 86%\nis achieved in the classification of polygonal wheel severities and 84% in the classification of wheel flat severities. Even so, these high success rates of over 80% show the robustness\nof this methodology in damage classification regardless of the train speed.on on-site measurements. Additionally, this methodology could be carried out for other types of railway vehicles, for example, passenger vehicles, since the dynamic responses are\ndifferent from freight vehicles. In that case, exploring other recent types of autoencoders,\nTo increase the complexity of the problem, the objective is to explore the concept of\nmultiple damages (same or different OOR types). For this, it will be necessary to incorporate a new stage in the methodology, the damage location stage, which will make it possible\nto distinguish isolated damage from multiple damage, as well as their respective location.\nThus, damage will be identified using cut signals, which will then be used to classify theThis work is a result of project WAY4SafeRail-WAYside monitoring system FOR SAFE RAIL transportation, with reference NORTE-01-0247-FEDER-069595, co-funded by the European Regional\nDevelopment Fund (ERDF), through the North Portugal Regional Operational Programme\nPartnership Agreement.

Within this context,\nan unsupervised methodology based on artificial intelligence techniques is presented, which allows the detection and classification of wheels, based on dynamic responses induced on the track by crossing freight railway vehicles. The methodology involves the following\nsteps: (i) data collection and pre-processing, (ii) feature extraction (iii)\ndata fusion and (iv) feature discrimination. In the first phase, an FFT\nalgorithm is applied to the acceleration track responses. Then, features are extracted after training a Stacked Sparse Autoencoder, in which the main features of the responses are obtained after a compression stage using an encoder network. This lower dimensional\nlayer forces the model to learn a compression of the input data. Then,\nwhich enhances the sensitivity to the damage recognition. Posteriorly, an outlier analysis is performed to distinguish a healthy wheelRail vehicle wheels are subjected to constant wear and tear due to continuous use and inadequate maintenance plans. Over time, this wear and tear can generate more significant defects, so it is extremely important to use sensing to understand when maintenance of both the track and rolling stock is required. Over the last few decades, researchers havewayside systems, being the main difference in the location of the measuring devices. MostThe Author(s).

However, this type of system entail high costs envisaging the vehicle wheel condition monitoring, since sensors need to be installed in every vehicle in order to achieve a good representativity . On the other hand, wayside systems are a more viable solution for identifying wheel defects, since the condition of allThe most common wheel defects are known as OOR. As the name infers, this defect is related to deformations on the surface of the wheel circumference that make it not round.\nThis deformation can have many forms and different causes, leading to faults on the vehicle and on the track due to the higher dynamic force values [4–6]. The OOR damagesa function of their shape and size, vehicle characteristics and speed [7–10]. Wheel flats induce high dynamic impact loads on the railway infrastructure, which causes significant damage to both tracks and vehicles, such as broken axles, damaged rolling bearings and cracks in the wheels, rails and sleepers . Moreover, it also generates high vibrations\ntransmitted to the rolling stock, inducing significant stresses and causing damage to the In the case of polygonal wheels, the formation mechanism can be roughly classified\ninto three categories, namely, (1) initial wheel defects , (2) a natural vibration of the\nvehicle–track system and (3) thermoelastic instability . The formation mechanism is strongly contingent on the vehicle type and its operational characteristics, withof dominant harmonic orders [19–22]. For example, Tao et al. studied asymmetrical polygonal wear on metro wheels and obtained harmonic orders of 12–14, while another study by Tao et al. found that the most common harmonic order in Chinese freight trains is 18–19. Although a polygonal wheel could generate less impact on the track than a\nwheel flat, this defect can cause serious damage to the track due to resonance effects in the\nTo identify the occurrence of these OOR anomalies in train wheels, innovative\nmethodologies have been developed combining signal processing and automatic learning techniques. These methodologies are based on the extraction of damage sensitivity features, making possible the distinction between undamaged and damaged situations. Recently, many studies have shown good results in detecting OOR damages using\ndistinct approaches [24–29]. Mishra et al. concluded that a single FBG (Fiber Bragg Grating) sensor, positioned along the rail can detect the presence of wheel flats.\nLourenço et al. created an automatic algorithm for diagnosing OOR defects. The\nproposed methodology consists of isolating specific defective wheels and then identifying the severity of the damage, using only acceleration and strain data measured on\nthe track. In another study, Krummenacher et al. , proposed two machine-learningBy extracting the features, it is possible to transform the measured data into an alternative form of information where the correlation with damage is more easily observed. There are various techniques for feature extraction, the most common being CWT\n(continuous wavelet transform) [31–33], PCA (principal component analysis) ,detection of polygonal wheels on freight vehicles using CWT and ARX features, using\n6 accelerometers, 3 on each side of the railway track. Mosleh et al. introduced aflats by extracting AR features from acceleration records. Moreover, Mohammadi et al.\nadopted linear features, particularly, CWT, PCA, ARX and AR, and their research findingsin the context of wheel flat damage detection. Although these studies have demonstrated robust results in detection, they show some limitations in dealing with the non-linear effects associated with operational effects, such as the train speed. Due to the inability of these linear techniques to attenuate operation effects, the inclusion of different speeds\nFor most of these studies, a feature normalisation stage is used when it is necessary to remove the operational effects. Usually, latent variable methods are used, such as PCA or multiple linear regression (MLR) . Thus, to deal with the non-linear phenomena and reduce the large amounts of data without relying on the aforementioned methods,\nthe first artificial neural networks were created to inherently execute this task . Over the years, new and more advanced networks have been developed, with the Autoencoder\n(AE) being one of the main types. Later, Olshausen et al. proposed the creation of\nsparse coding and Ng et al. introduced a sparse penalisation term in the hidden layer,\nto acquire more compact and effective features from lower-dimensional data. For some datasets with complex relationships between characteristics, employing more than one SAE\nis necessary, which is why stacked sparse autoencoders (SSAE) are commonly used .\nNowadays, these types of AE are widely used in various scientific fields, but specifically\nfor structural engineering only a few studies are found, and most are about damage detection on bridges [45–47]. Amaral et al. , proposed an approach for detecting structural anomalies based on SAE and Shewhart’s T control chart. The characteristics extracted byin structures. In another similar study, Amaral et al. , applied the same approach to\na numerical model of a highway viaduct in Brazil reaching more than 99% of successful classifications of structural damage with the combination of SAE and Support Vector Machine. Pathirage et al. proposed a framework utilizing SAE’s potential for dimensionality reduction, which facilitated the assessment of damage detection performance on Many of these AE algorithms already performed feature classification in order to discriminate the different types of damages and severities. However, the AE methods can also be combined with other techniques commonly used to classify the data. They can be used unsupervised methods, in which the model is trained without any labels provided to the\ntraining dataset, such as k-means , self-organising maps (SOM) , isolation forest, gaussian mixture model , k-medoids and cluster analysis , or supervised\nmethods, which assume that the hierarchy of database categories is known, such as NaiveBayes classifiers , k-Nearest Neighbours classifiers , Support Vector Machinetwo types of OOR damages, flats and polygonal wheels, based on acceleration responses obtained from a virtual wayside monitoring system.

The application of sensors on both sides of theTo obtain the responses from the railway track, it is necessary to apply sensors on the track that can measure the dynamic responses of the crossing trains. As it is not always possible\nto install them due to the high costs involved, simulations have been carried out based on calibrated models of the track , vehicle and considering their dynamic interaction,\nas well as including the track irregularities. Simulations include cases with healthy wheelsTo simulate the dynamic interactions between the vehicle and the track, an in-house software VSI – Vehicle-Structure Interaction Analysis is used, which was initially developed by\nNeves et al. and later improved by Montenegro et al. .

The vehicle model integrates spring elements to simulate suspensions, mass elements to represent the mass and\ninertia at the centre of gravity of the wagon components. For the structural connection of these elements, rigid beam elements are adopted. Table 1 outlines the properties of the The Hertzian theory is applied to calculate the normal contact forces, while the USETABthe train to the track in the VSI software. Using Lagrange multipliers, this tool connects\nwheel displacements with the track nodal displacements, incorporating track irregularities and OOR profiles through a set of constraint equations. These equations are solved\nalongside equilibrium equations, forming a unified system that couples the two subsystems\n. Including the track irregularities directly in the constraint equations are beneficial since it avoids explicitly considering\nthem in the FEM model. Moreover, it also allows to include the wheel and OOR profiles as a periodic rail irregularity, simplifying the analysis. Thus, before starting the analysis, the\nVSI software imports track irregularities and OOR profiles from a MATLAB file, whichto the vertical and lateral irregularities in each rail in each respective position, and adds it to the constraint equations of the system throughout the dynamics analysis. Then, the\nsystem of dynamic equations is solved using the typical Newmark integration method.\nThe impact of track irregularity on wheel defect classification is significant, as a lower track quality tends to result in a higher likelihood of misclassification. A comprehensive\nexploration of this influence was previously undertaken by Mosleh et al. as documented in their research study . Hence, this study does not delve into the impact of track\nquality; rather, it primarily centres on the utilisation of AI-based methodologies for the detection and classification of wheel defects. For this, four different profiles are used, based\non European Standard EN 13848–2 . In this case, power spectral density (PSD) curvesFor OOR defects, several profiles are defined based on real measurements in representative profiles of the various severities. Subsequently, the structural matrices are imported\nMore details on track and train properties, including additional information on traintrack interaction, can be found in previous publications . Figure 1 shows the\nvehicle–track interaction model schematisation and some details about the train and track\nsubsystems, as well as the track irregularities and wheel-rail contact model.According to the conclusions reached in other studies with this type of damage ,\nthe most promising location of the sensors is on the rail. To reduce installation and maintenance costs, it is important to reduce the number of sensors without compromising the\nquality of the results. Therefore, based on a sensitivity analysis performed during the study,\nonly two vertical unidirectional accelerometers were used on each rail, 4 in total (A1 to A4),\nsince they provided a higher cost–benefit ratio. These sensors are mounted on the rail atdefects, different simulation scenarios with perfect wheels (baseline) and OOR wheels\n(damage) were defined for a five-wagon Laagrss freight train. Based on different crossing speeds, loading schemes and rail irregularities profiles, 120 baseline and 180 damage scenarios (90 for polygonal wheels and 90 for wheel flats) were defined, as summarised in For baseline scenarios, six loading schemes with five different speeds (40, 60, 80, 100\nand 120 km/h) and four rail irregularity profiles were considered, giving a total of 120 scenarios. The loading schemes used are: empty, half-loaded, full-loaded and, additionally,For the damage cases, a total of 90 scenarios were generated for polygonal wheels. These\nscenarios including 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (H1, H2 and H3) x 10 different irregularity profiles within each specified harmonic interval. In these 10 irregularity\nprofiles, based on the defect amplitude, two amplitudes are considered, five simulations for\nA1 and five simulations for A2. Similarly, 90 scenarios were created for wheel flats, involving 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (F1, F2 and F3) x 10 different irregularitywheel radius . This wave phenomenon can be characterised by the different wavelengths formed (harmonics θ ), and by the levels of irregularity ( Lw ) associated with each of the harmonics. According to Peng , it is considered a polygonal wheel when the wear amplitude assumes values above 0. mm and wavelengths between 140 mm and the wheelTo define scenarios with polygonal wheels for the Laagrss wagon, a literature survey on\nexperimental measurements in defective wheels was conducted . Three experimental irregularity profiles were collected, illustrated in Figure 3. The first group (H6-8)\ncorresponds to a study carried out by Cai et al. with dominant harmonics from 6 to 8;**Figure 3.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) of polygonal wheels with**Figure 4.** Examples of polygonal damage profiles for each of the dominant harmonic intervals.the second group (H12-14) to a study authored by Tao et al. with dominant harmonics from 12 to 14; and the third profile (H17-18) to a study performed by Wu et al. with\nBased on the wheel irregularity spectra ( Lw ) taken from the respective measurement profiles, shown in Figure 3, and considering the contribution of the first 30 harmonics, several irregularity profiles were generated, according to Figure 4.

A less severe group, with a 10–20 mm length, an intermediate group, with a 25–50 mm length and a more severe case, with a 55–100 mm length. The irregularity profiles are generated randomly, but in this case, in function of two geometric\nvariables, the length and the depth of the flat. More details about the process of generation of flat profiles can be found in the study performed by Mosleh et al .

The sampling frequency for data acquisition is considered 10 kHz in order to ensure a good problem Figure 6a) shows two baseline cases for two speeds (40 and 100 km/h), where it is possible to observe the influence of speed on the dynamic response. The amplifying effect\nof speed can influence the identification of damage, which is why a robust baseline with a wide range of scenarios is very important. At a speed of 40 km/h, lower accelerations\naround 0. m/s⊃2 are observed. In contrast, at a speed of 100 km/h (considerably higher),\naccelerations increase substantially to around 3. m/s⊃2. This illustrates the significant**Figure 6.** Acceleration time-series in sensor A1 for Laagrss vehicle: (a) influence of speed, (b) influencehigher speeds.

After obtaining the acceleration measurements from the numerical simulations, an FFT algorithm is applied to the time series allowing the conversion of the signal from the time domain to the frequency domain. Then,predefined hyperparameters of the algorithm. The set hyperparameters are encoding and\ndecoding transfer functions, hidden layer size, maximum number of epochs, L2 weight regularisation term, sparsity regularisation term and a sparsity proportion term. Afterwards,**Figure 7.** Flowchart with the main phases of the methodology for detection and classification of OORthe features are extracted in the more compressed layer of the SAE, the so-called bottleneck layer. The number of features obtained is equal to the number of hidden layers which\nis usually considerably lower than the data size, allowing a compression of the input data.\nFurthermore, to enhance the sensitivity to damage, two levels of data fusion are applied to the bottleneck features using the Mahalanobis distance. In the first level, all features are\nfused into a damage index (DI) for each sensor and, in the second level, all the sensors\nare merged resulting in only one DI for each simulation. Finally, automatic damage detection is achieved by performing an outlier analysis, in which a statistical confidence limit\n(CB) is used, based on the Inverse Cumulative Gaussian Distribution Function (ICDF).\nFor feature classification, an automatic clustering process based on the k-means technique is implemented. This algorithm allows for the unsupervised and automatic classification of data, based on the calculation of statistical distances between objects. In k-means technique given a vector of data and chosen k clusters, the key is to find k centroids that minimise\nthe distance of each vector to its nearest centroid . Since it is necessary to define the number of clusters in advance, a global Silhouette index (SIL) was adopted to make\nan automatic process. At the end, the clusters will allow the classification of the two typesbetween the number of correct classifications and the total number of cases.damage detection problems, as it allows a signal to be converted from the time domain to the frequency domain, to capture the excitation frequencies induced by the wheel defects.\nIn addition, a data reduction is carried out at this stage, since the initial records contain aa crossing speed of 80 km/h. When comparing the FFT spectra for a train passage with flats, Figure 8a), with polygonal wheels, Figure 8b), there are visible differences in terms\nof amplitude peak values and excited frequency ranges. For flats, the amplitude peak values are higher and they induce frequencies in the range between DC and 1500accordance with some authors reports . In terms of severities, for flats, the more severe group (55–100 mm) is the one with the higher frequency content, as expected,a baseline response. For polygonal wheels, from the analysis of Figure 8b), it can be seen the frequency peaks for the H12–14 and H17–18 profiles around 100 and 150\nrespectively, while for the profile H6-8 a more flat spectrum is obtained without showing any significant peak. This can be explained by the irregularity level profile of thisThese two graphs can show which frequencies have higher content in the original signal.Autoencoders are artificial neural networks trained using an unsupervised approach,\nwhich aim first to learn coded representations of the data, compressing the input into\na latent space representation, and second, through this compressed information, reconstructing the information. The basic architecture of this type of network consists of threewhere **Wij**, **Wjk** are the weights connection matrices between input layer-hidden\nlayer and hidden layer-output layer, **X** = ( **X** 1, **X** 2, . . ., **Xn** ) is the input data vector,\n**H** = ( **H** 1, . . ., **Hm** ) is the low-dimensional vector and **X** [ˆ] = ( **X** [ˆ] 1, **X** [ˆ] 2, . . ., **X** [ˆ] **n** ) is the output**Figure 8.** Frequency domain responses on position 1 for the crossing speed of 80 km/h: (a) wheel flats,data vector. **b** 1, **b** 2 are bias vectors and σ 1, σ 2 are the activation function used in each of thereconstruction of the input X [ˆ], as shown in Equation (3).

After incorporating various inputs into the SSAE training, they are integrated into the so-called\n‘Input 1’. As training progresses, the data is compressed, and the main characteristics of the signals are obtained and retained in ‘Bottleneck 1’. Subsequently, these characteristics are\nused as input for training the second sparse autoencoder, which, after further compression,\nenables the extraction of the final features. Depending on the type of data under analysis,\nthe compression level differs, so multiple tests should be conducted to optimise these layer sizes. This optimisation was achieved by trial and test, changing both the size of the first\nIt should be noted that this network architecture, where the dimensions of the layers gradually decrease along the network until reaching the bottleneck layer , has proven\nto be highly robust for the type of data used. It allows for effective compression of results**Figure 9.** Schematic of the structure of the SSAE neural network used in this study.After extracting the features from the bottleneck layer of the SSAE, the difference between the healthy wheels scenarios and the damage wheels scenarios is still not sufficient. Hence\na data fusion is performed. With this fusion, it is possible to increase the sensitivity of the\nfeatures, and as a result, to obtain a damage index (DI) for each simulation. Thus, the Mahalanobis distance (MD) is used to reduce the volume of extracted data and preserve the most relevant information . Briefly, MD is a metric that measures the distance between two points in a feature space consisting of two or more variables, being independent of the\nscale of the features, thus allowing an increase in the sensitivity of the features to cases with damage. The MD, denoted here as DI, is calculated for each simulation using the followingin which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−], and ¯ x is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The MD is calculated for each sensor and for each simulation, obtaining a matrix of n distances per k number of sensors.Finally, the discrimination of the features consists in distinguishing the features as corresponding to a healthy or damaged case. At this stage of the methodology, an analysis of\nabnormal values is carried out, which will allow the condition of the train wheels to beautomatically monitored and these values to be classified into different classes. This phaseThe outlier analysis consists of grouping, by probabilistic distribution processes, the datato the previously created group. For this, a statistical confidence limit (CB) is used, based on the inverse cumulative Gaussian distribution function (ICDF), considering the mean\nvalue, ¯ μ, and standard deviation, σ, of the baseline feature vector.Whenever a value of a DI indicator is equal to or greater than CB, it is considered an outlier (the null hypothesis is rejected), thus representing a case of damage.For feature classification, a clustering process is used to divide the dataset into distinct clusters that should be as compact and separated as possible . For clustering, the k-meanson the distances of their vectors. Recent studies showed that the k-means algorithm has shown promising results . The main limitation of this technique is that it requires\nknowledge of the number of clusters in advance. For this purpose, the global silhouetteThis section presents the main results obtained through the application of the methodology proposed in section 3 to the calculated track responses. The methodology is applied using damaged wheel passages for the three simulated train speeds (60, 80 and 100 km/h),hyperparameters (presented in section 3). By adjusting these hyperparameters, it is possible to make the algorithm more efficient and improve the generalisation capabilities, as only\nthe most important features are retained. The optimisation of these hyperparameters isof data under analysis. Based on the principles of the SAE already outlined in other works\nIn the context of this study, the non-linear transfer functions (logsig) proved to be more effective than the linear ones, being the ones used in all the studied cases. After analysing Table 3, there is a similarity in the hyperparameters when comparing the two types of OOR damage. It is observed that the data compression level is the same for both cases, around\n93%, as 500 features are extracted in Bottleneck 2 from the initial input data with 7000\nConcerning the type of damage situation, the size of the ‘Bottleneck 1’ and ‘Bottleneck\n2’ was increased to bring them even closer to the initial amount of input data. This can beanalysis, making it challenging for the autoencoder to define relationships between the data, hence requiring a larger number. On the contrary, the maximum number of epochsIt is also important to emphasise that of the various hyperparameters presented, theOnce the hyperparameters have been defined, all the steps of the methodology are applied to the new dataset. For simplicity, in this section, only the last phase of the methodology will be presented, namely an outlier analysis for damage detection and cluster analysis for damage classification. For each sensor, a matrix n × m is created, where n\nis the number of test passages (baseline scenarios + damage scenarios), and m represents the number of extracted features. So, the size of the matrices is 210 × 2000 in case of the\ntype of damage, 75 × 500 for each amplitude in polygonal wheel, and 120 × 500 for wheelDespite the visual distinction between healthy and damaged wheels based on the data processing presented in subsection 3.2, unsupervised learning must use strategies capable of automatically detecting damage. To this end, an outlier analysis is employed, which consists of defining a confidence threshold using a significance level of 1% , represented**Figure 10.** Automatic OOR damage detection based on outlier analysis.by the green line in Figure 10. This approach makes it possible to successfully detect allTo distinguish the two types of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed. Figure 11\nshows a clear distinction between the damage, even when using a dataset with three different train speeds (60,80 and 100 km/h).. In the case of Figure 11a), using all four\naccelerometers, it is possible to efficiently separate the set into two large clusters, despite\n30 misclassifications (16 in the polygonisation and 14 in the flats). Even so, the accuracy\npercentage is around 85%, which is a very good result. To analyse the sensitivity to the number of sensors, only two sensors were used, one on each side ). The results\nimproved, with a decrease in the number of misclassifications from 30 to 21 (13 for polygonisation and 8 for flats). One explanation could be the disparity in sensor sensitivity to the damage, where some sensors are more sensitive than others due to their spatial positioning in relation to the damage. By merging the data from the less sensitive sensors with the\nmore sensitive ones, this could have a negative impact on the results. Thus, the percentage\nThe purpose behind presenting these two plots was to demonstrate that, whether using 4 sensors or 2 sensors, the classification remains remarkably robust, showing lowAfter identifying the type of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed once again to\nclassify the severity of each damage separately. Regarding polygonal wheels, the classification involves both amplitude and harmonic orders, leading to the clusters depicted in the obtained clusters reasonably reflect the two amplitude groups, with all misclassifications associated with the H6-8 harmonic cases (17 misclassifications). Once the amplitude\nis identified, harmonic classification must be carried out separately for each of the amplitudes. In Figure 12b), related to amplitude A1, it is observed that the obtained clusters**Figure 11.** Automatic OOR damage classification based on cluster analysis using: a) 4 sensors; b) 2are nearly perfect, with only 3 misclassifications. In Figure 12c), there are only 3 misclassifications, totalling 8 misclassifications in the classification of the number of dominant\nThe classification of harmonic order is only possible with the separation of amplitudes,\nFigure 13 presents the clusters obtained for the wheel flat cases. The separation between\nthe less severe group and baseline cases and intermediate (cluster 3) and severe cases (cluster 4) is reduced, resulting in a total of 19 misclassifications. Nevertheless, this result showsrate of about 84%. One possible reason for this significant number of misclassifications could be directly associated with the number of impacts captured by the sensor.In order to contribute to the safety of railway transportation and service quality, an automatic methodology based on machine learning has been proposed. This methodology can accurately detect and classify two types of OOR wheel damage in railway vehicles allowing to mitigate problems at both track and vehicle level, such as derailments or material\ndegradation. It includes a new technique for feature extraction based on a dedicated neural network, the Sparse Autoencoder. This non-linear technique is an upgrade concerning the commonly used linear techniques for feature extraction since it allows a better normalisation of the operational effects in the analysed data, as well as the reduction of large amounts\nof data without relying on other techniques, while keeping the most valuable information. These improvements are achieved through the use of different hyperparameters in**Figure 12.** Automatic classification of polygonal wheels based on cluster analysis: a) amplitude A1-A2;**Figure 13.** Automatic classification of wheel flats based on cluster analysis.the calculations, such as non-linear activation functions and sparsity terms. Consequently,circulation. Particularly in the railway engineering field, the inclusion of this technique\nshowed a good potential to deal with variable train speeds, essentially due to the amplifying effect on the measured track dynamic responses which could induce errors in damage The application of the methodology to the data set proved to be very successful in detecting and classifying the two types of OOR damages. Damage detection was perfect, without\nany false detection. In terms of classifying the type of damage, the results are very good,\nwith a success rate of around 85%, but if only two accelerometers are considered the successrate increases to around 90%. These results are encouraging since the range of speeds considered in the analysis, between 60 and 100 km/h, is the most representative of in-service\nfreight trains. Also, the results show that including the Sparse Autoencoder has a positive\neffect in the normalization of the train speed in the damage data set.\nRegarding the severity classification for each type of damage, the methodology proved equally successful in clustering the different damage severities. For polygonal wheels, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the severity groups in terms of defect amplitude, failing only for the H6-8 harmonic cases, and in terms of harmonic orders for each amplitude,\nwith almost perfect results. For wheel flats, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the three severity groups, though with some misclassifications between the less severe group\nand baseline cases and between intermediate and severe cases. A success rate of around 86%\nis achieved in the classification of polygonal wheel severities and 84% in the classification of wheel flat severities. Even so, these high success rates of over 80% show the robustness\nof this methodology in damage classification regardless of the train speed.on on-site measurements. Additionally, this methodology could be carried out for other types of railway vehicles, for example, passenger vehicles, since the dynamic responses are\ndifferent from freight vehicles. In that case, exploring other recent types of autoencoders,\nTo increase the complexity of the problem, the objective is to explore the concept of\nmultiple damages (same or different OOR types). For this, it will be necessary to incorporate a new stage in the methodology, the damage location stage, which will make it possible\nto distinguish isolated damage from multiple damage, as well as their respective location.\nThus, damage will be identified using cut signals, which will then be used to classify theThis work is a result of project WAY4SafeRail-WAYside monitoring system FOR SAFE RAIL transportation, with reference NORTE-01-0247-FEDER-069595, co-funded by the European Regional\nDevelopment Fund (ERDF), through the North Portugal Regional Operational Programme\nPartnership Agreement.

Within this context,\nan unsupervised methodology based on artificial intelligence techniques is presented, which allows the detection and classification of wheels, based on dynamic responses induced on the track by crossing freight railway vehicles. The methodology involves the following\nsteps: (i) data collection and pre-processing, (ii) feature extraction (iii)\ndata fusion and (iv) feature discrimination.

Posteriorly, an outlier analysis is performed to distinguish a healthy wheelRail vehicle wheels are subjected to constant wear and tear due to continuous use and inadequate maintenance plans. Over time, this wear and tear can generate more significant defects, so it is extremely important to use sensing to understand when maintenance of both the track and rolling stock is required.

However, this type of system entail high costs envisaging the vehicle wheel condition monitoring, since sensors need to be installed in every vehicle in order to achieve a good representativity . On the other hand, wayside systems are a more viable solution for identifying wheel defects, since the condition of allThe most common wheel defects are known as OOR. As the name infers, this defect is related to deformations on the surface of the wheel circumference that make it not round.\nThis deformation can have many forms and different causes, leading to faults on the vehicle and on the track due to the higher dynamic force values [4–6]. The OOR damagesa function of their shape and size, vehicle characteristics and speed [7–10]. Wheel flats induce high dynamic impact loads on the railway infrastructure, which causes significant damage to both tracks and vehicles, such as broken axles, damaged rolling bearings and cracks in the wheels, rails and sleepers . Moreover, it also generates high vibrations\ntransmitted to the rolling stock, inducing significant stresses and causing damage to the In the case of polygonal wheels, the formation mechanism can be roughly classified\ninto three categories, namely, (1) initial wheel defects , (2) a natural vibration of the\nvehicle–track system and (3) thermoelastic instability . The formation mechanism is strongly contingent on the vehicle type and its operational characteristics, withof dominant harmonic orders [19–22]. For example, Tao et al. studied asymmetrical polygonal wear on metro wheels and obtained harmonic orders of 12–14, while another study by Tao et al. found that the most common harmonic order in Chinese freight trains is 18–19. Although a polygonal wheel could generate less impact on the track than a\nwheel flat, this defect can cause serious damage to the track due to resonance effects in the\nTo identify the occurrence of these OOR anomalies in train wheels, innovative\nmethodologies have been developed combining signal processing and automatic learning techniques. These methodologies are based on the extraction of damage sensitivity features, making possible the distinction between undamaged and damaged situations. Recently, many studies have shown good results in detecting OOR damages using\ndistinct approaches [24–29]. Mishra et al. concluded that a single FBG (Fiber Bragg Grating) sensor, positioned along the rail can detect the presence of wheel flats.\nLourenço et al. created an automatic algorithm for diagnosing OOR defects. The\nproposed methodology consists of isolating specific defective wheels and then identifying the severity of the damage, using only acceleration and strain data measured on\nthe track. In another study, Krummenacher et al. , proposed two machine-learningBy extracting the features, it is possible to transform the measured data into an alternative form of information where the correlation with damage is more easily observed. There are various techniques for feature extraction, the most common being CWT\n(continuous wavelet transform) [31–33], PCA (principal component analysis) ,detection of polygonal wheels on freight vehicles using CWT and ARX features, using\n6 accelerometers, 3 on each side of the railway track. Mosleh et al. introduced aflats by extracting AR features from acceleration records. Moreover, Mohammadi et al.\nadopted linear features, particularly, CWT, PCA, ARX and AR, and their research findingsin the context of wheel flat damage detection. Although these studies have demonstrated robust results in detection, they show some limitations in dealing with the non-linear effects associated with operational effects, such as the train speed. Due to the inability of these linear techniques to attenuate operation effects, the inclusion of different speeds\nFor most of these studies, a feature normalisation stage is used when it is necessary to remove the operational effects. Usually, latent variable methods are used, such as PCA or multiple linear regression (MLR) . Thus, to deal with the non-linear phenomena and reduce the large amounts of data without relying on the aforementioned methods,\nthe first artificial neural networks were created to inherently execute this task . Over the years, new and more advanced networks have been developed, with the Autoencoder\n(AE) being one of the main types. Later, Olshausen et al. proposed the creation of\nsparse coding and Ng et al. introduced a sparse penalisation term in the hidden layer,\nto acquire more compact and effective features from lower-dimensional data. For some datasets with complex relationships between characteristics, employing more than one SAE\nis necessary, which is why stacked sparse autoencoders (SSAE) are commonly used .\nNowadays, these types of AE are widely used in various scientific fields, but specifically\nfor structural engineering only a few studies are found, and most are about damage detection on bridges [45–47].

However, the AE methods can also be combined with other techniques commonly used to classify the data.

The application of sensors on both sides of theTo obtain the responses from the railway track, it is necessary to apply sensors on the track that can measure the dynamic responses of the crossing trains. As it is not always possible\nto install them due to the high costs involved, simulations have been carried out based on calibrated models of the track , vehicle and considering their dynamic interaction,\nas well as including the track irregularities. Simulations include cases with healthy wheelsTo simulate the dynamic interactions between the vehicle and the track, an in-house software VSI – Vehicle-Structure Interaction Analysis is used, which was initially developed by\nNeves et al. and later improved by Montenegro et al. .

Including the track irregularities directly in the constraint equations are beneficial since it avoids explicitly considering\nthem in the FEM model. Moreover, it also allows to include the wheel and OOR profiles as a periodic rail irregularity, simplifying the analysis. Thus, before starting the analysis, the\nVSI software imports track irregularities and OOR profiles from a MATLAB file, whichto the vertical and lateral irregularities in each rail in each respective position, and adds it to the constraint equations of the system throughout the dynamics analysis. Then, the\nsystem of dynamic equations is solved using the typical Newmark integration method.\nThe impact of track irregularity on wheel defect classification is significant, as a lower track quality tends to result in a higher likelihood of misclassification. A comprehensive\nexploration of this influence was previously undertaken by Mosleh et al. as documented in their research study . Hence, this study does not delve into the impact of track\nquality; rather, it primarily centres on the utilisation of AI-based methodologies for the detection and classification of wheel defects. For this, four different profiles are used, based\non European Standard EN 13848–2 . In this case, power spectral density (PSD) curvesFor OOR defects, several profiles are defined based on real measurements in representative profiles of the various severities. Subsequently, the structural matrices are imported\nMore details on track and train properties, including additional information on traintrack interaction, can be found in previous publications . Figure 1 shows the\nvehicle–track interaction model schematisation and some details about the train and track\nsubsystems, as well as the track irregularities and wheel-rail contact model.According to the conclusions reached in other studies with this type of damage ,\nthe most promising location of the sensors is on the rail. To reduce installation and maintenance costs, it is important to reduce the number of sensors without compromising the\nquality of the results. Therefore, based on a sensitivity analysis performed during the study,\nonly two vertical unidirectional accelerometers were used on each rail, 4 in total (A1 to A4),\nsince they provided a higher cost–benefit ratio. These sensors are mounted on the rail atdefects, different simulation scenarios with perfect wheels (baseline) and OOR wheels\n(damage) were defined for a five-wagon Laagrss freight train. Based on different crossing speeds, loading schemes and rail irregularities profiles, 120 baseline and 180 damage scenarios (90 for polygonal wheels and 90 for wheel flats) were defined, as summarised in For baseline scenarios, six loading schemes with five different speeds (40, 60, 80, 100\nand 120 km/h) and four rail irregularity profiles were considered, giving a total of 120 scenarios. The loading schemes used are: empty, half-loaded, full-loaded and, additionally,For the damage cases, a total of 90 scenarios were generated for polygonal wheels. These\nscenarios including 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (H1, H2 and H3) x 10 different irregularity profiles within each specified harmonic interval. In these 10 irregularity\nprofiles, based on the defect amplitude, two amplitudes are considered, five simulations for\nA1 and five simulations for A2. Similarly, 90 scenarios were created for wheel flats, involving 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (F1, F2 and F3) x 10 different irregularitywheel radius . This wave phenomenon can be characterised by the different wavelengths formed (harmonics θ ), and by the levels of irregularity ( Lw ) associated with each of the harmonics.

Three experimental irregularity profiles were collected, illustrated in Figure 3. The first group (H6-8)\ncorresponds to a study carried out by Cai et al. with dominant harmonics from 6 to 8;**Figure 3.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) of polygonal wheels with**Figure 4.** Examples of polygonal damage profiles for each of the dominant harmonic intervals.the second group (H12-14) to a study authored by Tao et al. with dominant harmonics from 12 to 14; and the third profile (H17-18) to a study performed by Wu et al. with\nBased on the wheel irregularity spectra ( Lw ) taken from the respective measurement profiles, shown in Figure 3, and considering the contribution of the first 30 harmonics, several irregularity profiles were generated, according to Figure 4.

After obtaining the acceleration measurements from the numerical simulations, an FFT algorithm is applied to the time series allowing the conversion of the signal from the time domain to the frequency domain. Then,predefined hyperparameters of the algorithm. The set hyperparameters are encoding and\ndecoding transfer functions, hidden layer size, maximum number of epochs, L2 weight regularisation term, sparsity regularisation term and a sparsity proportion term. Afterwards,**Figure 7.** Flowchart with the main phases of the methodology for detection and classification of OORthe features are extracted in the more compressed layer of the SAE, the so-called bottleneck layer. The number of features obtained is equal to the number of hidden layers which\nis usually considerably lower than the data size, allowing a compression of the input data.\nFurthermore, to enhance the sensitivity to damage, two levels of data fusion are applied to the bottleneck features using the Mahalanobis distance. In the first level, all features are\nfused into a damage index (DI) for each sensor and, in the second level, all the sensors\nare merged resulting in only one DI for each simulation. Finally, automatic damage detection is achieved by performing an outlier analysis, in which a statistical confidence limit\n(CB) is used, based on the Inverse Cumulative Gaussian Distribution Function (ICDF).\nFor feature classification, an automatic clustering process based on the k-means technique is implemented. This algorithm allows for the unsupervised and automatic classification of data, based on the calculation of statistical distances between objects. In k-means technique given a vector of data and chosen k clusters, the key is to find k centroids that minimise\nthe distance of each vector to its nearest centroid . Since it is necessary to define the number of clusters in advance, a global Silhouette index (SIL) was adopted to make\nan automatic process. At the end, the clusters will allow the classification of the two typesbetween the number of correct classifications and the total number of cases.damage detection problems, as it allows a signal to be converted from the time domain to the frequency domain, to capture the excitation frequencies induced by the wheel defects.\nIn addition, a data reduction is carried out at this stage, since the initial records contain aa crossing speed of 80 km/h. When comparing the FFT spectra for a train passage with flats, Figure 8a), with polygonal wheels, Figure 8b), there are visible differences in terms\nof amplitude peak values and excited frequency ranges. For flats, the amplitude peak values are higher and they induce frequencies in the range between DC and 1500accordance with some authors reports . In terms of severities, for flats, the more severe group (55–100 mm) is the one with the higher frequency content, as expected,a baseline response. For polygonal wheels, from the analysis of Figure 8b), it can be seen the frequency peaks for the H12–14 and H17–18 profiles around 100 and 150\nrespectively, while for the profile H6-8 a more flat spectrum is obtained without showing any significant peak. This can be explained by the irregularity level profile of thisThese two graphs can show which frequencies have higher content in the original signal.Autoencoders are artificial neural networks trained using an unsupervised approach,\nwhich aim first to learn coded representations of the data, compressing the input into\na latent space representation, and second, through this compressed information, reconstructing the information. The basic architecture of this type of network consists of threewhere **Wij**, **Wjk** are the weights connection matrices between input layer-hidden\nlayer and hidden layer-output layer, **X** = ( **X** 1, **X** 2, . . ., **Xn** ) is the input data vector,\n**H** = ( **H** 1, . . ., **Hm** ) is the low-dimensional vector and **X** [ˆ] = ( **X** [ˆ] 1, **X** [ˆ] 2, . . ., **X** [ˆ] **n** ) is the output**Figure 8.** Frequency domain responses on position 1 for the crossing speed of 80 km/h: (a) wheel flats,data vector. **b** 1, **b** 2 are bias vectors and σ 1, σ 2 are the activation function used in each of thereconstruction of the input X [ˆ], as shown in Equation (3).

After incorporating various inputs into the SSAE training, they are integrated into the so-called\n‘Input 1’. As training progresses, the data is compressed, and the main characteristics of the signals are obtained and retained in ‘Bottleneck 1’. Subsequently, these characteristics are\nused as input for training the second sparse autoencoder, which, after further compression,\nenables the extraction of the final features. Depending on the type of data under analysis,\nthe compression level differs, so multiple tests should be conducted to optimise these layer sizes. This optimisation was achieved by trial and test, changing both the size of the first\nIt should be noted that this network architecture, where the dimensions of the layers gradually decrease along the network until reaching the bottleneck layer , has proven\nto be highly robust for the type of data used. It allows for effective compression of results**Figure 9.** Schematic of the structure of the SSAE neural network used in this study.After extracting the features from the bottleneck layer of the SSAE, the difference between the healthy wheels scenarios and the damage wheels scenarios is still not sufficient. Hence\na data fusion is performed. With this fusion, it is possible to increase the sensitivity of the\nfeatures, and as a result, to obtain a damage index (DI) for each simulation. Thus, the Mahalanobis distance (MD) is used to reduce the volume of extracted data and preserve the most relevant information . Briefly, MD is a metric that measures the distance between two points in a feature space consisting of two or more variables, being independent of the\nscale of the features, thus allowing an increase in the sensitivity of the features to cases with damage. The MD, denoted here as DI, is calculated for each simulation using the followingin which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−], and ¯ x is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The MD is calculated for each sensor and for each simulation, obtaining a matrix of n distances per k number of sensors.Finally, the discrimination of the features consists in distinguishing the features as corresponding to a healthy or damaged case. At this stage of the methodology, an analysis of\nabnormal values is carried out, which will allow the condition of the train wheels to beautomatically monitored and these values to be classified into different classes. This phaseThe outlier analysis consists of grouping, by probabilistic distribution processes, the datato the previously created group. For this, a statistical confidence limit (CB) is used, based on the inverse cumulative Gaussian distribution function (ICDF), considering the mean\nvalue, ¯ μ, and standard deviation, σ, of the baseline feature vector.Whenever a value of a DI indicator is equal to or greater than CB, it is considered an outlier (the null hypothesis is rejected), thus representing a case of damage.For feature classification, a clustering process is used to divide the dataset into distinct clusters that should be as compact and separated as possible . For clustering, the k-meanson the distances of their vectors. Recent studies showed that the k-means algorithm has shown promising results . The main limitation of this technique is that it requires\nknowledge of the number of clusters in advance. For this purpose, the global silhouetteThis section presents the main results obtained through the application of the methodology proposed in section 3 to the calculated track responses. The methodology is applied using damaged wheel passages for the three simulated train speeds (60, 80 and 100 km/h),hyperparameters (presented in section 3). By adjusting these hyperparameters, it is possible to make the algorithm more efficient and improve the generalisation capabilities, as only\nthe most important features are retained. The optimisation of these hyperparameters isof data under analysis. Based on the principles of the SAE already outlined in other works\nIn the context of this study, the non-linear transfer functions (logsig) proved to be more effective than the linear ones, being the ones used in all the studied cases. After analysing Table 3, there is a similarity in the hyperparameters when comparing the two types of OOR damage. It is observed that the data compression level is the same for both cases, around\n93%, as 500 features are extracted in Bottleneck 2 from the initial input data with 7000\nConcerning the type of damage situation, the size of the ‘Bottleneck 1’ and ‘Bottleneck\n2’ was increased to bring them even closer to the initial amount of input data. This can beanalysis, making it challenging for the autoencoder to define relationships between the data, hence requiring a larger number. On the contrary, the maximum number of epochsIt is also important to emphasise that of the various hyperparameters presented, theOnce the hyperparameters have been defined, all the steps of the methodology are applied to the new dataset. For simplicity, in this section, only the last phase of the methodology will be presented, namely an outlier analysis for damage detection and cluster analysis for damage classification. For each sensor, a matrix n × m is created, where n\nis the number of test passages (baseline scenarios + damage scenarios), and m represents the number of extracted features. So, the size of the matrices is 210 × 2000 in case of the\ntype of damage, 75 × 500 for each amplitude in polygonal wheel, and 120 × 500 for wheelDespite the visual distinction between healthy and damaged wheels based on the data processing presented in subsection 3.2, unsupervised learning must use strategies capable of automatically detecting damage. To this end, an outlier analysis is employed, which consists of defining a confidence threshold using a significance level of 1% , represented**Figure 10.** Automatic OOR damage detection based on outlier analysis.by the green line in Figure 10. This approach makes it possible to successfully detect allTo distinguish the two types of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed. Figure 11\nshows a clear distinction between the damage, even when using a dataset with three different train speeds (60,80 and 100 km/h).. In the case of Figure 11a), using all four\naccelerometers, it is possible to efficiently separate the set into two large clusters, despite\n30 misclassifications (16 in the polygonisation and 14 in the flats). Even so, the accuracy\npercentage is around 85%, which is a very good result. To analyse the sensitivity to the number of sensors, only two sensors were used, one on each side ). The results\nimproved, with a decrease in the number of misclassifications from 30 to 21 (13 for polygonisation and 8 for flats). One explanation could be the disparity in sensor sensitivity to the damage, where some sensors are more sensitive than others due to their spatial positioning in relation to the damage. By merging the data from the less sensitive sensors with the\nmore sensitive ones, this could have a negative impact on the results. Thus, the percentage\nThe purpose behind presenting these two plots was to demonstrate that, whether using 4 sensors or 2 sensors, the classification remains remarkably robust, showing lowAfter identifying the type of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed once again to\nclassify the severity of each damage separately. Regarding polygonal wheels, the classification involves both amplitude and harmonic orders, leading to the clusters depicted in the obtained clusters reasonably reflect the two amplitude groups, with all misclassifications associated with the H6-8 harmonic cases (17 misclassifications). Once the amplitude\nis identified, harmonic classification must be carried out separately for each of the amplitudes. In Figure 12b), related to amplitude A1, it is observed that the obtained clusters**Figure 11.** Automatic OOR damage classification based on cluster analysis using: a) 4 sensors; b) 2are nearly perfect, with only 3 misclassifications. In Figure 12c), there are only 3 misclassifications, totalling 8 misclassifications in the classification of the number of dominant\nThe classification of harmonic order is only possible with the separation of amplitudes,\nFigure 13 presents the clusters obtained for the wheel flat cases. The separation between\nthe less severe group and baseline cases and intermediate (cluster 3) and severe cases (cluster 4) is reduced, resulting in a total of 19 misclassifications. Nevertheless, this result showsrate of about 84%. One possible reason for this significant number of misclassifications could be directly associated with the number of impacts captured by the sensor.In order to contribute to the safety of railway transportation and service quality, an automatic methodology based on machine learning has been proposed. This methodology can accurately detect and classify two types of OOR wheel damage in railway vehicles allowing to mitigate problems at both track and vehicle level, such as derailments or material\ndegradation. It includes a new technique for feature extraction based on a dedicated neural network, the Sparse Autoencoder. This non-linear technique is an upgrade concerning the commonly used linear techniques for feature extraction since it allows a better normalisation of the operational effects in the analysed data, as well as the reduction of large amounts\nof data without relying on other techniques, while keeping the most valuable information. These improvements are achieved through the use of different hyperparameters in**Figure 12.** Automatic classification of polygonal wheels based on cluster analysis: a) amplitude A1-A2;**Figure 13.** Automatic classification of wheel flats based on cluster analysis.the calculations, such as non-linear activation functions and sparsity terms. Consequently,circulation. Particularly in the railway engineering field, the inclusion of this technique\nshowed a good potential to deal with variable train speeds, essentially due to the amplifying effect on the measured track dynamic responses which could induce errors in damage The application of the methodology to the data set proved to be very successful in detecting and classifying the two types of OOR damages. Damage detection was perfect, without\nany false detection. In terms of classifying the type of damage, the results are very good,\nwith a success rate of around 85%, but if only two accelerometers are considered the successrate increases to around 90%. These results are encouraging since the range of speeds considered in the analysis, between 60 and 100 km/h, is the most representative of in-service\nfreight trains. Also, the results show that including the Sparse Autoencoder has a positive\neffect in the normalization of the train speed in the damage data set.\nRegarding the severity classification for each type of damage, the methodology proved equally successful in clustering the different damage severities. For polygonal wheels, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the severity groups in terms of defect amplitude, failing only for the H6-8 harmonic cases, and in terms of harmonic orders for each amplitude,\nwith almost perfect results. For wheel flats, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the three severity groups, though with some misclassifications between the less severe group\nand baseline cases and between intermediate and severe cases. A success rate of around 86%\nis achieved in the classification of polygonal wheel severities and 84% in the classification of wheel flat severities. Even so, these high success rates of over 80% show the robustness\nof this methodology in damage classification regardless of the train speed.on on-site measurements. Additionally, this methodology could be carried out for other types of railway vehicles, for example, passenger vehicles, since the dynamic responses are\ndifferent from freight vehicles. In that case, exploring other recent types of autoencoders,\nTo increase the complexity of the problem, the objective is to explore the concept of\nmultiple damages (same or different OOR types). For this, it will be necessary to incorporate a new stage in the methodology, the damage location stage, which will make it possible\nto distinguish isolated damage from multiple damage, as well as their respective location.\nThus, damage will be identified using cut signals, which will then be used to classify theThis work is a result of project WAY4SafeRail-WAYside monitoring system FOR SAFE RAIL transportation, with reference NORTE-01-0247-FEDER-069595, co-funded by the European Regional\nDevelopment Fund (ERDF), through the North Portugal Regional Operational Programme\nPartnership Agreement.

However, this type of system entail high costs envisaging the vehicle wheel condition monitoring, since sensors need to be installed in every vehicle in order to achieve a good representativity . On the other hand, wayside systems are a more viable solution for identifying wheel defects, since the condition of allThe most common wheel defects are known as OOR. As the name infers, this defect is related to deformations on the surface of the wheel circumference that make it not round.\nThis deformation can have many forms and different causes, leading to faults on the vehicle and on the track due to the higher dynamic force values [4–6]. The OOR damagesa function of their shape and size, vehicle characteristics and speed [7–10]. Wheel flats induce high dynamic impact loads on the railway infrastructure, which causes significant damage to both tracks and vehicles, such as broken axles, damaged rolling bearings and cracks in the wheels, rails and sleepers . Moreover, it also generates high vibrations\ntransmitted to the rolling stock, inducing significant stresses and causing damage to the In the case of polygonal wheels, the formation mechanism can be roughly classified\ninto three categories, namely, (1) initial wheel defects , (2) a natural vibration of the\nvehicle–track system and (3) thermoelastic instability . The formation mechanism is strongly contingent on the vehicle type and its operational characteristics, withof dominant harmonic orders [19–22]. For example, Tao et al. studied asymmetrical polygonal wear on metro wheels and obtained harmonic orders of 12–14, while another study by Tao et al. found that the most common harmonic order in Chinese freight trains is 18–19. Although a polygonal wheel could generate less impact on the track than a\nwheel flat, this defect can cause serious damage to the track due to resonance effects in the\nTo identify the occurrence of these OOR anomalies in train wheels, innovative\nmethodologies have been developed combining signal processing and automatic learning techniques. These methodologies are based on the extraction of damage sensitivity features, making possible the distinction between undamaged and damaged situations. Recently, many studies have shown good results in detecting OOR damages using\ndistinct approaches [24–29]. Mishra et al. concluded that a single FBG (Fiber Bragg Grating) sensor, positioned along the rail can detect the presence of wheel flats.\nLourenço et al. created an automatic algorithm for diagnosing OOR defects. The\nproposed methodology consists of isolating specific defective wheels and then identifying the severity of the damage, using only acceleration and strain data measured on\nthe track. In another study, Krummenacher et al. , proposed two machine-learningBy extracting the features, it is possible to transform the measured data into an alternative form of information where the correlation with damage is more easily observed. There are various techniques for feature extraction, the most common being CWT\n(continuous wavelet transform) [31–33], PCA (principal component analysis) ,detection of polygonal wheels on freight vehicles using CWT and ARX features, using\n6 accelerometers, 3 on each side of the railway track. Mosleh et al. introduced aflats by extracting AR features from acceleration records. Moreover, Mohammadi et al.\nadopted linear features, particularly, CWT, PCA, ARX and AR, and their research findingsin the context of wheel flat damage detection. Although these studies have demonstrated robust results in detection, they show some limitations in dealing with the non-linear effects associated with operational effects, such as the train speed. Due to the inability of these linear techniques to attenuate operation effects, the inclusion of different speeds\nFor most of these studies, a feature normalisation stage is used when it is necessary to remove the operational effects. Usually, latent variable methods are used, such as PCA or multiple linear regression (MLR) . Thus, to deal with the non-linear phenomena and reduce the large amounts of data without relying on the aforementioned methods,\nthe first artificial neural networks were created to inherently execute this task . Over the years, new and more advanced networks have been developed, with the Autoencoder\n(AE) being one of the main types. Later, Olshausen et al. proposed the creation of\nsparse coding and Ng et al. introduced a sparse penalisation term in the hidden layer,\nto acquire more compact and effective features from lower-dimensional data. For some datasets with complex relationships between characteristics, employing more than one SAE\nis necessary, which is why stacked sparse autoencoders (SSAE) are commonly used .\nNowadays, these types of AE are widely used in various scientific fields, but specifically\nfor structural engineering only a few studies are found, and most are about damage detection on bridges [45–47].

Pathirage et al. proposed a framework utilizing SAE’s potential for dimensionality reduction, which facilitated the assessment of damage detection performance on Many of these AE algorithms already performed feature classification in order to discriminate the different types of damages and severities. However, the AE methods can also be combined with other techniques commonly used to classify the data. They can be used unsupervised methods, in which the model is trained without any labels provided to the\ntraining dataset, such as k-means , self-organising maps (SOM) , isolation forest, gaussian mixture model , k-medoids and cluster analysis , or supervised\nmethods, which assume that the hierarchy of database categories is known, such as NaiveBayes classifiers , k-Nearest Neighbours classifiers , Support Vector Machinetwo types of OOR damages, flats and polygonal wheels, based on acceleration responses obtained from a virtual wayside monitoring system.

The application of sensors on both sides of theTo obtain the responses from the railway track, it is necessary to apply sensors on the track that can measure the dynamic responses of the crossing trains. As it is not always possible\nto install them due to the high costs involved, simulations have been carried out based on calibrated models of the track , vehicle and considering their dynamic interaction,\nas well as including the track irregularities. Simulations include cases with healthy wheelsTo simulate the dynamic interactions between the vehicle and the track, an in-house software VSI – Vehicle-Structure Interaction Analysis is used, which was initially developed by\nNeves et al. and later improved by Montenegro et al. .

Including the track irregularities directly in the constraint equations are beneficial since it avoids explicitly considering\nthem in the FEM model. Moreover, it also allows to include the wheel and OOR profiles as a periodic rail irregularity, simplifying the analysis. Thus, before starting the analysis, the\nVSI software imports track irregularities and OOR profiles from a MATLAB file, whichto the vertical and lateral irregularities in each rail in each respective position, and adds it to the constraint equations of the system throughout the dynamics analysis. Then, the\nsystem of dynamic equations is solved using the typical Newmark integration method.\nThe impact of track irregularity on wheel defect classification is significant, as a lower track quality tends to result in a higher likelihood of misclassification. A comprehensive\nexploration of this influence was previously undertaken by Mosleh et al. as documented in their research study . Hence, this study does not delve into the impact of track\nquality; rather, it primarily centres on the utilisation of AI-based methodologies for the detection and classification of wheel defects. For this, four different profiles are used, based\non European Standard EN 13848–2 . In this case, power spectral density (PSD) curvesFor OOR defects, several profiles are defined based on real measurements in representative profiles of the various severities. Subsequently, the structural matrices are imported\nMore details on track and train properties, including additional information on traintrack interaction, can be found in previous publications . Figure 1 shows the\nvehicle–track interaction model schematisation and some details about the train and track\nsubsystems, as well as the track irregularities and wheel-rail contact model.According to the conclusions reached in other studies with this type of damage ,\nthe most promising location of the sensors is on the rail. To reduce installation and maintenance costs, it is important to reduce the number of sensors without compromising the\nquality of the results. Therefore, based on a sensitivity analysis performed during the study,\nonly two vertical unidirectional accelerometers were used on each rail, 4 in total (A1 to A4),\nsince they provided a higher cost–benefit ratio. These sensors are mounted on the rail atdefects, different simulation scenarios with perfect wheels (baseline) and OOR wheels\n(damage) were defined for a five-wagon Laagrss freight train. Based on different crossing speeds, loading schemes and rail irregularities profiles, 120 baseline and 180 damage scenarios (90 for polygonal wheels and 90 for wheel flats) were defined, as summarised in For baseline scenarios, six loading schemes with five different speeds (40, 60, 80, 100\nand 120 km/h) and four rail irregularity profiles were considered, giving a total of 120 scenarios. The loading schemes used are: empty, half-loaded, full-loaded and, additionally,For the damage cases, a total of 90 scenarios were generated for polygonal wheels. These\nscenarios including 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (H1, H2 and H3) x 10 different irregularity profiles within each specified harmonic interval. In these 10 irregularity\nprofiles, based on the defect amplitude, two amplitudes are considered, five simulations for\nA1 and five simulations for A2. Similarly, 90 scenarios were created for wheel flats, involving 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (F1, F2 and F3) x 10 different irregularitywheel radius . This wave phenomenon can be characterised by the different wavelengths formed (harmonics θ ), and by the levels of irregularity ( Lw ) associated with each of the harmonics. According to Peng , it is considered a polygonal wheel when the wear amplitude assumes values above 0. mm and wavelengths between 140 mm and the wheelTo define scenarios with polygonal wheels for the Laagrss wagon, a literature survey on\nexperimental measurements in defective wheels was conducted . Three experimental irregularity profiles were collected, illustrated in Figure 3. The first group (H6-8)\ncorresponds to a study carried out by Cai et al. with dominant harmonics from 6 to 8;**Figure 3.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) of polygonal wheels with**Figure 4.** Examples of polygonal damage profiles for each of the dominant harmonic intervals.the second group (H12-14) to a study authored by Tao et al. with dominant harmonics from 12 to 14; and the third profile (H17-18) to a study performed by Wu et al. with\nBased on the wheel irregularity spectra ( Lw ) taken from the respective measurement profiles, shown in Figure 3, and considering the contribution of the first 30 harmonics, several irregularity profiles were generated, according to Figure 4.

Then,predefined hyperparameters of the algorithm. The set hyperparameters are encoding and\ndecoding transfer functions, hidden layer size, maximum number of epochs, L2 weight regularisation term, sparsity regularisation term and a sparsity proportion term. Afterwards,**Figure 7.** Flowchart with the main phases of the methodology for detection and classification of OORthe features are extracted in the more compressed layer of the SAE, the so-called bottleneck layer. The number of features obtained is equal to the number of hidden layers which\nis usually considerably lower than the data size, allowing a compression of the input data.\nFurthermore, to enhance the sensitivity to damage, two levels of data fusion are applied to the bottleneck features using the Mahalanobis distance. In the first level, all features are\nfused into a damage index (DI) for each sensor and, in the second level, all the sensors\nare merged resulting in only one DI for each simulation. Finally, automatic damage detection is achieved by performing an outlier analysis, in which a statistical confidence limit\n(CB) is used, based on the Inverse Cumulative Gaussian Distribution Function (ICDF).\nFor feature classification, an automatic clustering process based on the k-means technique is implemented. This algorithm allows for the unsupervised and automatic classification of data, based on the calculation of statistical distances between objects. In k-means technique given a vector of data and chosen k clusters, the key is to find k centroids that minimise\nthe distance of each vector to its nearest centroid . Since it is necessary to define the number of clusters in advance, a global Silhouette index (SIL) was adopted to make\nan automatic process. At the end, the clusters will allow the classification of the two typesbetween the number of correct classifications and the total number of cases.damage detection problems, as it allows a signal to be converted from the time domain to the frequency domain, to capture the excitation frequencies induced by the wheel defects.\nIn addition, a data reduction is carried out at this stage, since the initial records contain aa crossing speed of 80 km/h. When comparing the FFT spectra for a train passage with flats, Figure 8a), with polygonal wheels, Figure 8b), there are visible differences in terms\nof amplitude peak values and excited frequency ranges. For flats, the amplitude peak values are higher and they induce frequencies in the range between DC and 1500accordance with some authors reports . In terms of severities, for flats, the more severe group (55–100 mm) is the one with the higher frequency content, as expected,a baseline response. For polygonal wheels, from the analysis of Figure 8b), it can be seen the frequency peaks for the H12–14 and H17–18 profiles around 100 and 150\nrespectively, while for the profile H6-8 a more flat spectrum is obtained without showing any significant peak. This can be explained by the irregularity level profile of thisThese two graphs can show which frequencies have higher content in the original signal.Autoencoders are artificial neural networks trained using an unsupervised approach,\nwhich aim first to learn coded representations of the data, compressing the input into\na latent space representation, and second, through this compressed information, reconstructing the information. The basic architecture of this type of network consists of threewhere **Wij**, **Wjk** are the weights connection matrices between input layer-hidden\nlayer and hidden layer-output layer, **X** = ( **X** 1, **X** 2, . . ., **Xn** ) is the input data vector,\n**H** = ( **H** 1, . . ., **Hm** ) is the low-dimensional vector and **X** [ˆ] = ( **X** [ˆ] 1, **X** [ˆ] 2, . . ., **X** [ˆ] **n** ) is the output**Figure 8.** Frequency domain responses on position 1 for the crossing speed of 80 km/h: (a) wheel flats,data vector. **b** 1, **b** 2 are bias vectors and σ 1, σ 2 are the activation function used in each of thereconstruction of the input X [ˆ], as shown in Equation (3).

After incorporating various inputs into the SSAE training, they are integrated into the so-called\n‘Input 1’. As training progresses, the data is compressed, and the main characteristics of the signals are obtained and retained in ‘Bottleneck 1’. Subsequently, these characteristics are\nused as input for training the second sparse autoencoder, which, after further compression,\nenables the extraction of the final features. Depending on the type of data under analysis,\nthe compression level differs, so multiple tests should be conducted to optimise these layer sizes. This optimisation was achieved by trial and test, changing both the size of the first\nIt should be noted that this network architecture, where the dimensions of the layers gradually decrease along the network until reaching the bottleneck layer , has proven\nto be highly robust for the type of data used. It allows for effective compression of results**Figure 9.** Schematic of the structure of the SSAE neural network used in this study.After extracting the features from the bottleneck layer of the SSAE, the difference between the healthy wheels scenarios and the damage wheels scenarios is still not sufficient. Hence\na data fusion is performed. With this fusion, it is possible to increase the sensitivity of the\nfeatures, and as a result, to obtain a damage index (DI) for each simulation. Thus, the Mahalanobis distance (MD) is used to reduce the volume of extracted data and preserve the most relevant information . Briefly, MD is a metric that measures the distance between two points in a feature space consisting of two or more variables, being independent of the\nscale of the features, thus allowing an increase in the sensitivity of the features to cases with damage. The MD, denoted here as DI, is calculated for each simulation using the followingin which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−], and ¯ x is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The MD is calculated for each sensor and for each simulation, obtaining a matrix of n distances per k number of sensors.Finally, the discrimination of the features consists in distinguishing the features as corresponding to a healthy or damaged case. At this stage of the methodology, an analysis of\nabnormal values is carried out, which will allow the condition of the train wheels to beautomatically monitored and these values to be classified into different classes. This phaseThe outlier analysis consists of grouping, by probabilistic distribution processes, the datato the previously created group. For this, a statistical confidence limit (CB) is used, based on the inverse cumulative Gaussian distribution function (ICDF), considering the mean\nvalue, ¯ μ, and standard deviation, σ, of the baseline feature vector.Whenever a value of a DI indicator is equal to or greater than CB, it is considered an outlier (the null hypothesis is rejected), thus representing a case of damage.For feature classification, a clustering process is used to divide the dataset into distinct clusters that should be as compact and separated as possible . For clustering, the k-meanson the distances of their vectors. Recent studies showed that the k-means algorithm has shown promising results . The main limitation of this technique is that it requires\nknowledge of the number of clusters in advance. For this purpose, the global silhouetteThis section presents the main results obtained through the application of the methodology proposed in section 3 to the calculated track responses. The methodology is applied using damaged wheel passages for the three simulated train speeds (60, 80 and 100 km/h),hyperparameters (presented in section 3). By adjusting these hyperparameters, it is possible to make the algorithm more efficient and improve the generalisation capabilities, as only\nthe most important features are retained. The optimisation of these hyperparameters isof data under analysis. Based on the principles of the SAE already outlined in other works\nIn the context of this study, the non-linear transfer functions (logsig) proved to be more effective than the linear ones, being the ones used in all the studied cases. After analysing Table 3, there is a similarity in the hyperparameters when comparing the two types of OOR damage. It is observed that the data compression level is the same for both cases, around\n93%, as 500 features are extracted in Bottleneck 2 from the initial input data with 7000\nConcerning the type of damage situation, the size of the ‘Bottleneck 1’ and ‘Bottleneck\n2’ was increased to bring them even closer to the initial amount of input data. This can beanalysis, making it challenging for the autoencoder to define relationships between the data, hence requiring a larger number. On the contrary, the maximum number of epochsIt is also important to emphasise that of the various hyperparameters presented, theOnce the hyperparameters have been defined, all the steps of the methodology are applied to the new dataset. For simplicity, in this section, only the last phase of the methodology will be presented, namely an outlier analysis for damage detection and cluster analysis for damage classification. For each sensor, a matrix n × m is created, where n\nis the number of test passages (baseline scenarios + damage scenarios), and m represents the number of extracted features. So, the size of the matrices is 210 × 2000 in case of the\ntype of damage, 75 × 500 for each amplitude in polygonal wheel, and 120 × 500 for wheelDespite the visual distinction between healthy and damaged wheels based on the data processing presented in subsection 3.2, unsupervised learning must use strategies capable of automatically detecting damage. To this end, an outlier analysis is employed, which consists of defining a confidence threshold using a significance level of 1% , represented**Figure 10.** Automatic OOR damage detection based on outlier analysis.by the green line in Figure 10. This approach makes it possible to successfully detect allTo distinguish the two types of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed. Figure 11\nshows a clear distinction between the damage, even when using a dataset with three different train speeds (60,80 and 100 km/h).. In the case of Figure 11a), using all four\naccelerometers, it is possible to efficiently separate the set into two large clusters, despite\n30 misclassifications (16 in the polygonisation and 14 in the flats). Even so, the accuracy\npercentage is around 85%, which is a very good result. To analyse the sensitivity to the number of sensors, only two sensors were used, one on each side ). The results\nimproved, with a decrease in the number of misclassifications from 30 to 21 (13 for polygonisation and 8 for flats). One explanation could be the disparity in sensor sensitivity to the damage, where some sensors are more sensitive than others due to their spatial positioning in relation to the damage. By merging the data from the less sensitive sensors with the\nmore sensitive ones, this could have a negative impact on the results. Thus, the percentage\nThe purpose behind presenting these two plots was to demonstrate that, whether using 4 sensors or 2 sensors, the classification remains remarkably robust, showing lowAfter identifying the type of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed once again to\nclassify the severity of each damage separately. Regarding polygonal wheels, the classification involves both amplitude and harmonic orders, leading to the clusters depicted in the obtained clusters reasonably reflect the two amplitude groups, with all misclassifications associated with the H6-8 harmonic cases (17 misclassifications). Once the amplitude\nis identified, harmonic classification must be carried out separately for each of the amplitudes. In Figure 12b), related to amplitude A1, it is observed that the obtained clusters**Figure 11.** Automatic OOR damage classification based on cluster analysis using: a) 4 sensors; b) 2are nearly perfect, with only 3 misclassifications. In Figure 12c), there are only 3 misclassifications, totalling 8 misclassifications in the classification of the number of dominant\nThe classification of harmonic order is only possible with the separation of amplitudes,\nFigure 13 presents the clusters obtained for the wheel flat cases. The separation between\nthe less severe group and baseline cases and intermediate (cluster 3) and severe cases (cluster 4) is reduced, resulting in a total of 19 misclassifications. Nevertheless, this result showsrate of about 84%. One possible reason for this significant number of misclassifications could be directly associated with the number of impacts captured by the sensor.In order to contribute to the safety of railway transportation and service quality, an automatic methodology based on machine learning has been proposed. This methodology can accurately detect and classify two types of OOR wheel damage in railway vehicles allowing to mitigate problems at both track and vehicle level, such as derailments or material\ndegradation. It includes a new technique for feature extraction based on a dedicated neural network, the Sparse Autoencoder. This non-linear technique is an upgrade concerning the commonly used linear techniques for feature extraction since it allows a better normalisation of the operational effects in the analysed data, as well as the reduction of large amounts\nof data without relying on other techniques, while keeping the most valuable information. These improvements are achieved through the use of different hyperparameters in**Figure 12.** Automatic classification of polygonal wheels based on cluster analysis: a) amplitude A1-A2;**Figure 13.** Automatic classification of wheel flats based on cluster analysis.the calculations, such as non-linear activation functions and sparsity terms. Consequently,circulation. Particularly in the railway engineering field, the inclusion of this technique\nshowed a good potential to deal with variable train speeds, essentially due to the amplifying effect on the measured track dynamic responses which could induce errors in damage The application of the methodology to the data set proved to be very successful in detecting and classifying the two types of OOR damages. Damage detection was perfect, without\nany false detection. In terms of classifying the type of damage, the results are very good,\nwith a success rate of around 85%, but if only two accelerometers are considered the successrate increases to around 90%. These results are encouraging since the range of speeds considered in the analysis, between 60 and 100 km/h, is the most representative of in-service\nfreight trains. Also, the results show that including the Sparse Autoencoder has a positive\neffect in the normalization of the train speed in the damage data set.\nRegarding the severity classification for each type of damage, the methodology proved equally successful in clustering the different damage severities. For polygonal wheels, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the severity groups in terms of defect amplitude, failing only for the H6-8 harmonic cases, and in terms of harmonic orders for each amplitude,\nwith almost perfect results. For wheel flats, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the three severity groups, though with some misclassifications between the less severe group\nand baseline cases and between intermediate and severe cases. A success rate of around 86%\nis achieved in the classification of polygonal wheel severities and 84% in the classification of wheel flat severities. Even so, these high success rates of over 80% show the robustness\nof this methodology in damage classification regardless of the train speed.on on-site measurements. Additionally, this methodology could be carried out for other types of railway vehicles, for example, passenger vehicles, since the dynamic responses are\ndifferent from freight vehicles. In that case, exploring other recent types of autoencoders,\nTo increase the complexity of the problem, the objective is to explore the concept of\nmultiple damages (same or different OOR types). For this, it will be necessary to incorporate a new stage in the methodology, the damage location stage, which will make it possible\nto distinguish isolated damage from multiple damage, as well as their respective location.\nThus, damage will be identified using cut signals, which will then be used to classify theThis work is a result of project WAY4SafeRail-WAYside monitoring system FOR SAFE RAIL transportation, with reference NORTE-01-0247-FEDER-069595, co-funded by the European Regional\nDevelopment Fund (ERDF), through the North Portugal Regional Operational Programme\nPartnership Agreement.

Within this context,\nan unsupervised methodology based on artificial intelligence techniques is presented, which allows the detection and classification of wheels, based on dynamic responses induced on the track by crossing freight railway vehicles. The methodology involves the following\nsteps: (i) data collection and pre-processing, (ii) feature extraction (iii)\ndata fusion and (iv) feature discrimination. In the first phase, an FFT\nalgorithm is applied to the acceleration track responses. Then, features are extracted after training a Stacked Sparse Autoencoder, in which the main features of the responses are obtained after a compression stage using an encoder network. This lower dimensional\nlayer forces the model to learn a compression of the input data. Then,\nwhich enhances the sensitivity to the damage recognition. Posteriorly, an outlier analysis is performed to distinguish a healthy wheelRail vehicle wheels are subjected to constant wear and tear due to continuous use and inadequate maintenance plans. Over time, this wear and tear can generate more significant defects, so it is extremely important to use sensing to understand when maintenance of both the track and rolling stock is required.

However, this type of system entail high costs envisaging the vehicle wheel condition monitoring, since sensors need to be installed in every vehicle in order to achieve a good representativity . On the other hand, wayside systems are a more viable solution for identifying wheel defects, since the condition of allThe most common wheel defects are known as OOR. As the name infers, this defect is related to deformations on the surface of the wheel circumference that make it not round.\nThis deformation can have many forms and different causes, leading to faults on the vehicle and on the track due to the higher dynamic force values [4–6]. The OOR damagesa function of their shape and size, vehicle characteristics and speed [7–10]. Wheel flats induce high dynamic impact loads on the railway infrastructure, which causes significant damage to both tracks and vehicles, such as broken axles, damaged rolling bearings and cracks in the wheels, rails and sleepers . Moreover, it also generates high vibrations\ntransmitted to the rolling stock, inducing significant stresses and causing damage to the In the case of polygonal wheels, the formation mechanism can be roughly classified\ninto three categories, namely, (1) initial wheel defects , (2) a natural vibration of the\nvehicle–track system and (3) thermoelastic instability . The formation mechanism is strongly contingent on the vehicle type and its operational characteristics, withof dominant harmonic orders [19–22]. For example, Tao et al. studied asymmetrical polygonal wear on metro wheels and obtained harmonic orders of 12–14, while another study by Tao et al. found that the most common harmonic order in Chinese freight trains is 18–19. Although a polygonal wheel could generate less impact on the track than a\nwheel flat, this defect can cause serious damage to the track due to resonance effects in the\nTo identify the occurrence of these OOR anomalies in train wheels, innovative\nmethodologies have been developed combining signal processing and automatic learning techniques. These methodologies are based on the extraction of damage sensitivity features, making possible the distinction between undamaged and damaged situations. Recently, many studies have shown good results in detecting OOR damages using\ndistinct approaches [24–29]. Mishra et al. concluded that a single FBG (Fiber Bragg Grating) sensor, positioned along the rail can detect the presence of wheel flats.\nLourenço et al. created an automatic algorithm for diagnosing OOR defects. The\nproposed methodology consists of isolating specific defective wheels and then identifying the severity of the damage, using only acceleration and strain data measured on\nthe track. In another study, Krummenacher et al. , proposed two machine-learningBy extracting the features, it is possible to transform the measured data into an alternative form of information where the correlation with damage is more easily observed. There are various techniques for feature extraction, the most common being CWT\n(continuous wavelet transform) [31–33], PCA (principal component analysis) ,detection of polygonal wheels on freight vehicles using CWT and ARX features, using\n6 accelerometers, 3 on each side of the railway track. Mosleh et al. introduced aflats by extracting AR features from acceleration records. Moreover, Mohammadi et al.\nadopted linear features, particularly, CWT, PCA, ARX and AR, and their research findingsin the context of wheel flat damage detection. Although these studies have demonstrated robust results in detection, they show some limitations in dealing with the non-linear effects associated with operational effects, such as the train speed. Due to the inability of these linear techniques to attenuate operation effects, the inclusion of different speeds\nFor most of these studies, a feature normalisation stage is used when it is necessary to remove the operational effects. Usually, latent variable methods are used, such as PCA or multiple linear regression (MLR) . Thus, to deal with the non-linear phenomena and reduce the large amounts of data without relying on the aforementioned methods,\nthe first artificial neural networks were created to inherently execute this task . Over the years, new and more advanced networks have been developed, with the Autoencoder\n(AE) being one of the main types. Later, Olshausen et al. proposed the creation of\nsparse coding and Ng et al. introduced a sparse penalisation term in the hidden layer,\nto acquire more compact and effective features from lower-dimensional data. For some datasets with complex relationships between characteristics, employing more than one SAE\nis necessary, which is why stacked sparse autoencoders (SSAE) are commonly used .\nNowadays, these types of AE are widely used in various scientific fields, but specifically\nfor structural engineering only a few studies are found, and most are about damage detection on bridges [45–47]. Amaral et al. , proposed an approach for detecting structural anomalies based on SAE and Shewhart’s T control chart. The characteristics extracted byin structures. In another similar study, Amaral et al. , applied the same approach to\na numerical model of a highway viaduct in Brazil reaching more than 99% of successful classifications of structural damage with the combination of SAE and Support Vector Machine. Pathirage et al. proposed a framework utilizing SAE’s potential for dimensionality reduction, which facilitated the assessment of damage detection performance on Many of these AE algorithms already performed feature classification in order to discriminate the different types of damages and severities. However, the AE methods can also be combined with other techniques commonly used to classify the data. They can be used unsupervised methods, in which the model is trained without any labels provided to the\ntraining dataset, such as k-means , self-organising maps (SOM) , isolation forest, gaussian mixture model , k-medoids and cluster analysis , or supervised\nmethods, which assume that the hierarchy of database categories is known, such as NaiveBayes classifiers , k-Nearest Neighbours classifiers , Support Vector Machinetwo types of OOR damages, flats and polygonal wheels, based on acceleration responses obtained from a virtual wayside monitoring system.

The application of sensors on both sides of theTo obtain the responses from the railway track, it is necessary to apply sensors on the track that can measure the dynamic responses of the crossing trains. As it is not always possible\nto install them due to the high costs involved, simulations have been carried out based on calibrated models of the track , vehicle and considering their dynamic interaction,\nas well as including the track irregularities. Simulations include cases with healthy wheelsTo simulate the dynamic interactions between the vehicle and the track, an in-house software VSI – Vehicle-Structure Interaction Analysis is used, which was initially developed by\nNeves et al. and later improved by Montenegro et al. .

The vehicle model integrates spring elements to simulate suspensions, mass elements to represent the mass and\ninertia at the centre of gravity of the wagon components. For the structural connection of these elements, rigid beam elements are adopted. Table 1 outlines the properties of the The Hertzian theory is applied to calculate the normal contact forces, while the USETABthe train to the track in the VSI software. Using Lagrange multipliers, this tool connects\nwheel displacements with the track nodal displacements, incorporating track irregularities and OOR profiles through a set of constraint equations. These equations are solved\nalongside equilibrium equations, forming a unified system that couples the two subsystems\n. Including the track irregularities directly in the constraint equations are beneficial since it avoids explicitly considering\nthem in the FEM model. Moreover, it also allows to include the wheel and OOR profiles as a periodic rail irregularity, simplifying the analysis. Thus, before starting the analysis, the\nVSI software imports track irregularities and OOR profiles from a MATLAB file, whichto the vertical and lateral irregularities in each rail in each respective position, and adds it to the constraint equations of the system throughout the dynamics analysis. Then, the\nsystem of dynamic equations is solved using the typical Newmark integration method.\nThe impact of track irregularity on wheel defect classification is significant, as a lower track quality tends to result in a higher likelihood of misclassification. A comprehensive\nexploration of this influence was previously undertaken by Mosleh et al. as documented in their research study . Hence, this study does not delve into the impact of track\nquality; rather, it primarily centres on the utilisation of AI-based methodologies for the detection and classification of wheel defects. For this, four different profiles are used, based\non European Standard EN 13848–2 . In this case, power spectral density (PSD) curvesFor OOR defects, several profiles are defined based on real measurements in representative profiles of the various severities. Subsequently, the structural matrices are imported\nMore details on track and train properties, including additional information on traintrack interaction, can be found in previous publications . Figure 1 shows the\nvehicle–track interaction model schematisation and some details about the train and track\nsubsystems, as well as the track irregularities and wheel-rail contact model.According to the conclusions reached in other studies with this type of damage ,\nthe most promising location of the sensors is on the rail. To reduce installation and maintenance costs, it is important to reduce the number of sensors without compromising the\nquality of the results. Therefore, based on a sensitivity analysis performed during the study,\nonly two vertical unidirectional accelerometers were used on each rail, 4 in total (A1 to A4),\nsince they provided a higher cost–benefit ratio. These sensors are mounted on the rail atdefects, different simulation scenarios with perfect wheels (baseline) and OOR wheels\n(damage) were defined for a five-wagon Laagrss freight train. Based on different crossing speeds, loading schemes and rail irregularities profiles, 120 baseline and 180 damage scenarios (90 for polygonal wheels and 90 for wheel flats) were defined, as summarised in For baseline scenarios, six loading schemes with five different speeds (40, 60, 80, 100\nand 120 km/h) and four rail irregularity profiles were considered, giving a total of 120 scenarios. The loading schemes used are: empty, half-loaded, full-loaded and, additionally,For the damage cases, a total of 90 scenarios were generated for polygonal wheels. These\nscenarios including 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (H1, H2 and H3) x 10 different irregularity profiles within each specified harmonic interval. In these 10 irregularity\nprofiles, based on the defect amplitude, two amplitudes are considered, five simulations for\nA1 and five simulations for A2. Similarly, 90 scenarios were created for wheel flats, involving 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (F1, F2 and F3) x 10 different irregularitywheel radius . This wave phenomenon can be characterised by the different wavelengths formed (harmonics θ ), and by the levels of irregularity ( Lw ) associated with each of the harmonics. According to Peng , it is considered a polygonal wheel when the wear amplitude assumes values above 0. mm and wavelengths between 140 mm and the wheelTo define scenarios with polygonal wheels for the Laagrss wagon, a literature survey on\nexperimental measurements in defective wheels was conducted . Three experimental irregularity profiles were collected, illustrated in Figure 3. The first group (H6-8)\ncorresponds to a study carried out by Cai et al. with dominant harmonics from 6 to 8;**Figure 3.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) of polygonal wheels with**Figure 4.** Examples of polygonal damage profiles for each of the dominant harmonic intervals.the second group (H12-14) to a study authored by Tao et al. with dominant harmonics from 12 to 14; and the third profile (H17-18) to a study performed by Wu et al. with\nBased on the wheel irregularity spectra ( Lw ) taken from the respective measurement profiles, shown in Figure 3, and considering the contribution of the first 30 harmonics, several irregularity profiles were generated, according to Figure 4.

A less severe group, with a 10–20 mm length, an intermediate group, with a 25–50 mm length and a more severe case, with a 55–100 mm length. The irregularity profiles are generated randomly, but in this case, in function of two geometric\nvariables, the length and the depth of the flat. More details about the process of generation of flat profiles can be found in the study performed by Mosleh et al .

The sampling frequency for data acquisition is considered 10 kHz in order to ensure a good problem Figure 6a) shows two baseline cases for two speeds (40 and 100 km/h), where it is possible to observe the influence of speed on the dynamic response. The amplifying effect\nof speed can influence the identification of damage, which is why a robust baseline with a wide range of scenarios is very important. At a speed of 40 km/h, lower accelerations\naround 0. m/s⊃2 are observed. In contrast, at a speed of 100 km/h (considerably higher),\naccelerations increase substantially to around 3. m/s⊃2. This illustrates the significant**Figure 6.** Acceleration time-series in sensor A1 for Laagrss vehicle: (a) influence of speed, (b) influencehigher speeds.

After obtaining the acceleration measurements from the numerical simulations, an FFT algorithm is applied to the time series allowing the conversion of the signal from the time domain to the frequency domain. Then,predefined hyperparameters of the algorithm. The set hyperparameters are encoding and\ndecoding transfer functions, hidden layer size, maximum number of epochs, L2 weight regularisation term, sparsity regularisation term and a sparsity proportion term. Afterwards,**Figure 7.** Flowchart with the main phases of the methodology for detection and classification of OORthe features are extracted in the more compressed layer of the SAE, the so-called bottleneck layer. The number of features obtained is equal to the number of hidden layers which\nis usually considerably lower than the data size, allowing a compression of the input data.\nFurthermore, to enhance the sensitivity to damage, two levels of data fusion are applied to the bottleneck features using the Mahalanobis distance. In the first level, all features are\nfused into a damage index (DI) for each sensor and, in the second level, all the sensors\nare merged resulting in only one DI for each simulation. Finally, automatic damage detection is achieved by performing an outlier analysis, in which a statistical confidence limit\n(CB) is used, based on the Inverse Cumulative Gaussian Distribution Function (ICDF).\nFor feature classification, an automatic clustering process based on the k-means technique is implemented. This algorithm allows for the unsupervised and automatic classification of data, based on the calculation of statistical distances between objects. In k-means technique given a vector of data and chosen k clusters, the key is to find k centroids that minimise\nthe distance of each vector to its nearest centroid . Since it is necessary to define the number of clusters in advance, a global Silhouette index (SIL) was adopted to make\nan automatic process. At the end, the clusters will allow the classification of the two typesbetween the number of correct classifications and the total number of cases.damage detection problems, as it allows a signal to be converted from the time domain to the frequency domain, to capture the excitation frequencies induced by the wheel defects.\nIn addition, a data reduction is carried out at this stage, since the initial records contain aa crossing speed of 80 km/h. When comparing the FFT spectra for a train passage with flats, Figure 8a), with polygonal wheels, Figure 8b), there are visible differences in terms\nof amplitude peak values and excited frequency ranges. For flats, the amplitude peak values are higher and they induce frequencies in the range between DC and 1500accordance with some authors reports . In terms of severities, for flats, the more severe group (55–100 mm) is the one with the higher frequency content, as expected,a baseline response. For polygonal wheels, from the analysis of Figure 8b), it can be seen the frequency peaks for the H12–14 and H17–18 profiles around 100 and 150\nrespectively, while for the profile H6-8 a more flat spectrum is obtained without showing any significant peak. This can be explained by the irregularity level profile of thisThese two graphs can show which frequencies have higher content in the original signal.Autoencoders are artificial neural networks trained using an unsupervised approach,\nwhich aim first to learn coded representations of the data, compressing the input into\na latent space representation, and second, through this compressed information, reconstructing the information. The basic architecture of this type of network consists of threewhere **Wij**, **Wjk** are the weights connection matrices between input layer-hidden\nlayer and hidden layer-output layer, **X** = ( **X** 1, **X** 2, . . ., **Xn** ) is the input data vector,\n**H** = ( **H** 1, . . ., **Hm** ) is the low-dimensional vector and **X** [ˆ] = ( **X** [ˆ] 1, **X** [ˆ] 2, . . ., **X** [ˆ] **n** ) is the output**Figure 8.** Frequency domain responses on position 1 for the crossing speed of 80 km/h: (a) wheel flats,data vector. **b** 1, **b** 2 are bias vectors and σ 1, σ 2 are the activation function used in each of thereconstruction of the input X [ˆ], as shown in Equation (3).

After incorporating various inputs into the SSAE training, they are integrated into the so-called\n‘Input 1’. As training progresses, the data is compressed, and the main characteristics of the signals are obtained and retained in ‘Bottleneck 1’. Subsequently, these characteristics are\nused as input for training the second sparse autoencoder, which, after further compression,\nenables the extraction of the final features. Depending on the type of data under analysis,\nthe compression level differs, so multiple tests should be conducted to optimise these layer sizes. This optimisation was achieved by trial and test, changing both the size of the first\nIt should be noted that this network architecture, where the dimensions of the layers gradually decrease along the network until reaching the bottleneck layer , has proven\nto be highly robust for the type of data used. It allows for effective compression of results**Figure 9.** Schematic of the structure of the SSAE neural network used in this study.After extracting the features from the bottleneck layer of the SSAE, the difference between the healthy wheels scenarios and the damage wheels scenarios is still not sufficient. Hence\na data fusion is performed. With this fusion, it is possible to increase the sensitivity of the\nfeatures, and as a result, to obtain a damage index (DI) for each simulation. Thus, the Mahalanobis distance (MD) is used to reduce the volume of extracted data and preserve the most relevant information . Briefly, MD is a metric that measures the distance between two points in a feature space consisting of two or more variables, being independent of the\nscale of the features, thus allowing an increase in the sensitivity of the features to cases with damage. The MD, denoted here as DI, is calculated for each simulation using the followingin which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−], and ¯ x is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The MD is calculated for each sensor and for each simulation, obtaining a matrix of n distances per k number of sensors.Finally, the discrimination of the features consists in distinguishing the features as corresponding to a healthy or damaged case. At this stage of the methodology, an analysis of\nabnormal values is carried out, which will allow the condition of the train wheels to beautomatically monitored and these values to be classified into different classes. This phaseThe outlier analysis consists of grouping, by probabilistic distribution processes, the datato the previously created group. For this, a statistical confidence limit (CB) is used, based on the inverse cumulative Gaussian distribution function (ICDF), considering the mean\nvalue, ¯ μ, and standard deviation, σ, of the baseline feature vector.Whenever a value of a DI indicator is equal to or greater than CB, it is considered an outlier (the null hypothesis is rejected), thus representing a case of damage.For feature classification, a clustering process is used to divide the dataset into distinct clusters that should be as compact and separated as possible . For clustering, the k-meanson the distances of their vectors. Recent studies showed that the k-means algorithm has shown promising results . The main limitation of this technique is that it requires\nknowledge of the number of clusters in advance. For this purpose, the global silhouetteThis section presents the main results obtained through the application of the methodology proposed in section 3 to the calculated track responses. The methodology is applied using damaged wheel passages for the three simulated train speeds (60, 80 and 100 km/h),hyperparameters (presented in section 3). By adjusting these hyperparameters, it is possible to make the algorithm more efficient and improve the generalisation capabilities, as only\nthe most important features are retained. The optimisation of these hyperparameters isof data under analysis. Based on the principles of the SAE already outlined in other works\nIn the context of this study, the non-linear transfer functions (logsig) proved to be more effective than the linear ones, being the ones used in all the studied cases. After analysing Table 3, there is a similarity in the hyperparameters when comparing the two types of OOR damage. It is observed that the data compression level is the same for both cases, around\n93%, as 500 features are extracted in Bottleneck 2 from the initial input data with 7000\nConcerning the type of damage situation, the size of the ‘Bottleneck 1’ and ‘Bottleneck\n2’ was increased to bring them even closer to the initial amount of input data. This can beanalysis, making it challenging for the autoencoder to define relationships between the data, hence requiring a larger number. On the contrary, the maximum number of epochsIt is also important to emphasise that of the various hyperparameters presented, theOnce the hyperparameters have been defined, all the steps of the methodology are applied to the new dataset. For simplicity, in this section, only the last phase of the methodology will be presented, namely an outlier analysis for damage detection and cluster analysis for damage classification. For each sensor, a matrix n × m is created, where n\nis the number of test passages (baseline scenarios + damage scenarios), and m represents the number of extracted features. So, the size of the matrices is 210 × 2000 in case of the\ntype of damage, 75 × 500 for each amplitude in polygonal wheel, and 120 × 500 for wheelDespite the visual distinction between healthy and damaged wheels based on the data processing presented in subsection 3.2, unsupervised learning must use strategies capable of automatically detecting damage. To this end, an outlier analysis is employed, which consists of defining a confidence threshold using a significance level of 1% , represented**Figure 10.** Automatic OOR damage detection based on outlier analysis.by the green line in Figure 10. This approach makes it possible to successfully detect allTo distinguish the two types of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed. Figure 11\nshows a clear distinction between the damage, even when using a dataset with three different train speeds (60,80 and 100 km/h).. In the case of Figure 11a), using all four\naccelerometers, it is possible to efficiently separate the set into two large clusters, despite\n30 misclassifications (16 in the polygonisation and 14 in the flats). Even so, the accuracy\npercentage is around 85%, which is a very good result. To analyse the sensitivity to the number of sensors, only two sensors were used, one on each side ). The results\nimproved, with a decrease in the number of misclassifications from 30 to 21 (13 for polygonisation and 8 for flats). One explanation could be the disparity in sensor sensitivity to the damage, where some sensors are more sensitive than others due to their spatial positioning in relation to the damage. By merging the data from the less sensitive sensors with the\nmore sensitive ones, this could have a negative impact on the results. Thus, the percentage\nThe purpose behind presenting these two plots was to demonstrate that, whether using 4 sensors or 2 sensors, the classification remains remarkably robust, showing lowAfter identifying the type of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed once again to\nclassify the severity of each damage separately. Regarding polygonal wheels, the classification involves both amplitude and harmonic orders, leading to the clusters depicted in the obtained clusters reasonably reflect the two amplitude groups, with all misclassifications associated with the H6-8 harmonic cases (17 misclassifications). Once the amplitude\nis identified, harmonic classification must be carried out separately for each of the amplitudes. In Figure 12b), related to amplitude A1, it is observed that the obtained clusters**Figure 11.** Automatic OOR damage classification based on cluster analysis using: a) 4 sensors; b) 2are nearly perfect, with only 3 misclassifications. In Figure 12c), there are only 3 misclassifications, totalling 8 misclassifications in the classification of the number of dominant\nThe classification of harmonic order is only possible with the separation of amplitudes,\nFigure 13 presents the clusters obtained for the wheel flat cases. The separation between\nthe less severe group and baseline cases and intermediate (cluster 3) and severe cases (cluster 4) is reduced, resulting in a total of 19 misclassifications. Nevertheless, this result showsrate of about 84%. One possible reason for this significant number of misclassifications could be directly associated with the number of impacts captured by the sensor.In order to contribute to the safety of railway transportation and service quality, an automatic methodology based on machine learning has been proposed. This methodology can accurately detect and classify two types of OOR wheel damage in railway vehicles allowing to mitigate problems at both track and vehicle level, such as derailments or material\ndegradation. It includes a new technique for feature extraction based on a dedicated neural network, the Sparse Autoencoder. This non-linear technique is an upgrade concerning the commonly used linear techniques for feature extraction since it allows a better normalisation of the operational effects in the analysed data, as well as the reduction of large amounts\nof data without relying on other techniques, while keeping the most valuable information. These improvements are achieved through the use of different hyperparameters in**Figure 12.** Automatic classification of polygonal wheels based on cluster analysis: a) amplitude A1-A2;**Figure 13.** Automatic classification of wheel flats based on cluster analysis.the calculations, such as non-linear activation functions and sparsity terms. Consequently,circulation. Particularly in the railway engineering field, the inclusion of this technique\nshowed a good potential to deal with variable train speeds, essentially due to the amplifying effect on the measured track dynamic responses which could induce errors in damage The application of the methodology to the data set proved to be very successful in detecting and classifying the two types of OOR damages. Damage detection was perfect, without\nany false detection. In terms of classifying the type of damage, the results are very good,\nwith a success rate of around 85%, but if only two accelerometers are considered the successrate increases to around 90%. These results are encouraging since the range of speeds considered in the analysis, between 60 and 100 km/h, is the most representative of in-service\nfreight trains. Also, the results show that including the Sparse Autoencoder has a positive\neffect in the normalization of the train speed in the damage data set.\nRegarding the severity classification for each type of damage, the methodology proved equally successful in clustering the different damage severities. For polygonal wheels, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the severity groups in terms of defect amplitude, failing only for the H6-8 harmonic cases, and in terms of harmonic orders for each amplitude,\nwith almost perfect results. For wheel flats, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the three severity groups, though with some misclassifications between the less severe group\nand baseline cases and between intermediate and severe cases. A success rate of around 86%\nis achieved in the classification of polygonal wheel severities and 84% in the classification of wheel flat severities. Even so, these high success rates of over 80% show the robustness\nof this methodology in damage classification regardless of the train speed.on on-site measurements. Additionally, this methodology could be carried out for other types of railway vehicles, for example, passenger vehicles, since the dynamic responses are\ndifferent from freight vehicles. In that case, exploring other recent types of autoencoders,\nTo increase the complexity of the problem, the objective is to explore the concept of\nmultiple damages (same or different OOR types). For this, it will be necessary to incorporate a new stage in the methodology, the damage location stage, which will make it possible\nto distinguish isolated damage from multiple damage, as well as their respective location.\nThus, damage will be identified using cut signals, which will then be used to classify theThis work is a result of project WAY4SafeRail-WAYside monitoring system FOR SAFE RAIL transportation, with reference NORTE-01-0247-FEDER-069595, co-funded by the European Regional\nDevelopment Fund (ERDF), through the North Portugal Regional Operational Programme\nPartnership Agreement.

Within this context,\nan unsupervised methodology based on artificial intelligence techniques is presented, which allows the detection and classification of wheels, based on dynamic responses induced on the track by crossing freight railway vehicles. The methodology involves the following\nsteps: (i) data collection and pre-processing, (ii) feature extraction (iii)\ndata fusion and (iv) feature discrimination. In the first phase, an FFT\nalgorithm is applied to the acceleration track responses. Then, features are extracted after training a Stacked Sparse Autoencoder, in which the main features of the responses are obtained after a compression stage using an encoder network.

Posteriorly, an outlier analysis is performed to distinguish a healthy wheelRail vehicle wheels are subjected to constant wear and tear due to continuous use and inadequate maintenance plans. Over time, this wear and tear can generate more significant defects, so it is extremely important to use sensing to understand when maintenance of both the track and rolling stock is required.

However, this type of system entail high costs envisaging the vehicle wheel condition monitoring, since sensors need to be installed in every vehicle in order to achieve a good representativity . On the other hand, wayside systems are a more viable solution for identifying wheel defects, since the condition of allThe most common wheel defects are known as OOR. As the name infers, this defect is related to deformations on the surface of the wheel circumference that make it not round.\nThis deformation can have many forms and different causes, leading to faults on the vehicle and on the track due to the higher dynamic force values [4–6]. The OOR damagesa function of their shape and size, vehicle characteristics and speed [7–10]. Wheel flats induce high dynamic impact loads on the railway infrastructure, which causes significant damage to both tracks and vehicles, such as broken axles, damaged rolling bearings and cracks in the wheels, rails and sleepers . Moreover, it also generates high vibrations\ntransmitted to the rolling stock, inducing significant stresses and causing damage to the In the case of polygonal wheels, the formation mechanism can be roughly classified\ninto three categories, namely, (1) initial wheel defects , (2) a natural vibration of the\nvehicle–track system and (3) thermoelastic instability . The formation mechanism is strongly contingent on the vehicle type and its operational characteristics, withof dominant harmonic orders [19–22]. For example, Tao et al. studied asymmetrical polygonal wear on metro wheels and obtained harmonic orders of 12–14, while another study by Tao et al. found that the most common harmonic order in Chinese freight trains is 18–19. Although a polygonal wheel could generate less impact on the track than a\nwheel flat, this defect can cause serious damage to the track due to resonance effects in the\nTo identify the occurrence of these OOR anomalies in train wheels, innovative\nmethodologies have been developed combining signal processing and automatic learning techniques. These methodologies are based on the extraction of damage sensitivity features, making possible the distinction between undamaged and damaged situations. Recently, many studies have shown good results in detecting OOR damages using\ndistinct approaches [24–29]. Mishra et al. concluded that a single FBG (Fiber Bragg Grating) sensor, positioned along the rail can detect the presence of wheel flats.\nLourenço et al. created an automatic algorithm for diagnosing OOR defects. The\nproposed methodology consists of isolating specific defective wheels and then identifying the severity of the damage, using only acceleration and strain data measured on\nthe track. In another study, Krummenacher et al. , proposed two machine-learningBy extracting the features, it is possible to transform the measured data into an alternative form of information where the correlation with damage is more easily observed. There are various techniques for feature extraction, the most common being CWT\n(continuous wavelet transform) [31–33], PCA (principal component analysis) ,detection of polygonal wheels on freight vehicles using CWT and ARX features, using\n6 accelerometers, 3 on each side of the railway track. Mosleh et al. introduced aflats by extracting AR features from acceleration records. Moreover, Mohammadi et al.\nadopted linear features, particularly, CWT, PCA, ARX and AR, and their research findingsin the context of wheel flat damage detection. Although these studies have demonstrated robust results in detection, they show some limitations in dealing with the non-linear effects associated with operational effects, such as the train speed. Due to the inability of these linear techniques to attenuate operation effects, the inclusion of different speeds\nFor most of these studies, a feature normalisation stage is used when it is necessary to remove the operational effects. Usually, latent variable methods are used, such as PCA or multiple linear regression (MLR) . Thus, to deal with the non-linear phenomena and reduce the large amounts of data without relying on the aforementioned methods,\nthe first artificial neural networks were created to inherently execute this task . Over the years, new and more advanced networks have been developed, with the Autoencoder\n(AE) being one of the main types. Later, Olshausen et al. proposed the creation of\nsparse coding and Ng et al. introduced a sparse penalisation term in the hidden layer,\nto acquire more compact and effective features from lower-dimensional data. For some datasets with complex relationships between characteristics, employing more than one SAE\nis necessary, which is why stacked sparse autoencoders (SSAE) are commonly used .\nNowadays, these types of AE are widely used in various scientific fields, but specifically\nfor structural engineering only a few studies are found, and most are about damage detection on bridges [45–47].

However, the AE methods can also be combined with other techniques commonly used to classify the data.

The application of sensors on both sides of theTo obtain the responses from the railway track, it is necessary to apply sensors on the track that can measure the dynamic responses of the crossing trains. As it is not always possible\nto install them due to the high costs involved, simulations have been carried out based on calibrated models of the track , vehicle and considering their dynamic interaction,\nas well as including the track irregularities.

Including the track irregularities directly in the constraint equations are beneficial since it avoids explicitly considering\nthem in the FEM model. Moreover, it also allows to include the wheel and OOR profiles as a periodic rail irregularity, simplifying the analysis. Thus, before starting the analysis, the\nVSI software imports track irregularities and OOR profiles from a MATLAB file, whichto the vertical and lateral irregularities in each rail in each respective position, and adds it to the constraint equations of the system throughout the dynamics analysis. Then, the\nsystem of dynamic equations is solved using the typical Newmark integration method.\nThe impact of track irregularity on wheel defect classification is significant, as a lower track quality tends to result in a higher likelihood of misclassification. A comprehensive\nexploration of this influence was previously undertaken by Mosleh et al. as documented in their research study . Hence, this study does not delve into the impact of track\nquality; rather, it primarily centres on the utilisation of AI-based methodologies for the detection and classification of wheel defects. For this, four different profiles are used, based\non European Standard EN 13848–2 . In this case, power spectral density (PSD) curvesFor OOR defects, several profiles are defined based on real measurements in representative profiles of the various severities. Subsequently, the structural matrices are imported\nMore details on track and train properties, including additional information on traintrack interaction, can be found in previous publications . Figure 1 shows the\nvehicle–track interaction model schematisation and some details about the train and track\nsubsystems, as well as the track irregularities and wheel-rail contact model.According to the conclusions reached in other studies with this type of damage ,\nthe most promising location of the sensors is on the rail. To reduce installation and maintenance costs, it is important to reduce the number of sensors without compromising the\nquality of the results. Therefore, based on a sensitivity analysis performed during the study,\nonly two vertical unidirectional accelerometers were used on each rail, 4 in total (A1 to A4),\nsince they provided a higher cost–benefit ratio. These sensors are mounted on the rail atdefects, different simulation scenarios with perfect wheels (baseline) and OOR wheels\n(damage) were defined for a five-wagon Laagrss freight train. Based on different crossing speeds, loading schemes and rail irregularities profiles, 120 baseline and 180 damage scenarios (90 for polygonal wheels and 90 for wheel flats) were defined, as summarised in For baseline scenarios, six loading schemes with five different speeds (40, 60, 80, 100\nand 120 km/h) and four rail irregularity profiles were considered, giving a total of 120 scenarios. The loading schemes used are: empty, half-loaded, full-loaded and, additionally,For the damage cases, a total of 90 scenarios were generated for polygonal wheels. These\nscenarios including 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (H1, H2 and H3) x 10 different irregularity profiles within each specified harmonic interval. In these 10 irregularity\nprofiles, based on the defect amplitude, two amplitudes are considered, five simulations for\nA1 and five simulations for A2. Similarly, 90 scenarios were created for wheel flats, involving 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (F1, F2 and F3) x 10 different irregularitywheel radius . This wave phenomenon can be characterised by the different wavelengths formed (harmonics θ ), and by the levels of irregularity ( Lw ) associated with each of the harmonics. According to Peng , it is considered a polygonal wheel when the wear amplitude assumes values above 0. mm and wavelengths between 140 mm and the wheelTo define scenarios with polygonal wheels for the Laagrss wagon, a literature survey on\nexperimental measurements in defective wheels was conducted .

At a speed of 40 km/h, lower accelerations\naround 0. m/s⊃2 are observed. In contrast, at a speed of 100 km/h (considerably higher),\naccelerations increase substantially to around 3. m/s⊃2. This illustrates the significant**Figure 6.** Acceleration time-series in sensor A1 for Laagrss vehicle: (a) influence of speed, (b) influencehigher speeds. In Figure 6b), the influence of the load scheme is observed in the baseline\nresponses, considering the same speed (60 km/h) and the same type of irregularity (Irregularity 2). Lastly, Figure 6c) and d), show two acceleration responses for the two types of simulated OOR damages. Compared to a perfect wheel, there is a significant increase of the peak values, more localised in the case of flats ) and more distributed in thethe wheel condition is based on Machine Learning (ML) and comprises several phases,\nsummarised in the flowchart presented in Figure 7. After obtaining the acceleration measurements from the numerical simulations, an FFT algorithm is applied to the time series allowing the conversion of the signal from the time domain to the frequency domain. Then,predefined hyperparameters of the algorithm. The set hyperparameters are encoding and\ndecoding transfer functions, hidden layer size, maximum number of epochs, L2 weight regularisation term, sparsity regularisation term and a sparsity proportion term. Afterwards,**Figure 7.** Flowchart with the main phases of the methodology for detection and classification of OORthe features are extracted in the more compressed layer of the SAE, the so-called bottleneck layer. The number of features obtained is equal to the number of hidden layers which\nis usually considerably lower than the data size, allowing a compression of the input data.\nFurthermore, to enhance the sensitivity to damage, two levels of data fusion are applied to the bottleneck features using the Mahalanobis distance. In the first level, all features are\nfused into a damage index (DI) for each sensor and, in the second level, all the sensors\nare merged resulting in only one DI for each simulation. Finally, automatic damage detection is achieved by performing an outlier analysis, in which a statistical confidence limit\n(CB) is used, based on the Inverse Cumulative Gaussian Distribution Function (ICDF).\nFor feature classification, an automatic clustering process based on the k-means technique is implemented. This algorithm allows for the unsupervised and automatic classification of data, based on the calculation of statistical distances between objects. In k-means technique given a vector of data and chosen k clusters, the key is to find k centroids that minimise\nthe distance of each vector to its nearest centroid . Since it is necessary to define the number of clusters in advance, a global Silhouette index (SIL) was adopted to make\nan automatic process. At the end, the clusters will allow the classification of the two typesbetween the number of correct classifications and the total number of cases.damage detection problems, as it allows a signal to be converted from the time domain to the frequency domain, to capture the excitation frequencies induced by the wheel defects.\nIn addition, a data reduction is carried out at this stage, since the initial records contain aa crossing speed of 80 km/h. When comparing the FFT spectra for a train passage with flats, Figure 8a), with polygonal wheels, Figure 8b), there are visible differences in terms\nof amplitude peak values and excited frequency ranges. For flats, the amplitude peak values are higher and they induce frequencies in the range between DC and 1500accordance with some authors reports . In terms of severities, for flats, the more severe group (55–100 mm) is the one with the higher frequency content, as expected,a baseline response. For polygonal wheels, from the analysis of Figure 8b), it can be seen the frequency peaks for the H12–14 and H17–18 profiles around 100 and 150\nrespectively, while for the profile H6-8 a more flat spectrum is obtained without showing any significant peak. This can be explained by the irregularity level profile of thisThese two graphs can show which frequencies have higher content in the original signal.Autoencoders are artificial neural networks trained using an unsupervised approach,\nwhich aim first to learn coded representations of the data, compressing the input into\na latent space representation, and second, through this compressed information, reconstructing the information. The basic architecture of this type of network consists of threewhere **Wij**, **Wjk** are the weights connection matrices between input layer-hidden\nlayer and hidden layer-output layer, **X** = ( **X** 1, **X** 2, . . ., **Xn** ) is the input data vector,\n**H** = ( **H** 1, . . ., **Hm** ) is the low-dimensional vector and **X** [ˆ] = ( **X** [ˆ] 1, **X** [ˆ] 2, . . ., **X** [ˆ] **n** ) is the output**Figure 8.** Frequency domain responses on position 1 for the crossing speed of 80 km/h: (a) wheel flats,data vector. **b** 1, **b** 2 are bias vectors and σ 1, σ 2 are the activation function used in each of thereconstruction of the input X [ˆ], as shown in Equation (3). This function uses the meanIn the Sparse Autoencoder, to make the coding more efficient, two regularisation terms,\nsparse penalty term and weight regularisation term, are added to the error function, causing only a subset of neurons to be activated. The average activation of neurons in the hiddenAs the average activation ˆ ρ is intended to be close to a constant ρ (sparsity proportion)\nand it is usually a small positive number near 0, the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence isIn addition to this, a weight regularisation term, called L2 regularisation, is also addedwhere L is the number of hidden layers, nl the output size of layer l, kl the input size ofwhere μ is the coefficient for the L2 regularisation term and β the coefficient for the sparsityAfter data pre-processing, the acceleration responses in the frequency domain, are then In this work, two layers of SAE’s were used to form the network, as shown in Figure 9.layers, with the outputs of the previous autoencoder serving as input for the next one. After incorporating various inputs into the SSAE training, they are integrated into the so-called\n‘Input 1’. As training progresses, the data is compressed, and the main characteristics of the signals are obtained and retained in ‘Bottleneck 1’. Subsequently, these characteristics are\nused as input for training the second sparse autoencoder, which, after further compression,\nenables the extraction of the final features. Depending on the type of data under analysis,\nthe compression level differs, so multiple tests should be conducted to optimise these layer sizes. This optimisation was achieved by trial and test, changing both the size of the first\nIt should be noted that this network architecture, where the dimensions of the layers gradually decrease along the network until reaching the bottleneck layer , has proven\nto be highly robust for the type of data used. It allows for effective compression of results**Figure 9.** Schematic of the structure of the SSAE neural network used in this study.After extracting the features from the bottleneck layer of the SSAE, the difference between the healthy wheels scenarios and the damage wheels scenarios is still not sufficient. Hence\na data fusion is performed. With this fusion, it is possible to increase the sensitivity of the\nfeatures, and as a result, to obtain a damage index (DI) for each simulation. Thus, the Mahalanobis distance (MD) is used to reduce the volume of extracted data and preserve the most relevant information . Briefly, MD is a metric that measures the distance between two points in a feature space consisting of two or more variables, being independent of the\nscale of the features, thus allowing an increase in the sensitivity of the features to cases with damage. The MD, denoted here as DI, is calculated for each simulation using the followingin which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−], and ¯ x is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The MD is calculated for each sensor and for each simulation, obtaining a matrix of n distances per k number of sensors.Finally, the discrimination of the features consists in distinguishing the features as corresponding to a healthy or damaged case. At this stage of the methodology, an analysis of\nabnormal values is carried out, which will allow the condition of the train wheels to beautomatically monitored and these values to be classified into different classes. This phaseThe outlier analysis consists of grouping, by probabilistic distribution processes, the datato the previously created group. For this, a statistical confidence limit (CB) is used, based on the inverse cumulative Gaussian distribution function (ICDF), considering the mean\nvalue, ¯ μ, and standard deviation, σ, of the baseline feature vector.Whenever a value of a DI indicator is equal to or greater than CB, it is considered an outlier (the null hypothesis is rejected), thus representing a case of damage.For feature classification, a clustering process is used to divide the dataset into distinct clusters that should be as compact and separated as possible . For clustering, the k-meanson the distances of their vectors. Recent studies showed that the k-means algorithm has shown promising results . The main limitation of this technique is that it requires\nknowledge of the number of clusters in advance. For this purpose, the global silhouetteThis section presents the main results obtained through the application of the methodology proposed in section 3 to the calculated track responses. The methodology is applied using damaged wheel passages for the three simulated train speeds (60, 80 and 100 km/h),hyperparameters (presented in section 3). By adjusting these hyperparameters, it is possible to make the algorithm more efficient and improve the generalisation capabilities, as only\nthe most important features are retained. The optimisation of these hyperparameters isof data under analysis. Based on the principles of the SAE already outlined in other works\nIn the context of this study, the non-linear transfer functions (logsig) proved to be more effective than the linear ones, being the ones used in all the studied cases. After analysing Table 3, there is a similarity in the hyperparameters when comparing the two types of OOR damage. It is observed that the data compression level is the same for both cases, around\n93%, as 500 features are extracted in Bottleneck 2 from the initial input data with 7000\nConcerning the type of damage situation, the size of the ‘Bottleneck 1’ and ‘Bottleneck\n2’ was increased to bring them even closer to the initial amount of input data. This can beanalysis, making it challenging for the autoencoder to define relationships between the data, hence requiring a larger number. On the contrary, the maximum number of epochsIt is also important to emphasise that of the various hyperparameters presented, theOnce the hyperparameters have been defined, all the steps of the methodology are applied to the new dataset. For simplicity, in this section, only the last phase of the methodology will be presented, namely an outlier analysis for damage detection and cluster analysis for damage classification. For each sensor, a matrix n × m is created, where n\nis the number of test passages (baseline scenarios + damage scenarios), and m represents the number of extracted features. So, the size of the matrices is 210 × 2000 in case of the\ntype of damage, 75 × 500 for each amplitude in polygonal wheel, and 120 × 500 for wheelDespite the visual distinction between healthy and damaged wheels based on the data processing presented in subsection 3.2, unsupervised learning must use strategies capable of automatically detecting damage. To this end, an outlier analysis is employed, which consists of defining a confidence threshold using a significance level of 1% , represented**Figure 10.** Automatic OOR damage detection based on outlier analysis.by the green line in Figure 10. This approach makes it possible to successfully detect allTo distinguish the two types of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed. Figure 11\nshows a clear distinction between the damage, even when using a dataset with three different train speeds (60,80 and 100 km/h).. In the case of Figure 11a), using all four\naccelerometers, it is possible to efficiently separate the set into two large clusters, despite\n30 misclassifications (16 in the polygonisation and 14 in the flats). Even so, the accuracy\npercentage is around 85%, which is a very good result. To analyse the sensitivity to the number of sensors, only two sensors were used, one on each side ). The results\nimproved, with a decrease in the number of misclassifications from 30 to 21 (13 for polygonisation and 8 for flats). One explanation could be the disparity in sensor sensitivity to the damage, where some sensors are more sensitive than others due to their spatial positioning in relation to the damage. By merging the data from the less sensitive sensors with the\nmore sensitive ones, this could have a negative impact on the results. Thus, the percentage\nThe purpose behind presenting these two plots was to demonstrate that, whether using 4 sensors or 2 sensors, the classification remains remarkably robust, showing lowAfter identifying the type of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed once again to\nclassify the severity of each damage separately. Regarding polygonal wheels, the classification involves both amplitude and harmonic orders, leading to the clusters depicted in the obtained clusters reasonably reflect the two amplitude groups, with all misclassifications associated with the H6-8 harmonic cases (17 misclassifications). Once the amplitude\nis identified, harmonic classification must be carried out separately for each of the amplitudes. In Figure 12b), related to amplitude A1, it is observed that the obtained clusters**Figure 11.** Automatic OOR damage classification based on cluster analysis using: a) 4 sensors; b) 2are nearly perfect, with only 3 misclassifications. In Figure 12c), there are only 3 misclassifications, totalling 8 misclassifications in the classification of the number of dominant\nThe classification of harmonic order is only possible with the separation of amplitudes,\nFigure 13 presents the clusters obtained for the wheel flat cases. The separation between\nthe less severe group and baseline cases and intermediate (cluster 3) and severe cases (cluster 4) is reduced, resulting in a total of 19 misclassifications. Nevertheless, this result showsrate of about 84%. One possible reason for this significant number of misclassifications could be directly associated with the number of impacts captured by the sensor.In order to contribute to the safety of railway transportation and service quality, an automatic methodology based on machine learning has been proposed. This methodology can accurately detect and classify two types of OOR wheel damage in railway vehicles allowing to mitigate problems at both track and vehicle level, such as derailments or material\ndegradation. It includes a new technique for feature extraction based on a dedicated neural network, the Sparse Autoencoder. This non-linear technique is an upgrade concerning the commonly used linear techniques for feature extraction since it allows a better normalisation of the operational effects in the analysed data, as well as the reduction of large amounts\nof data without relying on other techniques, while keeping the most valuable information. These improvements are achieved through the use of different hyperparameters in**Figure 12.** Automatic classification of polygonal wheels based on cluster analysis: a) amplitude A1-A2;**Figure 13.** Automatic classification of wheel flats based on cluster analysis.the calculations, such as non-linear activation functions and sparsity terms. Consequently,circulation. Particularly in the railway engineering field, the inclusion of this technique\nshowed a good potential to deal with variable train speeds, essentially due to the amplifying effect on the measured track dynamic responses which could induce errors in damage The application of the methodology to the data set proved to be very successful in detecting and classifying the two types of OOR damages. Damage detection was perfect, without\nany false detection. In terms of classifying the type of damage, the results are very good,\nwith a success rate of around 85%, but if only two accelerometers are considered the successrate increases to around 90%. These results are encouraging since the range of speeds considered in the analysis, between 60 and 100 km/h, is the most representative of in-service\nfreight trains. Also, the results show that including the Sparse Autoencoder has a positive\neffect in the normalization of the train speed in the damage data set.\nRegarding the severity classification for each type of damage, the methodology proved equally successful in clustering the different damage severities. For polygonal wheels, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the severity groups in terms of defect amplitude, failing only for the H6-8 harmonic cases, and in terms of harmonic orders for each amplitude,\nwith almost perfect results. For wheel flats, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the three severity groups, though with some misclassifications between the less severe group\nand baseline cases and between intermediate and severe cases. A success rate of around 86%\nis achieved in the classification of polygonal wheel severities and 84% in the classification of wheel flat severities. Even so, these high success rates of over 80% show the robustness\nof this methodology in damage classification regardless of the train speed.on on-site measurements. Additionally, this methodology could be carried out for other types of railway vehicles, for example, passenger vehicles, since the dynamic responses are\ndifferent from freight vehicles. In that case, exploring other recent types of autoencoders,\nTo increase the complexity of the problem, the objective is to explore the concept of\nmultiple damages (same or different OOR types). For this, it will be necessary to incorporate a new stage in the methodology, the damage location stage, which will make it possible\nto distinguish isolated damage from multiple damage, as well as their respective location.\nThus, damage will be identified using cut signals, which will then be used to classify theThis work is a result of project WAY4SafeRail-WAYside monitoring system FOR SAFE RAIL transportation, with reference NORTE-01-0247-FEDER-069595, co-funded by the European Regional\nDevelopment Fund (ERDF), through the North Portugal Regional Operational Programme\nPartnership Agreement.

However, this type of system entail high costs envisaging the vehicle wheel condition monitoring, since sensors need to be installed in every vehicle in order to achieve a good representativity . On the other hand, wayside systems are a more viable solution for identifying wheel defects, since the condition of allThe most common wheel defects are known as OOR. As the name infers, this defect is related to deformations on the surface of the wheel circumference that make it not round.\nThis deformation can have many forms and different causes, leading to faults on the vehicle and on the track due to the higher dynamic force values [4–6]. The OOR damagesa function of their shape and size, vehicle characteristics and speed [7–10]. Wheel flats induce high dynamic impact loads on the railway infrastructure, which causes significant damage to both tracks and vehicles, such as broken axles, damaged rolling bearings and cracks in the wheels, rails and sleepers . Moreover, it also generates high vibrations\ntransmitted to the rolling stock, inducing significant stresses and causing damage to the In the case of polygonal wheels, the formation mechanism can be roughly classified\ninto three categories, namely, (1) initial wheel defects , (2) a natural vibration of the\nvehicle–track system and (3) thermoelastic instability . The formation mechanism is strongly contingent on the vehicle type and its operational characteristics, withof dominant harmonic orders [19–22]. For example, Tao et al. studied asymmetrical polygonal wear on metro wheels and obtained harmonic orders of 12–14, while another study by Tao et al. found that the most common harmonic order in Chinese freight trains is 18–19. Although a polygonal wheel could generate less impact on the track than a\nwheel flat, this defect can cause serious damage to the track due to resonance effects in the\nTo identify the occurrence of these OOR anomalies in train wheels, innovative\nmethodologies have been developed combining signal processing and automatic learning techniques. These methodologies are based on the extraction of damage sensitivity features, making possible the distinction between undamaged and damaged situations. Recently, many studies have shown good results in detecting OOR damages using\ndistinct approaches [24–29]. Mishra et al. concluded that a single FBG (Fiber Bragg Grating) sensor, positioned along the rail can detect the presence of wheel flats.\nLourenço et al. created an automatic algorithm for diagnosing OOR defects. The\nproposed methodology consists of isolating specific defective wheels and then identifying the severity of the damage, using only acceleration and strain data measured on\nthe track. In another study, Krummenacher et al. , proposed two machine-learningBy extracting the features, it is possible to transform the measured data into an alternative form of information where the correlation with damage is more easily observed. There are various techniques for feature extraction, the most common being CWT\n(continuous wavelet transform) [31–33], PCA (principal component analysis) ,detection of polygonal wheels on freight vehicles using CWT and ARX features, using\n6 accelerometers, 3 on each side of the railway track.

Although these studies have demonstrated robust results in detection, they show some limitations in dealing with the non-linear effects associated with operational effects, such as the train speed. Due to the inability of these linear techniques to attenuate operation effects, the inclusion of different speeds\nFor most of these studies, a feature normalisation stage is used when it is necessary to remove the operational effects. Usually, latent variable methods are used, such as PCA or multiple linear regression (MLR) . Thus, to deal with the non-linear phenomena and reduce the large amounts of data without relying on the aforementioned methods,\nthe first artificial neural networks were created to inherently execute this task . Over the years, new and more advanced networks have been developed, with the Autoencoder\n(AE) being one of the main types. Later, Olshausen et al. proposed the creation of\nsparse coding and Ng et al. introduced a sparse penalisation term in the hidden layer,\nto acquire more compact and effective features from lower-dimensional data. For some datasets with complex relationships between characteristics, employing more than one SAE\nis necessary, which is why stacked sparse autoencoders (SSAE) are commonly used .\nNowadays, these types of AE are widely used in various scientific fields, but specifically\nfor structural engineering only a few studies are found, and most are about damage detection on bridges [45–47].

However, the AE methods can also be combined with other techniques commonly used to classify the data. They can be used unsupervised methods, in which the model is trained without any labels provided to the\ntraining dataset, such as k-means , self-organising maps (SOM) , isolation forest, gaussian mixture model , k-medoids and cluster analysis , or supervised\nmethods, which assume that the hierarchy of database categories is known, such as NaiveBayes classifiers , k-Nearest Neighbours classifiers , Support Vector Machinetwo types of OOR damages, flats and polygonal wheels, based on acceleration responses obtained from a virtual wayside monitoring system.

The application of sensors on both sides of theTo obtain the responses from the railway track, it is necessary to apply sensors on the track that can measure the dynamic responses of the crossing trains. As it is not always possible\nto install them due to the high costs involved, simulations have been carried out based on calibrated models of the track , vehicle and considering their dynamic interaction,\nas well as including the track irregularities. Simulations include cases with healthy wheelsTo simulate the dynamic interactions between the vehicle and the track, an in-house software VSI – Vehicle-Structure Interaction Analysis is used, which was initially developed by\nNeves et al. and later improved by Montenegro et al. .

Including the track irregularities directly in the constraint equations are beneficial since it avoids explicitly considering\nthem in the FEM model. Moreover, it also allows to include the wheel and OOR profiles as a periodic rail irregularity, simplifying the analysis. Thus, before starting the analysis, the\nVSI software imports track irregularities and OOR profiles from a MATLAB file, whichto the vertical and lateral irregularities in each rail in each respective position, and adds it to the constraint equations of the system throughout the dynamics analysis. Then, the\nsystem of dynamic equations is solved using the typical Newmark integration method.\nThe impact of track irregularity on wheel defect classification is significant, as a lower track quality tends to result in a higher likelihood of misclassification. A comprehensive\nexploration of this influence was previously undertaken by Mosleh et al. as documented in their research study . Hence, this study does not delve into the impact of track\nquality; rather, it primarily centres on the utilisation of AI-based methodologies for the detection and classification of wheel defects. For this, four different profiles are used, based\non European Standard EN 13848–2 . In this case, power spectral density (PSD) curvesFor OOR defects, several profiles are defined based on real measurements in representative profiles of the various severities. Subsequently, the structural matrices are imported\nMore details on track and train properties, including additional information on traintrack interaction, can be found in previous publications . Figure 1 shows the\nvehicle–track interaction model schematisation and some details about the train and track\nsubsystems, as well as the track irregularities and wheel-rail contact model.According to the conclusions reached in other studies with this type of damage ,\nthe most promising location of the sensors is on the rail. To reduce installation and maintenance costs, it is important to reduce the number of sensors without compromising the\nquality of the results. Therefore, based on a sensitivity analysis performed during the study,\nonly two vertical unidirectional accelerometers were used on each rail, 4 in total (A1 to A4),\nsince they provided a higher cost–benefit ratio. These sensors are mounted on the rail atdefects, different simulation scenarios with perfect wheels (baseline) and OOR wheels\n(damage) were defined for a five-wagon Laagrss freight train. Based on different crossing speeds, loading schemes and rail irregularities profiles, 120 baseline and 180 damage scenarios (90 for polygonal wheels and 90 for wheel flats) were defined, as summarised in For baseline scenarios, six loading schemes with five different speeds (40, 60, 80, 100\nand 120 km/h) and four rail irregularity profiles were considered, giving a total of 120 scenarios. The loading schemes used are: empty, half-loaded, full-loaded and, additionally,For the damage cases, a total of 90 scenarios were generated for polygonal wheels. These\nscenarios including 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (H1, H2 and H3) x 10 different irregularity profiles within each specified harmonic interval. In these 10 irregularity\nprofiles, based on the defect amplitude, two amplitudes are considered, five simulations for\nA1 and five simulations for A2. Similarly, 90 scenarios were created for wheel flats, involving 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (F1, F2 and F3) x 10 different irregularitywheel radius . This wave phenomenon can be characterised by the different wavelengths formed (harmonics θ ), and by the levels of irregularity ( Lw ) associated with each of the harmonics. According to Peng , it is considered a polygonal wheel when the wear amplitude assumes values above 0. mm and wavelengths between 140 mm and the wheelTo define scenarios with polygonal wheels for the Laagrss wagon, a literature survey on\nexperimental measurements in defective wheels was conducted . Three experimental irregularity profiles were collected, illustrated in Figure 3. The first group (H6-8)\ncorresponds to a study carried out by Cai et al. with dominant harmonics from 6 to 8;**Figure 3.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) of polygonal wheels with**Figure 4.** Examples of polygonal damage profiles for each of the dominant harmonic intervals.the second group (H12-14) to a study authored by Tao et al. with dominant harmonics from 12 to 14; and the third profile (H17-18) to a study performed by Wu et al. with\nBased on the wheel irregularity spectra ( Lw ) taken from the respective measurement profiles, shown in Figure 3, and considering the contribution of the first 30 harmonics, several irregularity profiles were generated, according to Figure 4.

Then,predefined hyperparameters of the algorithm. The set hyperparameters are encoding and\ndecoding transfer functions, hidden layer size, maximum number of epochs, L2 weight regularisation term, sparsity regularisation term and a sparsity proportion term. Afterwards,**Figure 7.** Flowchart with the main phases of the methodology for detection and classification of OORthe features are extracted in the more compressed layer of the SAE, the so-called bottleneck layer. The number of features obtained is equal to the number of hidden layers which\nis usually considerably lower than the data size, allowing a compression of the input data.\nFurthermore, to enhance the sensitivity to damage, two levels of data fusion are applied to the bottleneck features using the Mahalanobis distance. In the first level, all features are\nfused into a damage index (DI) for each sensor and, in the second level, all the sensors\nare merged resulting in only one DI for each simulation. Finally, automatic damage detection is achieved by performing an outlier analysis, in which a statistical confidence limit\n(CB) is used, based on the Inverse Cumulative Gaussian Distribution Function (ICDF).\nFor feature classification, an automatic clustering process based on the k-means technique is implemented. This algorithm allows for the unsupervised and automatic classification of data, based on the calculation of statistical distances between objects. In k-means technique given a vector of data and chosen k clusters, the key is to find k centroids that minimise\nthe distance of each vector to its nearest centroid . Since it is necessary to define the number of clusters in advance, a global Silhouette index (SIL) was adopted to make\nan automatic process. At the end, the clusters will allow the classification of the two typesbetween the number of correct classifications and the total number of cases.damage detection problems, as it allows a signal to be converted from the time domain to the frequency domain, to capture the excitation frequencies induced by the wheel defects.\nIn addition, a data reduction is carried out at this stage, since the initial records contain aa crossing speed of 80 km/h. When comparing the FFT spectra for a train passage with flats, Figure 8a), with polygonal wheels, Figure 8b), there are visible differences in terms\nof amplitude peak values and excited frequency ranges. For flats, the amplitude peak values are higher and they induce frequencies in the range between DC and 1500accordance with some authors reports . In terms of severities, for flats, the more severe group (55–100 mm) is the one with the higher frequency content, as expected,a baseline response. For polygonal wheels, from the analysis of Figure 8b), it can be seen the frequency peaks for the H12–14 and H17–18 profiles around 100 and 150\nrespectively, while for the profile H6-8 a more flat spectrum is obtained without showing any significant peak. This can be explained by the irregularity level profile of thisThese two graphs can show which frequencies have higher content in the original signal.Autoencoders are artificial neural networks trained using an unsupervised approach,\nwhich aim first to learn coded representations of the data, compressing the input into\na latent space representation, and second, through this compressed information, reconstructing the information. The basic architecture of this type of network consists of threewhere **Wij**, **Wjk** are the weights connection matrices between input layer-hidden\nlayer and hidden layer-output layer, **X** = ( **X** 1, **X** 2, . . ., **Xn** ) is the input data vector,\n**H** = ( **H** 1, . . ., **Hm** ) is the low-dimensional vector and **X** [ˆ] = ( **X** [ˆ] 1, **X** [ˆ] 2, . . ., **X** [ˆ] **n** ) is the output**Figure 8.** Frequency domain responses on position 1 for the crossing speed of 80 km/h: (a) wheel flats,data vector. **b** 1, **b** 2 are bias vectors and σ 1, σ 2 are the activation function used in each of thereconstruction of the input X [ˆ], as shown in Equation (3).

After incorporating various inputs into the SSAE training, they are integrated into the so-called\n‘Input 1’. As training progresses, the data is compressed, and the main characteristics of the signals are obtained and retained in ‘Bottleneck 1’. Subsequently, these characteristics are\nused as input for training the second sparse autoencoder, which, after further compression,\nenables the extraction of the final features. Depending on the type of data under analysis,\nthe compression level differs, so multiple tests should be conducted to optimise these layer sizes. This optimisation was achieved by trial and test, changing both the size of the first\nIt should be noted that this network architecture, where the dimensions of the layers gradually decrease along the network until reaching the bottleneck layer , has proven\nto be highly robust for the type of data used. It allows for effective compression of results**Figure 9.** Schematic of the structure of the SSAE neural network used in this study.After extracting the features from the bottleneck layer of the SSAE, the difference between the healthy wheels scenarios and the damage wheels scenarios is still not sufficient. Hence\na data fusion is performed. With this fusion, it is possible to increase the sensitivity of the\nfeatures, and as a result, to obtain a damage index (DI) for each simulation. Thus, the Mahalanobis distance (MD) is used to reduce the volume of extracted data and preserve the most relevant information . Briefly, MD is a metric that measures the distance between two points in a feature space consisting of two or more variables, being independent of the\nscale of the features, thus allowing an increase in the sensitivity of the features to cases with damage. The MD, denoted here as DI, is calculated for each simulation using the followingin which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−], and ¯ x is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The MD is calculated for each sensor and for each simulation, obtaining a matrix of n distances per k number of sensors.Finally, the discrimination of the features consists in distinguishing the features as corresponding to a healthy or damaged case. At this stage of the methodology, an analysis of\nabnormal values is carried out, which will allow the condition of the train wheels to beautomatically monitored and these values to be classified into different classes. This phaseThe outlier analysis consists of grouping, by probabilistic distribution processes, the datato the previously created group. For this, a statistical confidence limit (CB) is used, based on the inverse cumulative Gaussian distribution function (ICDF), considering the mean\nvalue, ¯ μ, and standard deviation, σ, of the baseline feature vector.Whenever a value of a DI indicator is equal to or greater than CB, it is considered an outlier (the null hypothesis is rejected), thus representing a case of damage.For feature classification, a clustering process is used to divide the dataset into distinct clusters that should be as compact and separated as possible . For clustering, the k-meanson the distances of their vectors. Recent studies showed that the k-means algorithm has shown promising results . The main limitation of this technique is that it requires\nknowledge of the number of clusters in advance. For this purpose, the global silhouetteThis section presents the main results obtained through the application of the methodology proposed in section 3 to the calculated track responses. The methodology is applied using damaged wheel passages for the three simulated train speeds (60, 80 and 100 km/h),hyperparameters (presented in section 3). By adjusting these hyperparameters, it is possible to make the algorithm more efficient and improve the generalisation capabilities, as only\nthe most important features are retained. The optimisation of these hyperparameters isof data under analysis. Based on the principles of the SAE already outlined in other works\nIn the context of this study, the non-linear transfer functions (logsig) proved to be more effective than the linear ones, being the ones used in all the studied cases. After analysing Table 3, there is a similarity in the hyperparameters when comparing the two types of OOR damage. It is observed that the data compression level is the same for both cases, around\n93%, as 500 features are extracted in Bottleneck 2 from the initial input data with 7000\nConcerning the type of damage situation, the size of the ‘Bottleneck 1’ and ‘Bottleneck\n2’ was increased to bring them even closer to the initial amount of input data. This can beanalysis, making it challenging for the autoencoder to define relationships between the data, hence requiring a larger number. On the contrary, the maximum number of epochsIt is also important to emphasise that of the various hyperparameters presented, theOnce the hyperparameters have been defined, all the steps of the methodology are applied to the new dataset. For simplicity, in this section, only the last phase of the methodology will be presented, namely an outlier analysis for damage detection and cluster analysis for damage classification. For each sensor, a matrix n × m is created, where n\nis the number of test passages (baseline scenarios + damage scenarios), and m represents the number of extracted features. So, the size of the matrices is 210 × 2000 in case of the\ntype of damage, 75 × 500 for each amplitude in polygonal wheel, and 120 × 500 for wheelDespite the visual distinction between healthy and damaged wheels based on the data processing presented in subsection 3.2, unsupervised learning must use strategies capable of automatically detecting damage. To this end, an outlier analysis is employed, which consists of defining a confidence threshold using a significance level of 1% , represented**Figure 10.** Automatic OOR damage detection based on outlier analysis.by the green line in Figure 10. This approach makes it possible to successfully detect allTo distinguish the two types of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed. Figure 11\nshows a clear distinction between the damage, even when using a dataset with three different train speeds (60,80 and 100 km/h).. In the case of Figure 11a), using all four\naccelerometers, it is possible to efficiently separate the set into two large clusters, despite\n30 misclassifications (16 in the polygonisation and 14 in the flats). Even so, the accuracy\npercentage is around 85%, which is a very good result. To analyse the sensitivity to the number of sensors, only two sensors were used, one on each side ). The results\nimproved, with a decrease in the number of misclassifications from 30 to 21 (13 for polygonisation and 8 for flats). One explanation could be the disparity in sensor sensitivity to the damage, where some sensors are more sensitive than others due to their spatial positioning in relation to the damage. By merging the data from the less sensitive sensors with the\nmore sensitive ones, this could have a negative impact on the results. Thus, the percentage\nThe purpose behind presenting these two plots was to demonstrate that, whether using 4 sensors or 2 sensors, the classification remains remarkably robust, showing lowAfter identifying the type of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed once again to\nclassify the severity of each damage separately. Regarding polygonal wheels, the classification involves both amplitude and harmonic orders, leading to the clusters depicted in the obtained clusters reasonably reflect the two amplitude groups, with all misclassifications associated with the H6-8 harmonic cases (17 misclassifications). Once the amplitude\nis identified, harmonic classification must be carried out separately for each of the amplitudes. In Figure 12b), related to amplitude A1, it is observed that the obtained clusters**Figure 11.** Automatic OOR damage classification based on cluster analysis using: a) 4 sensors; b) 2are nearly perfect, with only 3 misclassifications. In Figure 12c), there are only 3 misclassifications, totalling 8 misclassifications in the classification of the number of dominant\nThe classification of harmonic order is only possible with the separation of amplitudes,\nFigure 13 presents the clusters obtained for the wheel flat cases. The separation between\nthe less severe group and baseline cases and intermediate (cluster 3) and severe cases (cluster 4) is reduced, resulting in a total of 19 misclassifications. Nevertheless, this result showsrate of about 84%. One possible reason for this significant number of misclassifications could be directly associated with the number of impacts captured by the sensor.In order to contribute to the safety of railway transportation and service quality, an automatic methodology based on machine learning has been proposed. This methodology can accurately detect and classify two types of OOR wheel damage in railway vehicles allowing to mitigate problems at both track and vehicle level, such as derailments or material\ndegradation. It includes a new technique for feature extraction based on a dedicated neural network, the Sparse Autoencoder. This non-linear technique is an upgrade concerning the commonly used linear techniques for feature extraction since it allows a better normalisation of the operational effects in the analysed data, as well as the reduction of large amounts\nof data without relying on other techniques, while keeping the most valuable information. These improvements are achieved through the use of different hyperparameters in**Figure 12.** Automatic classification of polygonal wheels based on cluster analysis: a) amplitude A1-A2;**Figure 13.** Automatic classification of wheel flats based on cluster analysis.the calculations, such as non-linear activation functions and sparsity terms. Consequently,circulation. Particularly in the railway engineering field, the inclusion of this technique\nshowed a good potential to deal with variable train speeds, essentially due to the amplifying effect on the measured track dynamic responses which could induce errors in damage The application of the methodology to the data set proved to be very successful in detecting and classifying the two types of OOR damages. Damage detection was perfect, without\nany false detection. In terms of classifying the type of damage, the results are very good,\nwith a success rate of around 85%, but if only two accelerometers are considered the successrate increases to around 90%. These results are encouraging since the range of speeds considered in the analysis, between 60 and 100 km/h, is the most representative of in-service\nfreight trains. Also, the results show that including the Sparse Autoencoder has a positive\neffect in the normalization of the train speed in the damage data set.\nRegarding the severity classification for each type of damage, the methodology proved equally successful in clustering the different damage severities. For polygonal wheels, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the severity groups in terms of defect amplitude, failing only for the H6-8 harmonic cases, and in terms of harmonic orders for each amplitude,\nwith almost perfect results. For wheel flats, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the three severity groups, though with some misclassifications between the less severe group\nand baseline cases and between intermediate and severe cases. A success rate of around 86%\nis achieved in the classification of polygonal wheel severities and 84% in the classification of wheel flat severities. Even so, these high success rates of over 80% show the robustness\nof this methodology in damage classification regardless of the train speed.on on-site measurements. Additionally, this methodology could be carried out for other types of railway vehicles, for example, passenger vehicles, since the dynamic responses are\ndifferent from freight vehicles. In that case, exploring other recent types of autoencoders,\nTo increase the complexity of the problem, the objective is to explore the concept of\nmultiple damages (same or different OOR types). For this, it will be necessary to incorporate a new stage in the methodology, the damage location stage, which will make it possible\nto distinguish isolated damage from multiple damage, as well as their respective location.\nThus, damage will be identified using cut signals, which will then be used to classify theThis work is a result of project WAY4SafeRail-WAYside monitoring system FOR SAFE RAIL transportation, with reference NORTE-01-0247-FEDER-069595, co-funded by the European Regional\nDevelopment Fund (ERDF), through the North Portugal Regional Operational Programme\nPartnership Agreement.

Within this context,\nan unsupervised methodology based on artificial intelligence techniques is presented, which allows the detection and classification of wheels, based on dynamic responses induced on the track by crossing freight railway vehicles. The methodology involves the following\nsteps: (i) data collection and pre-processing, (ii) feature extraction (iii)\ndata fusion and (iv) feature discrimination. In the first phase, an FFT\nalgorithm is applied to the acceleration track responses. Then, features are extracted after training a Stacked Sparse Autoencoder, in which the main features of the responses are obtained after a compression stage using an encoder network. This lower dimensional\nlayer forces the model to learn a compression of the input data. Then,\nwhich enhances the sensitivity to the damage recognition. Posteriorly, an outlier analysis is performed to distinguish a healthy wheelRail vehicle wheels are subjected to constant wear and tear due to continuous use and inadequate maintenance plans. Over time, this wear and tear can generate more significant defects, so it is extremely important to use sensing to understand when maintenance of both the track and rolling stock is required.

However, this type of system entail high costs envisaging the vehicle wheel condition monitoring, since sensors need to be installed in every vehicle in order to achieve a good representativity . On the other hand, wayside systems are a more viable solution for identifying wheel defects, since the condition of allThe most common wheel defects are known as OOR. As the name infers, this defect is related to deformations on the surface of the wheel circumference that make it not round.\nThis deformation can have many forms and different causes, leading to faults on the vehicle and on the track due to the higher dynamic force values [4–6]. The OOR damagesa function of their shape and size, vehicle characteristics and speed [7–10]. Wheel flats induce high dynamic impact loads on the railway infrastructure, which causes significant damage to both tracks and vehicles, such as broken axles, damaged rolling bearings and cracks in the wheels, rails and sleepers . Moreover, it also generates high vibrations\ntransmitted to the rolling stock, inducing significant stresses and causing damage to the In the case of polygonal wheels, the formation mechanism can be roughly classified\ninto three categories, namely, (1) initial wheel defects , (2) a natural vibration of the\nvehicle–track system and (3) thermoelastic instability . The formation mechanism is strongly contingent on the vehicle type and its operational characteristics, withof dominant harmonic orders [19–22]. For example, Tao et al. studied asymmetrical polygonal wear on metro wheels and obtained harmonic orders of 12–14, while another study by Tao et al. found that the most common harmonic order in Chinese freight trains is 18–19. Although a polygonal wheel could generate less impact on the track than a\nwheel flat, this defect can cause serious damage to the track due to resonance effects in the\nTo identify the occurrence of these OOR anomalies in train wheels, innovative\nmethodologies have been developed combining signal processing and automatic learning techniques. These methodologies are based on the extraction of damage sensitivity features, making possible the distinction between undamaged and damaged situations. Recently, many studies have shown good results in detecting OOR damages using\ndistinct approaches [24–29]. Mishra et al. concluded that a single FBG (Fiber Bragg Grating) sensor, positioned along the rail can detect the presence of wheel flats.\nLourenço et al. created an automatic algorithm for diagnosing OOR defects. The\nproposed methodology consists of isolating specific defective wheels and then identifying the severity of the damage, using only acceleration and strain data measured on\nthe track. In another study, Krummenacher et al. , proposed two machine-learningBy extracting the features, it is possible to transform the measured data into an alternative form of information where the correlation with damage is more easily observed. There are various techniques for feature extraction, the most common being CWT\n(continuous wavelet transform) [31–33], PCA (principal component analysis) ,detection of polygonal wheels on freight vehicles using CWT and ARX features, using\n6 accelerometers, 3 on each side of the railway track. Mosleh et al. introduced aflats by extracting AR features from acceleration records. Moreover, Mohammadi et al.\nadopted linear features, particularly, CWT, PCA, ARX and AR, and their research findingsin the context of wheel flat damage detection. Although these studies have demonstrated robust results in detection, they show some limitations in dealing with the non-linear effects associated with operational effects, such as the train speed. Due to the inability of these linear techniques to attenuate operation effects, the inclusion of different speeds\nFor most of these studies, a feature normalisation stage is used when it is necessary to remove the operational effects. Usually, latent variable methods are used, such as PCA or multiple linear regression (MLR) . Thus, to deal with the non-linear phenomena and reduce the large amounts of data without relying on the aforementioned methods,\nthe first artificial neural networks were created to inherently execute this task . Over the years, new and more advanced networks have been developed, with the Autoencoder\n(AE) being one of the main types. Later, Olshausen et al. proposed the creation of\nsparse coding and Ng et al. introduced a sparse penalisation term in the hidden layer,\nto acquire more compact and effective features from lower-dimensional data. For some datasets with complex relationships between characteristics, employing more than one SAE\nis necessary, which is why stacked sparse autoencoders (SSAE) are commonly used .\nNowadays, these types of AE are widely used in various scientific fields, but specifically\nfor structural engineering only a few studies are found, and most are about damage detection on bridges [45–47].

Pathirage et al. proposed a framework utilizing SAE’s potential for dimensionality reduction, which facilitated the assessment of damage detection performance on Many of these AE algorithms already performed feature classification in order to discriminate the different types of damages and severities. However, the AE methods can also be combined with other techniques commonly used to classify the data. They can be used unsupervised methods, in which the model is trained without any labels provided to the\ntraining dataset, such as k-means , self-organising maps (SOM) , isolation forest, gaussian mixture model , k-medoids and cluster analysis , or supervised\nmethods, which assume that the hierarchy of database categories is known, such as NaiveBayes classifiers , k-Nearest Neighbours classifiers , Support Vector Machinetwo types of OOR damages, flats and polygonal wheels, based on acceleration responses obtained from a virtual wayside monitoring system.

The application of sensors on both sides of theTo obtain the responses from the railway track, it is necessary to apply sensors on the track that can measure the dynamic responses of the crossing trains. As it is not always possible\nto install them due to the high costs involved, simulations have been carried out based on calibrated models of the track , vehicle and considering their dynamic interaction,\nas well as including the track irregularities. Simulations include cases with healthy wheelsTo simulate the dynamic interactions between the vehicle and the track, an in-house software VSI – Vehicle-Structure Interaction Analysis is used, which was initially developed by\nNeves et al. and later improved by Montenegro et al. .

Including the track irregularities directly in the constraint equations are beneficial since it avoids explicitly considering\nthem in the FEM model. Moreover, it also allows to include the wheel and OOR profiles as a periodic rail irregularity, simplifying the analysis. Thus, before starting the analysis, the\nVSI software imports track irregularities and OOR profiles from a MATLAB file, whichto the vertical and lateral irregularities in each rail in each respective position, and adds it to the constraint equations of the system throughout the dynamics analysis. Then, the\nsystem of dynamic equations is solved using the typical Newmark integration method.\nThe impact of track irregularity on wheel defect classification is significant, as a lower track quality tends to result in a higher likelihood of misclassification. A comprehensive\nexploration of this influence was previously undertaken by Mosleh et al. as documented in their research study . Hence, this study does not delve into the impact of track\nquality; rather, it primarily centres on the utilisation of AI-based methodologies for the detection and classification of wheel defects. For this, four different profiles are used, based\non European Standard EN 13848–2 . In this case, power spectral density (PSD) curvesFor OOR defects, several profiles are defined based on real measurements in representative profiles of the various severities. Subsequently, the structural matrices are imported\nMore details on track and train properties, including additional information on traintrack interaction, can be found in previous publications . Figure 1 shows the\nvehicle–track interaction model schematisation and some details about the train and track\nsubsystems, as well as the track irregularities and wheel-rail contact model.According to the conclusions reached in other studies with this type of damage ,\nthe most promising location of the sensors is on the rail. To reduce installation and maintenance costs, it is important to reduce the number of sensors without compromising the\nquality of the results. Therefore, based on a sensitivity analysis performed during the study,\nonly two vertical unidirectional accelerometers were used on each rail, 4 in total (A1 to A4),\nsince they provided a higher cost–benefit ratio. These sensors are mounted on the rail atdefects, different simulation scenarios with perfect wheels (baseline) and OOR wheels\n(damage) were defined for a five-wagon Laagrss freight train. Based on different crossing speeds, loading schemes and rail irregularities profiles, 120 baseline and 180 damage scenarios (90 for polygonal wheels and 90 for wheel flats) were defined, as summarised in For baseline scenarios, six loading schemes with five different speeds (40, 60, 80, 100\nand 120 km/h) and four rail irregularity profiles were considered, giving a total of 120 scenarios. The loading schemes used are: empty, half-loaded, full-loaded and, additionally,For the damage cases, a total of 90 scenarios were generated for polygonal wheels. These\nscenarios including 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (H1, H2 and H3) x 10 different irregularity profiles within each specified harmonic interval. In these 10 irregularity\nprofiles, based on the defect amplitude, two amplitudes are considered, five simulations for\nA1 and five simulations for A2. Similarly, 90 scenarios were created for wheel flats, involving 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (F1, F2 and F3) x 10 different irregularitywheel radius . This wave phenomenon can be characterised by the different wavelengths formed (harmonics θ ), and by the levels of irregularity ( Lw ) associated with each of the harmonics. According to Peng , it is considered a polygonal wheel when the wear amplitude assumes values above 0. mm and wavelengths between 140 mm and the wheelTo define scenarios with polygonal wheels for the Laagrss wagon, a literature survey on\nexperimental measurements in defective wheels was conducted . Three experimental irregularity profiles were collected, illustrated in Figure 3. The first group (H6-8)\ncorresponds to a study carried out by Cai et al. with dominant harmonics from 6 to 8;**Figure 3.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) of polygonal wheels with**Figure 4.** Examples of polygonal damage profiles for each of the dominant harmonic intervals.the second group (H12-14) to a study authored by Tao et al. with dominant harmonics from 12 to 14; and the third profile (H17-18) to a study performed by Wu et al. with\nBased on the wheel irregularity spectra ( Lw ) taken from the respective measurement profiles, shown in Figure 3, and considering the contribution of the first 30 harmonics, several irregularity profiles were generated, according to Figure 4.

After obtaining the acceleration measurements from the numerical simulations, an FFT algorithm is applied to the time series allowing the conversion of the signal from the time domain to the frequency domain. Then,predefined hyperparameters of the algorithm. The set hyperparameters are encoding and\ndecoding transfer functions, hidden layer size, maximum number of epochs, L2 weight regularisation term, sparsity regularisation term and a sparsity proportion term. Afterwards,**Figure 7.** Flowchart with the main phases of the methodology for detection and classification of OORthe features are extracted in the more compressed layer of the SAE, the so-called bottleneck layer. The number of features obtained is equal to the number of hidden layers which\nis usually considerably lower than the data size, allowing a compression of the input data.\nFurthermore, to enhance the sensitivity to damage, two levels of data fusion are applied to the bottleneck features using the Mahalanobis distance. In the first level, all features are\nfused into a damage index (DI) for each sensor and, in the second level, all the sensors\nare merged resulting in only one DI for each simulation. Finally, automatic damage detection is achieved by performing an outlier analysis, in which a statistical confidence limit\n(CB) is used, based on the Inverse Cumulative Gaussian Distribution Function (ICDF).\nFor feature classification, an automatic clustering process based on the k-means technique is implemented. This algorithm allows for the unsupervised and automatic classification of data, based on the calculation of statistical distances between objects. In k-means technique given a vector of data and chosen k clusters, the key is to find k centroids that minimise\nthe distance of each vector to its nearest centroid . Since it is necessary to define the number of clusters in advance, a global Silhouette index (SIL) was adopted to make\nan automatic process. At the end, the clusters will allow the classification of the two typesbetween the number of correct classifications and the total number of cases.damage detection problems, as it allows a signal to be converted from the time domain to the frequency domain, to capture the excitation frequencies induced by the wheel defects.\nIn addition, a data reduction is carried out at this stage, since the initial records contain aa crossing speed of 80 km/h. When comparing the FFT spectra for a train passage with flats, Figure 8a), with polygonal wheels, Figure 8b), there are visible differences in terms\nof amplitude peak values and excited frequency ranges. For flats, the amplitude peak values are higher and they induce frequencies in the range between DC and 1500accordance with some authors reports . In terms of severities, for flats, the more severe group (55–100 mm) is the one with the higher frequency content, as expected,a baseline response. For polygonal wheels, from the analysis of Figure 8b), it can be seen the frequency peaks for the H12–14 and H17–18 profiles around 100 and 150\nrespectively, while for the profile H6-8 a more flat spectrum is obtained without showing any significant peak. This can be explained by the irregularity level profile of thisThese two graphs can show which frequencies have higher content in the original signal.Autoencoders are artificial neural networks trained using an unsupervised approach,\nwhich aim first to learn coded representations of the data, compressing the input into\na latent space representation, and second, through this compressed information, reconstructing the information. The basic architecture of this type of network consists of threewhere **Wij**, **Wjk** are the weights connection matrices between input layer-hidden\nlayer and hidden layer-output layer, **X** = ( **X** 1, **X** 2, . . ., **Xn** ) is the input data vector,\n**H** = ( **H** 1, . . ., **Hm** ) is the low-dimensional vector and **X** [ˆ] = ( **X** [ˆ] 1, **X** [ˆ] 2, . . ., **X** [ˆ] **n** ) is the output**Figure 8.** Frequency domain responses on position 1 for the crossing speed of 80 km/h: (a) wheel flats,data vector. **b** 1, **b** 2 are bias vectors and σ 1, σ 2 are the activation function used in each of thereconstruction of the input X [ˆ], as shown in Equation (3).

After incorporating various inputs into the SSAE training, they are integrated into the so-called\n‘Input 1’. As training progresses, the data is compressed, and the main characteristics of the signals are obtained and retained in ‘Bottleneck 1’. Subsequently, these characteristics are\nused as input for training the second sparse autoencoder, which, after further compression,\nenables the extraction of the final features. Depending on the type of data under analysis,\nthe compression level differs, so multiple tests should be conducted to optimise these layer sizes. This optimisation was achieved by trial and test, changing both the size of the first\nIt should be noted that this network architecture, where the dimensions of the layers gradually decrease along the network until reaching the bottleneck layer , has proven\nto be highly robust for the type of data used. It allows for effective compression of results**Figure 9.** Schematic of the structure of the SSAE neural network used in this study.After extracting the features from the bottleneck layer of the SSAE, the difference between the healthy wheels scenarios and the damage wheels scenarios is still not sufficient. Hence\na data fusion is performed. With this fusion, it is possible to increase the sensitivity of the\nfeatures, and as a result, to obtain a damage index (DI) for each simulation. Thus, the Mahalanobis distance (MD) is used to reduce the volume of extracted data and preserve the most relevant information . Briefly, MD is a metric that measures the distance between two points in a feature space consisting of two or more variables, being independent of the\nscale of the features, thus allowing an increase in the sensitivity of the features to cases with damage. The MD, denoted here as DI, is calculated for each simulation using the followingin which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−], and ¯ x is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The MD is calculated for each sensor and for each simulation, obtaining a matrix of n distances per k number of sensors.Finally, the discrimination of the features consists in distinguishing the features as corresponding to a healthy or damaged case. At this stage of the methodology, an analysis of\nabnormal values is carried out, which will allow the condition of the train wheels to beautomatically monitored and these values to be classified into different classes. This phaseThe outlier analysis consists of grouping, by probabilistic distribution processes, the datato the previously created group. For this, a statistical confidence limit (CB) is used, based on the inverse cumulative Gaussian distribution function (ICDF), considering the mean\nvalue, ¯ μ, and standard deviation, σ, of the baseline feature vector.Whenever a value of a DI indicator is equal to or greater than CB, it is considered an outlier (the null hypothesis is rejected), thus representing a case of damage.For feature classification, a clustering process is used to divide the dataset into distinct clusters that should be as compact and separated as possible . For clustering, the k-meanson the distances of their vectors. Recent studies showed that the k-means algorithm has shown promising results . The main limitation of this technique is that it requires\nknowledge of the number of clusters in advance. For this purpose, the global silhouetteThis section presents the main results obtained through the application of the methodology proposed in section 3 to the calculated track responses. The methodology is applied using damaged wheel passages for the three simulated train speeds (60, 80 and 100 km/h),hyperparameters (presented in section 3). By adjusting these hyperparameters, it is possible to make the algorithm more efficient and improve the generalisation capabilities, as only\nthe most important features are retained. The optimisation of these hyperparameters isof data under analysis. Based on the principles of the SAE already outlined in other works\nIn the context of this study, the non-linear transfer functions (logsig) proved to be more effective than the linear ones, being the ones used in all the studied cases. After analysing Table 3, there is a similarity in the hyperparameters when comparing the two types of OOR damage. It is observed that the data compression level is the same for both cases, around\n93%, as 500 features are extracted in Bottleneck 2 from the initial input data with 7000\nConcerning the type of damage situation, the size of the ‘Bottleneck 1’ and ‘Bottleneck\n2’ was increased to bring them even closer to the initial amount of input data. This can beanalysis, making it challenging for the autoencoder to define relationships between the data, hence requiring a larger number. On the contrary, the maximum number of epochsIt is also important to emphasise that of the various hyperparameters presented, theOnce the hyperparameters have been defined, all the steps of the methodology are applied to the new dataset. For simplicity, in this section, only the last phase of the methodology will be presented, namely an outlier analysis for damage detection and cluster analysis for damage classification. For each sensor, a matrix n × m is created, where n\nis the number of test passages (baseline scenarios + damage scenarios), and m represents the number of extracted features. So, the size of the matrices is 210 × 2000 in case of the\ntype of damage, 75 × 500 for each amplitude in polygonal wheel, and 120 × 500 for wheelDespite the visual distinction between healthy and damaged wheels based on the data processing presented in subsection 3.2, unsupervised learning must use strategies capable of automatically detecting damage. To this end, an outlier analysis is employed, which consists of defining a confidence threshold using a significance level of 1% , represented**Figure 10.** Automatic OOR damage detection based on outlier analysis.by the green line in Figure 10. This approach makes it possible to successfully detect allTo distinguish the two types of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed. Figure 11\nshows a clear distinction between the damage, even when using a dataset with three different train speeds (60,80 and 100 km/h)..

The results\nimproved, with a decrease in the number of misclassifications from 30 to 21 (13 for polygonisation and 8 for flats). One explanation could be the disparity in sensor sensitivity to the damage, where some sensors are more sensitive than others due to their spatial positioning in relation to the damage. By merging the data from the less sensitive sensors with the\nmore sensitive ones, this could have a negative impact on the results. Thus, the percentage\nThe purpose behind presenting these two plots was to demonstrate that, whether using 4 sensors or 2 sensors, the classification remains remarkably robust, showing lowAfter identifying the type of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed once again to\nclassify the severity of each damage separately. Regarding polygonal wheels, the classification involves both amplitude and harmonic orders, leading to the clusters depicted in the obtained clusters reasonably reflect the two amplitude groups, with all misclassifications associated with the H6-8 harmonic cases (17 misclassifications). Once the amplitude\nis identified, harmonic classification must be carried out separately for each of the amplitudes. In Figure 12b), related to amplitude A1, it is observed that the obtained clusters**Figure 11.** Automatic OOR damage classification based on cluster analysis using: a) 4 sensors; b) 2are nearly perfect, with only 3 misclassifications. In Figure 12c), there are only 3 misclassifications, totalling 8 misclassifications in the classification of the number of dominant\nThe classification of harmonic order is only possible with the separation of amplitudes,\nFigure 13 presents the clusters obtained for the wheel flat cases. The separation between\nthe less severe group and baseline cases and intermediate (cluster 3) and severe cases (cluster 4) is reduced, resulting in a total of 19 misclassifications. Nevertheless, this result showsrate of about 84%. One possible reason for this significant number of misclassifications could be directly associated with the number of impacts captured by the sensor.In order to contribute to the safety of railway transportation and service quality, an automatic methodology based on machine learning has been proposed. This methodology can accurately detect and classify two types of OOR wheel damage in railway vehicles allowing to mitigate problems at both track and vehicle level, such as derailments or material\ndegradation. It includes a new technique for feature extraction based on a dedicated neural network, the Sparse Autoencoder. This non-linear technique is an upgrade concerning the commonly used linear techniques for feature extraction since it allows a better normalisation of the operational effects in the analysed data, as well as the reduction of large amounts\nof data without relying on other techniques, while keeping the most valuable information. These improvements are achieved through the use of different hyperparameters in**Figure 12.** Automatic classification of polygonal wheels based on cluster analysis: a) amplitude A1-A2;**Figure 13.** Automatic classification of wheel flats based on cluster analysis.the calculations, such as non-linear activation functions and sparsity terms. Consequently,circulation. Particularly in the railway engineering field, the inclusion of this technique\nshowed a good potential to deal with variable train speeds, essentially due to the amplifying effect on the measured track dynamic responses which could induce errors in damage The application of the methodology to the data set proved to be very successful in detecting and classifying the two types of OOR damages. Damage detection was perfect, without\nany false detection. In terms of classifying the type of damage, the results are very good,\nwith a success rate of around 85%, but if only two accelerometers are considered the successrate increases to around 90%. These results are encouraging since the range of speeds considered in the analysis, between 60 and 100 km/h, is the most representative of in-service\nfreight trains. Also, the results show that including the Sparse Autoencoder has a positive\neffect in the normalization of the train speed in the damage data set.\nRegarding the severity classification for each type of damage, the methodology proved equally successful in clustering the different damage severities. For polygonal wheels, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the severity groups in terms of defect amplitude, failing only for the H6-8 harmonic cases, and in terms of harmonic orders for each amplitude,\nwith almost perfect results. For wheel flats, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the three severity groups, though with some misclassifications between the less severe group\nand baseline cases and between intermediate and severe cases. A success rate of around 86%\nis achieved in the classification of polygonal wheel severities and 84% in the classification of wheel flat severities. Even so, these high success rates of over 80% show the robustness\nof this methodology in damage classification regardless of the train speed.on on-site measurements. Additionally, this methodology could be carried out for other types of railway vehicles, for example, passenger vehicles, since the dynamic responses are\ndifferent from freight vehicles. In that case, exploring other recent types of autoencoders,\nTo increase the complexity of the problem, the objective is to explore the concept of\nmultiple damages (same or different OOR types). For this, it will be necessary to incorporate a new stage in the methodology, the damage location stage, which will make it possible\nto distinguish isolated damage from multiple damage, as well as their respective location.\nThus, damage will be identified using cut signals, which will then be used to classify theThis work is a result of project WAY4SafeRail-WAYside monitoring system FOR SAFE RAIL transportation, with reference NORTE-01-0247-FEDER-069595, co-funded by the European Regional\nDevelopment Fund (ERDF), through the North Portugal Regional Operational Programme\nPartnership Agreement.

Within this context,\nan unsupervised methodology based on artificial intelligence techniques is presented, which allows the detection and classification of wheels, based on dynamic responses induced on the track by crossing freight railway vehicles. The methodology involves the following\nsteps: (i) data collection and pre-processing, (ii) feature extraction (iii)\ndata fusion and (iv) feature discrimination. In the first phase, an FFT\nalgorithm is applied to the acceleration track responses. Then, features are extracted after training a Stacked Sparse Autoencoder, in which the main features of the responses are obtained after a compression stage using an encoder network. This lower dimensional\nlayer forces the model to learn a compression of the input data. Then,\nwhich enhances the sensitivity to the damage recognition. Posteriorly, an outlier analysis is performed to distinguish a healthy wheelRail vehicle wheels are subjected to constant wear and tear due to continuous use and inadequate maintenance plans. Over time, this wear and tear can generate more significant defects, so it is extremely important to use sensing to understand when maintenance of both the track and rolling stock is required.

However, this type of system entail high costs envisaging the vehicle wheel condition monitoring, since sensors need to be installed in every vehicle in order to achieve a good representativity . On the other hand, wayside systems are a more viable solution for identifying wheel defects, since the condition of allThe most common wheel defects are known as OOR. As the name infers, this defect is related to deformations on the surface of the wheel circumference that make it not round.\nThis deformation can have many forms and different causes, leading to faults on the vehicle and on the track due to the higher dynamic force values [4–6]. The OOR damagesa function of their shape and size, vehicle characteristics and speed [7–10]. Wheel flats induce high dynamic impact loads on the railway infrastructure, which causes significant damage to both tracks and vehicles, such as broken axles, damaged rolling bearings and cracks in the wheels, rails and sleepers . Moreover, it also generates high vibrations\ntransmitted to the rolling stock, inducing significant stresses and causing damage to the In the case of polygonal wheels, the formation mechanism can be roughly classified\ninto three categories, namely, (1) initial wheel defects , (2) a natural vibration of the\nvehicle–track system and (3) thermoelastic instability . The formation mechanism is strongly contingent on the vehicle type and its operational characteristics, withof dominant harmonic orders [19–22]. For example, Tao et al. studied asymmetrical polygonal wear on metro wheels and obtained harmonic orders of 12–14, while another study by Tao et al. found that the most common harmonic order in Chinese freight trains is 18–19. Although a polygonal wheel could generate less impact on the track than a\nwheel flat, this defect can cause serious damage to the track due to resonance effects in the\nTo identify the occurrence of these OOR anomalies in train wheels, innovative\nmethodologies have been developed combining signal processing and automatic learning techniques. These methodologies are based on the extraction of damage sensitivity features, making possible the distinction between undamaged and damaged situations. Recently, many studies have shown good results in detecting OOR damages using\ndistinct approaches [24–29]. Mishra et al. concluded that a single FBG (Fiber Bragg Grating) sensor, positioned along the rail can detect the presence of wheel flats.\nLourenço et al. created an automatic algorithm for diagnosing OOR defects. The\nproposed methodology consists of isolating specific defective wheels and then identifying the severity of the damage, using only acceleration and strain data measured on\nthe track. In another study, Krummenacher et al. , proposed two machine-learningBy extracting the features, it is possible to transform the measured data into an alternative form of information where the correlation with damage is more easily observed. There are various techniques for feature extraction, the most common being CWT\n(continuous wavelet transform) [31–33], PCA (principal component analysis) ,detection of polygonal wheels on freight vehicles using CWT and ARX features, using\n6 accelerometers, 3 on each side of the railway track. Mosleh et al. introduced aflats by extracting AR features from acceleration records. Moreover, Mohammadi et al.\nadopted linear features, particularly, CWT, PCA, ARX and AR, and their research findingsin the context of wheel flat damage detection. Although these studies have demonstrated robust results in detection, they show some limitations in dealing with the non-linear effects associated with operational effects, such as the train speed. Due to the inability of these linear techniques to attenuate operation effects, the inclusion of different speeds\nFor most of these studies, a feature normalisation stage is used when it is necessary to remove the operational effects. Usually, latent variable methods are used, such as PCA or multiple linear regression (MLR) . Thus, to deal with the non-linear phenomena and reduce the large amounts of data without relying on the aforementioned methods,\nthe first artificial neural networks were created to inherently execute this task . Over the years, new and more advanced networks have been developed, with the Autoencoder\n(AE) being one of the main types. Later, Olshausen et al. proposed the creation of\nsparse coding and Ng et al. introduced a sparse penalisation term in the hidden layer,\nto acquire more compact and effective features from lower-dimensional data. For some datasets with complex relationships between characteristics, employing more than one SAE\nis necessary, which is why stacked sparse autoencoders (SSAE) are commonly used .\nNowadays, these types of AE are widely used in various scientific fields, but specifically\nfor structural engineering only a few studies are found, and most are about damage detection on bridges [45–47].

However, the AE methods can also be combined with other techniques commonly used to classify the data. They can be used unsupervised methods, in which the model is trained without any labels provided to the\ntraining dataset, such as k-means , self-organising maps (SOM) , isolation forest, gaussian mixture model , k-medoids and cluster analysis , or supervised\nmethods, which assume that the hierarchy of database categories is known, such as NaiveBayes classifiers , k-Nearest Neighbours classifiers , Support Vector Machinetwo types of OOR damages, flats and polygonal wheels, based on acceleration responses obtained from a virtual wayside monitoring system.

The application of sensors on both sides of theTo obtain the responses from the railway track, it is necessary to apply sensors on the track that can measure the dynamic responses of the crossing trains. As it is not always possible\nto install them due to the high costs involved, simulations have been carried out based on calibrated models of the track , vehicle and considering their dynamic interaction,\nas well as including the track irregularities. Simulations include cases with healthy wheelsTo simulate the dynamic interactions between the vehicle and the track, an in-house software VSI – Vehicle-Structure Interaction Analysis is used, which was initially developed by\nNeves et al. and later improved by Montenegro et al. .

Including the track irregularities directly in the constraint equations are beneficial since it avoids explicitly considering\nthem in the FEM model. Moreover, it also allows to include the wheel and OOR profiles as a periodic rail irregularity, simplifying the analysis. Thus, before starting the analysis, the\nVSI software imports track irregularities and OOR profiles from a MATLAB file, whichto the vertical and lateral irregularities in each rail in each respective position, and adds it to the constraint equations of the system throughout the dynamics analysis. Then, the\nsystem of dynamic equations is solved using the typical Newmark integration method.\nThe impact of track irregularity on wheel defect classification is significant, as a lower track quality tends to result in a higher likelihood of misclassification. A comprehensive\nexploration of this influence was previously undertaken by Mosleh et al. as documented in their research study . Hence, this study does not delve into the impact of track\nquality; rather, it primarily centres on the utilisation of AI-based methodologies for the detection and classification of wheel defects. For this, four different profiles are used, based\non European Standard EN 13848–2 . In this case, power spectral density (PSD) curvesFor OOR defects, several profiles are defined based on real measurements in representative profiles of the various severities. Subsequently, the structural matrices are imported\nMore details on track and train properties, including additional information on traintrack interaction, can be found in previous publications . Figure 1 shows the\nvehicle–track interaction model schematisation and some details about the train and track\nsubsystems, as well as the track irregularities and wheel-rail contact model.According to the conclusions reached in other studies with this type of damage ,\nthe most promising location of the sensors is on the rail. To reduce installation and maintenance costs, it is important to reduce the number of sensors without compromising the\nquality of the results. Therefore, based on a sensitivity analysis performed during the study,\nonly two vertical unidirectional accelerometers were used on each rail, 4 in total (A1 to A4),\nsince they provided a higher cost–benefit ratio. These sensors are mounted on the rail atdefects, different simulation scenarios with perfect wheels (baseline) and OOR wheels\n(damage) were defined for a five-wagon Laagrss freight train. Based on different crossing speeds, loading schemes and rail irregularities profiles, 120 baseline and 180 damage scenarios (90 for polygonal wheels and 90 for wheel flats) were defined, as summarised in For baseline scenarios, six loading schemes with five different speeds (40, 60, 80, 100\nand 120 km/h) and four rail irregularity profiles were considered, giving a total of 120 scenarios. The loading schemes used are: empty, half-loaded, full-loaded and, additionally,For the damage cases, a total of 90 scenarios were generated for polygonal wheels. These\nscenarios including 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (H1, H2 and H3) x 10 different irregularity profiles within each specified harmonic interval. In these 10 irregularity\nprofiles, based on the defect amplitude, two amplitudes are considered, five simulations for\nA1 and five simulations for A2. Similarly, 90 scenarios were created for wheel flats, involving 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (F1, F2 and F3) x 10 different irregularitywheel radius . This wave phenomenon can be characterised by the different wavelengths formed (harmonics θ ), and by the levels of irregularity ( Lw ) associated with each of the harmonics.

The number of features obtained is equal to the number of hidden layers which\nis usually considerably lower than the data size, allowing a compression of the input data.\nFurthermore, to enhance the sensitivity to damage, two levels of data fusion are applied to the bottleneck features using the Mahalanobis distance. In the first level, all features are\nfused into a damage index (DI) for each sensor and, in the second level, all the sensors\nare merged resulting in only one DI for each simulation. Finally, automatic damage detection is achieved by performing an outlier analysis, in which a statistical confidence limit\n(CB) is used, based on the Inverse Cumulative Gaussian Distribution Function (ICDF).\nFor feature classification, an automatic clustering process based on the k-means technique is implemented. This algorithm allows for the unsupervised and automatic classification of data, based on the calculation of statistical distances between objects. In k-means technique given a vector of data and chosen k clusters, the key is to find k centroids that minimise\nthe distance of each vector to its nearest centroid . Since it is necessary to define the number of clusters in advance, a global Silhouette index (SIL) was adopted to make\nan automatic process. At the end, the clusters will allow the classification of the two typesbetween the number of correct classifications and the total number of cases.damage detection problems, as it allows a signal to be converted from the time domain to the frequency domain, to capture the excitation frequencies induced by the wheel defects.\nIn addition, a data reduction is carried out at this stage, since the initial records contain aa crossing speed of 80 km/h. When comparing the FFT spectra for a train passage with flats, Figure 8a), with polygonal wheels, Figure 8b), there are visible differences in terms\nof amplitude peak values and excited frequency ranges. For flats, the amplitude peak values are higher and they induce frequencies in the range between DC and 1500accordance with some authors reports . In terms of severities, for flats, the more severe group (55–100 mm) is the one with the higher frequency content, as expected,a baseline response. For polygonal wheels, from the analysis of Figure 8b), it can be seen the frequency peaks for the H12–14 and H17–18 profiles around 100 and 150\nrespectively, while for the profile H6-8 a more flat spectrum is obtained without showing any significant peak. This can be explained by the irregularity level profile of thisThese two graphs can show which frequencies have higher content in the original signal.Autoencoders are artificial neural networks trained using an unsupervised approach,\nwhich aim first to learn coded representations of the data, compressing the input into\na latent space representation, and second, through this compressed information, reconstructing the information. The basic architecture of this type of network consists of threewhere **Wij**, **Wjk** are the weights connection matrices between input layer-hidden\nlayer and hidden layer-output layer, **X** = ( **X** 1, **X** 2, . . ., **Xn** ) is the input data vector,\n**H** = ( **H** 1, . . ., **Hm** ) is the low-dimensional vector and **X** [ˆ] = ( **X** [ˆ] 1, **X** [ˆ] 2, . . ., **X** [ˆ] **n** ) is the output**Figure 8.** Frequency domain responses on position 1 for the crossing speed of 80 km/h: (a) wheel flats,data vector. **b** 1, **b** 2 are bias vectors and σ 1, σ 2 are the activation function used in each of thereconstruction of the input X [ˆ], as shown in Equation (3). This function uses the meanIn the Sparse Autoencoder, to make the coding more efficient, two regularisation terms,\nsparse penalty term and weight regularisation term, are added to the error function, causing only a subset of neurons to be activated. The average activation of neurons in the hiddenAs the average activation ˆ ρ is intended to be close to a constant ρ (sparsity proportion)\nand it is usually a small positive number near 0, the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence isIn addition to this, a weight regularisation term, called L2 regularisation, is also addedwhere L is the number of hidden layers, nl the output size of layer l, kl the input size ofwhere μ is the coefficient for the L2 regularisation term and β the coefficient for the sparsityAfter data pre-processing, the acceleration responses in the frequency domain, are then In this work, two layers of SAE’s were used to form the network, as shown in Figure 9.layers, with the outputs of the previous autoencoder serving as input for the next one. After incorporating various inputs into the SSAE training, they are integrated into the so-called\n‘Input 1’. As training progresses, the data is compressed, and the main characteristics of the signals are obtained and retained in ‘Bottleneck 1’. Subsequently, these characteristics are\nused as input for training the second sparse autoencoder, which, after further compression,\nenables the extraction of the final features. Depending on the type of data under analysis,\nthe compression level differs, so multiple tests should be conducted to optimise these layer sizes. This optimisation was achieved by trial and test, changing both the size of the first\nIt should be noted that this network architecture, where the dimensions of the layers gradually decrease along the network until reaching the bottleneck layer , has proven\nto be highly robust for the type of data used. It allows for effective compression of results**Figure 9.** Schematic of the structure of the SSAE neural network used in this study.After extracting the features from the bottleneck layer of the SSAE, the difference between the healthy wheels scenarios and the damage wheels scenarios is still not sufficient. Hence\na data fusion is performed. With this fusion, it is possible to increase the sensitivity of the\nfeatures, and as a result, to obtain a damage index (DI) for each simulation. Thus, the Mahalanobis distance (MD) is used to reduce the volume of extracted data and preserve the most relevant information . Briefly, MD is a metric that measures the distance between two points in a feature space consisting of two or more variables, being independent of the\nscale of the features, thus allowing an increase in the sensitivity of the features to cases with damage. The MD, denoted here as DI, is calculated for each simulation using the followingin which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−], and ¯ x is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The MD is calculated for each sensor and for each simulation, obtaining a matrix of n distances per k number of sensors.Finally, the discrimination of the features consists in distinguishing the features as corresponding to a healthy or damaged case. At this stage of the methodology, an analysis of\nabnormal values is carried out, which will allow the condition of the train wheels to beautomatically monitored and these values to be classified into different classes. This phaseThe outlier analysis consists of grouping, by probabilistic distribution processes, the datato the previously created group. For this, a statistical confidence limit (CB) is used, based on the inverse cumulative Gaussian distribution function (ICDF), considering the mean\nvalue, ¯ μ, and standard deviation, σ, of the baseline feature vector.Whenever a value of a DI indicator is equal to or greater than CB, it is considered an outlier (the null hypothesis is rejected), thus representing a case of damage.For feature classification, a clustering process is used to divide the dataset into distinct clusters that should be as compact and separated as possible . For clustering, the k-meanson the distances of their vectors. Recent studies showed that the k-means algorithm has shown promising results . The main limitation of this technique is that it requires\nknowledge of the number of clusters in advance. For this purpose, the global silhouetteThis section presents the main results obtained through the application of the methodology proposed in section 3 to the calculated track responses. The methodology is applied using damaged wheel passages for the three simulated train speeds (60, 80 and 100 km/h),hyperparameters (presented in section 3). By adjusting these hyperparameters, it is possible to make the algorithm more efficient and improve the generalisation capabilities, as only\nthe most important features are retained. The optimisation of these hyperparameters isof data under analysis. Based on the principles of the SAE already outlined in other works\nIn the context of this study, the non-linear transfer functions (logsig) proved to be more effective than the linear ones, being the ones used in all the studied cases. After analysing Table 3, there is a similarity in the hyperparameters when comparing the two types of OOR damage. It is observed that the data compression level is the same for both cases, around\n93%, as 500 features are extracted in Bottleneck 2 from the initial input data with 7000\nConcerning the type of damage situation, the size of the ‘Bottleneck 1’ and ‘Bottleneck\n2’ was increased to bring them even closer to the initial amount of input data. This can beanalysis, making it challenging for the autoencoder to define relationships between the data, hence requiring a larger number. On the contrary, the maximum number of epochsIt is also important to emphasise that of the various hyperparameters presented, theOnce the hyperparameters have been defined, all the steps of the methodology are applied to the new dataset. For simplicity, in this section, only the last phase of the methodology will be presented, namely an outlier analysis for damage detection and cluster analysis for damage classification. For each sensor, a matrix n × m is created, where n\nis the number of test passages (baseline scenarios + damage scenarios), and m represents the number of extracted features. So, the size of the matrices is 210 × 2000 in case of the\ntype of damage, 75 × 500 for each amplitude in polygonal wheel, and 120 × 500 for wheelDespite the visual distinction between healthy and damaged wheels based on the data processing presented in subsection 3.2, unsupervised learning must use strategies capable of automatically detecting damage. To this end, an outlier analysis is employed, which consists of defining a confidence threshold using a significance level of 1% , represented**Figure 10.** Automatic OOR damage detection based on outlier analysis.by the green line in Figure 10. This approach makes it possible to successfully detect allTo distinguish the two types of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed. Figure 11\nshows a clear distinction between the damage, even when using a dataset with three different train speeds (60,80 and 100 km/h).. In the case of Figure 11a), using all four\naccelerometers, it is possible to efficiently separate the set into two large clusters, despite\n30 misclassifications (16 in the polygonisation and 14 in the flats). Even so, the accuracy\npercentage is around 85%, which is a very good result. To analyse the sensitivity to the number of sensors, only two sensors were used, one on each side ). The results\nimproved, with a decrease in the number of misclassifications from 30 to 21 (13 for polygonisation and 8 for flats). One explanation could be the disparity in sensor sensitivity to the damage, where some sensors are more sensitive than others due to their spatial positioning in relation to the damage. By merging the data from the less sensitive sensors with the\nmore sensitive ones, this could have a negative impact on the results. Thus, the percentage\nThe purpose behind presenting these two plots was to demonstrate that, whether using 4 sensors or 2 sensors, the classification remains remarkably robust, showing lowAfter identifying the type of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed once again to\nclassify the severity of each damage separately. Regarding polygonal wheels, the classification involves both amplitude and harmonic orders, leading to the clusters depicted in the obtained clusters reasonably reflect the two amplitude groups, with all misclassifications associated with the H6-8 harmonic cases (17 misclassifications). Once the amplitude\nis identified, harmonic classification must be carried out separately for each of the amplitudes. In Figure 12b), related to amplitude A1, it is observed that the obtained clusters**Figure 11.** Automatic OOR damage classification based on cluster analysis using: a) 4 sensors; b) 2are nearly perfect, with only 3 misclassifications. In Figure 12c), there are only 3 misclassifications, totalling 8 misclassifications in the classification of the number of dominant\nThe classification of harmonic order is only possible with the separation of amplitudes,\nFigure 13 presents the clusters obtained for the wheel flat cases. The separation between\nthe less severe group and baseline cases and intermediate (cluster 3) and severe cases (cluster 4) is reduced, resulting in a total of 19 misclassifications. Nevertheless, this result showsrate of about 84%. One possible reason for this significant number of misclassifications could be directly associated with the number of impacts captured by the sensor.In order to contribute to the safety of railway transportation and service quality, an automatic methodology based on machine learning has been proposed. This methodology can accurately detect and classify two types of OOR wheel damage in railway vehicles allowing to mitigate problems at both track and vehicle level, such as derailments or material\ndegradation. It includes a new technique for feature extraction based on a dedicated neural network, the Sparse Autoencoder. This non-linear technique is an upgrade concerning the commonly used linear techniques for feature extraction since it allows a better normalisation of the operational effects in the analysed data, as well as the reduction of large amounts\nof data without relying on other techniques, while keeping the most valuable information. These improvements are achieved through the use of different hyperparameters in**Figure 12.** Automatic classification of polygonal wheels based on cluster analysis: a) amplitude A1-A2;**Figure 13.** Automatic classification of wheel flats based on cluster analysis.the calculations, such as non-linear activation functions and sparsity terms. Consequently,circulation. Particularly in the railway engineering field, the inclusion of this technique\nshowed a good potential to deal with variable train speeds, essentially due to the amplifying effect on the measured track dynamic responses which could induce errors in damage The application of the methodology to the data set proved to be very successful in detecting and classifying the two types of OOR damages. Damage detection was perfect, without\nany false detection. In terms of classifying the type of damage, the results are very good,\nwith a success rate of around 85%, but if only two accelerometers are considered the successrate increases to around 90%. These results are encouraging since the range of speeds considered in the analysis, between 60 and 100 km/h, is the most representative of in-service\nfreight trains. Also, the results show that including the Sparse Autoencoder has a positive\neffect in the normalization of the train speed in the damage data set.\nRegarding the severity classification for each type of damage, the methodology proved equally successful in clustering the different damage severities. For polygonal wheels, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the severity groups in terms of defect amplitude, failing only for the H6-8 harmonic cases, and in terms of harmonic orders for each amplitude,\nwith almost perfect results. For wheel flats, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the three severity groups, though with some misclassifications between the less severe group\nand baseline cases and between intermediate and severe cases. A success rate of around 86%\nis achieved in the classification of polygonal wheel severities and 84% in the classification of wheel flat severities. Even so, these high success rates of over 80% show the robustness\nof this methodology in damage classification regardless of the train speed.on on-site measurements. Additionally, this methodology could be carried out for other types of railway vehicles, for example, passenger vehicles, since the dynamic responses are\ndifferent from freight vehicles. In that case, exploring other recent types of autoencoders,\nTo increase the complexity of the problem, the objective is to explore the concept of\nmultiple damages (same or different OOR types). For this, it will be necessary to incorporate a new stage in the methodology, the damage location stage, which will make it possible\nto distinguish isolated damage from multiple damage, as well as their respective location.\nThus, damage will be identified using cut signals, which will then be used to classify theThis work is a result of project WAY4SafeRail-WAYside monitoring system FOR SAFE RAIL transportation, with reference NORTE-01-0247-FEDER-069595, co-funded by the European Regional\nDevelopment Fund (ERDF), through the North Portugal Regional Operational Programme\nPartnership Agreement.

However, this type of system entail high costs envisaging the vehicle wheel condition monitoring, since sensors need to be installed in every vehicle in order to achieve a good representativity . On the other hand, wayside systems are a more viable solution for identifying wheel defects, since the condition of allThe most common wheel defects are known as OOR. As the name infers, this defect is related to deformations on the surface of the wheel circumference that make it not round.\nThis deformation can have many forms and different causes, leading to faults on the vehicle and on the track due to the higher dynamic force values [4–6]. The OOR damagesa function of their shape and size, vehicle characteristics and speed [7–10]. Wheel flats induce high dynamic impact loads on the railway infrastructure, which causes significant damage to both tracks and vehicles, such as broken axles, damaged rolling bearings and cracks in the wheels, rails and sleepers . Moreover, it also generates high vibrations\ntransmitted to the rolling stock, inducing significant stresses and causing damage to the In the case of polygonal wheels, the formation mechanism can be roughly classified\ninto three categories, namely, (1) initial wheel defects , (2) a natural vibration of the\nvehicle–track system and (3) thermoelastic instability . The formation mechanism is strongly contingent on the vehicle type and its operational characteristics, withof dominant harmonic orders [19–22]. For example, Tao et al. studied asymmetrical polygonal wear on metro wheels and obtained harmonic orders of 12–14, while another study by Tao et al. found that the most common harmonic order in Chinese freight trains is 18–19. Although a polygonal wheel could generate less impact on the track than a\nwheel flat, this defect can cause serious damage to the track due to resonance effects in the\nTo identify the occurrence of these OOR anomalies in train wheels, innovative\nmethodologies have been developed combining signal processing and automatic learning techniques. These methodologies are based on the extraction of damage sensitivity features, making possible the distinction between undamaged and damaged situations. Recently, many studies have shown good results in detecting OOR damages using\ndistinct approaches [24–29]. Mishra et al. concluded that a single FBG (Fiber Bragg Grating) sensor, positioned along the rail can detect the presence of wheel flats.\nLourenço et al. created an automatic algorithm for diagnosing OOR defects. The\nproposed methodology consists of isolating specific defective wheels and then identifying the severity of the damage, using only acceleration and strain data measured on\nthe track. In another study, Krummenacher et al. , proposed two machine-learningBy extracting the features, it is possible to transform the measured data into an alternative form of information where the correlation with damage is more easily observed. There are various techniques for feature extraction, the most common being CWT\n(continuous wavelet transform) [31–33], PCA (principal component analysis) ,detection of polygonal wheels on freight vehicles using CWT and ARX features, using\n6 accelerometers, 3 on each side of the railway track. Mosleh et al. introduced aflats by extracting AR features from acceleration records. Moreover, Mohammadi et al.\nadopted linear features, particularly, CWT, PCA, ARX and AR, and their research findingsin the context of wheel flat damage detection. Although these studies have demonstrated robust results in detection, they show some limitations in dealing with the non-linear effects associated with operational effects, such as the train speed. Due to the inability of these linear techniques to attenuate operation effects, the inclusion of different speeds\nFor most of these studies, a feature normalisation stage is used when it is necessary to remove the operational effects. Usually, latent variable methods are used, such as PCA or multiple linear regression (MLR) . Thus, to deal with the non-linear phenomena and reduce the large amounts of data without relying on the aforementioned methods,\nthe first artificial neural networks were created to inherently execute this task . Over the years, new and more advanced networks have been developed, with the Autoencoder\n(AE) being one of the main types.

The application of sensors on both sides of theTo obtain the responses from the railway track, it is necessary to apply sensors on the track that can measure the dynamic responses of the crossing trains. As it is not always possible\nto install them due to the high costs involved, simulations have been carried out based on calibrated models of the track , vehicle and considering their dynamic interaction,\nas well as including the track irregularities.

Including the track irregularities directly in the constraint equations are beneficial since it avoids explicitly considering\nthem in the FEM model. Moreover, it also allows to include the wheel and OOR profiles as a periodic rail irregularity, simplifying the analysis. Thus, before starting the analysis, the\nVSI software imports track irregularities and OOR profiles from a MATLAB file, whichto the vertical and lateral irregularities in each rail in each respective position, and adds it to the constraint equations of the system throughout the dynamics analysis. Then, the\nsystem of dynamic equations is solved using the typical Newmark integration method.\nThe impact of track irregularity on wheel defect classification is significant, as a lower track quality tends to result in a higher likelihood of misclassification. A comprehensive\nexploration of this influence was previously undertaken by Mosleh et al. as documented in their research study . Hence, this study does not delve into the impact of track\nquality; rather, it primarily centres on the utilisation of AI-based methodologies for the detection and classification of wheel defects. For this, four different profiles are used, based\non European Standard EN 13848–2 . In this case, power spectral density (PSD) curvesFor OOR defects, several profiles are defined based on real measurements in representative profiles of the various severities. Subsequently, the structural matrices are imported\nMore details on track and train properties, including additional information on traintrack interaction, can be found in previous publications . Figure 1 shows the\nvehicle–track interaction model schematisation and some details about the train and track\nsubsystems, as well as the track irregularities and wheel-rail contact model.According to the conclusions reached in other studies with this type of damage ,\nthe most promising location of the sensors is on the rail. To reduce installation and maintenance costs, it is important to reduce the number of sensors without compromising the\nquality of the results. Therefore, based on a sensitivity analysis performed during the study,\nonly two vertical unidirectional accelerometers were used on each rail, 4 in total (A1 to A4),\nsince they provided a higher cost–benefit ratio. These sensors are mounted on the rail atdefects, different simulation scenarios with perfect wheels (baseline) and OOR wheels\n(damage) were defined for a five-wagon Laagrss freight train. Based on different crossing speeds, loading schemes and rail irregularities profiles, 120 baseline and 180 damage scenarios (90 for polygonal wheels and 90 for wheel flats) were defined, as summarised in For baseline scenarios, six loading schemes with five different speeds (40, 60, 80, 100\nand 120 km/h) and four rail irregularity profiles were considered, giving a total of 120 scenarios. The loading schemes used are: empty, half-loaded, full-loaded and, additionally,For the damage cases, a total of 90 scenarios were generated for polygonal wheels. These\nscenarios including 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (H1, H2 and H3) x 10 different irregularity profiles within each specified harmonic interval. In these 10 irregularity\nprofiles, based on the defect amplitude, two amplitudes are considered, five simulations for\nA1 and five simulations for A2. Similarly, 90 scenarios were created for wheel flats, involving 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (F1, F2 and F3) x 10 different irregularitywheel radius . This wave phenomenon can be characterised by the different wavelengths formed (harmonics θ ), and by the levels of irregularity ( Lw ) associated with each of the harmonics. According to Peng , it is considered a polygonal wheel when the wear amplitude assumes values above 0. mm and wavelengths between 140 mm and the wheelTo define scenarios with polygonal wheels for the Laagrss wagon, a literature survey on\nexperimental measurements in defective wheels was conducted . Three experimental irregularity profiles were collected, illustrated in Figure 3. The first group (H6-8)\ncorresponds to a study carried out by Cai et al. with dominant harmonics from 6 to 8;**Figure 3.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) of polygonal wheels with**Figure 4.** Examples of polygonal damage profiles for each of the dominant harmonic intervals.the second group (H12-14) to a study authored by Tao et al. with dominant harmonics from 12 to 14; and the third profile (H17-18) to a study performed by Wu et al. with\nBased on the wheel irregularity spectra ( Lw ) taken from the respective measurement profiles, shown in Figure 3, and considering the contribution of the first 30 harmonics, several irregularity profiles were generated, according to Figure 4.

Then,predefined hyperparameters of the algorithm. The set hyperparameters are encoding and\ndecoding transfer functions, hidden layer size, maximum number of epochs, L2 weight regularisation term, sparsity regularisation term and a sparsity proportion term. Afterwards,**Figure 7.** Flowchart with the main phases of the methodology for detection and classification of OORthe features are extracted in the more compressed layer of the SAE, the so-called bottleneck layer. The number of features obtained is equal to the number of hidden layers which\nis usually considerably lower than the data size, allowing a compression of the input data.\nFurthermore, to enhance the sensitivity to damage, two levels of data fusion are applied to the bottleneck features using the Mahalanobis distance. In the first level, all features are\nfused into a damage index (DI) for each sensor and, in the second level, all the sensors\nare merged resulting in only one DI for each simulation. Finally, automatic damage detection is achieved by performing an outlier analysis, in which a statistical confidence limit\n(CB) is used, based on the Inverse Cumulative Gaussian Distribution Function (ICDF).\nFor feature classification, an automatic clustering process based on the k-means technique is implemented. This algorithm allows for the unsupervised and automatic classification of data, based on the calculation of statistical distances between objects. In k-means technique given a vector of data and chosen k clusters, the key is to find k centroids that minimise\nthe distance of each vector to its nearest centroid . Since it is necessary to define the number of clusters in advance, a global Silhouette index (SIL) was adopted to make\nan automatic process. At the end, the clusters will allow the classification of the two typesbetween the number of correct classifications and the total number of cases.damage detection problems, as it allows a signal to be converted from the time domain to the frequency domain, to capture the excitation frequencies induced by the wheel defects.\nIn addition, a data reduction is carried out at this stage, since the initial records contain aa crossing speed of 80 km/h. When comparing the FFT spectra for a train passage with flats, Figure 8a), with polygonal wheels, Figure 8b), there are visible differences in terms\nof amplitude peak values and excited frequency ranges. For flats, the amplitude peak values are higher and they induce frequencies in the range between DC and 1500accordance with some authors reports . In terms of severities, for flats, the more severe group (55–100 mm) is the one with the higher frequency content, as expected,a baseline response. For polygonal wheels, from the analysis of Figure 8b), it can be seen the frequency peaks for the H12–14 and H17–18 profiles around 100 and 150\nrespectively, while for the profile H6-8 a more flat spectrum is obtained without showing any significant peak. This can be explained by the irregularity level profile of thisThese two graphs can show which frequencies have higher content in the original signal.Autoencoders are artificial neural networks trained using an unsupervised approach,\nwhich aim first to learn coded representations of the data, compressing the input into\na latent space representation, and second, through this compressed information, reconstructing the information. The basic architecture of this type of network consists of threewhere **Wij**, **Wjk** are the weights connection matrices between input layer-hidden\nlayer and hidden layer-output layer, **X** = ( **X** 1, **X** 2, . . ., **Xn** ) is the input data vector,\n**H** = ( **H** 1, . . ., **Hm** ) is the low-dimensional vector and **X** [ˆ] = ( **X** [ˆ] 1, **X** [ˆ] 2, . . ., **X** [ˆ] **n** ) is the output**Figure 8.** Frequency domain responses on position 1 for the crossing speed of 80 km/h: (a) wheel flats,data vector. **b** 1, **b** 2 are bias vectors and σ 1, σ 2 are the activation function used in each of thereconstruction of the input X [ˆ], as shown in Equation (3).

After incorporating various inputs into the SSAE training, they are integrated into the so-called\n‘Input 1’. As training progresses, the data is compressed, and the main characteristics of the signals are obtained and retained in ‘Bottleneck 1’. Subsequently, these characteristics are\nused as input for training the second sparse autoencoder, which, after further compression,\nenables the extraction of the final features. Depending on the type of data under analysis,\nthe compression level differs, so multiple tests should be conducted to optimise these layer sizes. This optimisation was achieved by trial and test, changing both the size of the first\nIt should be noted that this network architecture, where the dimensions of the layers gradually decrease along the network until reaching the bottleneck layer , has proven\nto be highly robust for the type of data used. It allows for effective compression of results**Figure 9.** Schematic of the structure of the SSAE neural network used in this study.After extracting the features from the bottleneck layer of the SSAE, the difference between the healthy wheels scenarios and the damage wheels scenarios is still not sufficient. Hence\na data fusion is performed. With this fusion, it is possible to increase the sensitivity of the\nfeatures, and as a result, to obtain a damage index (DI) for each simulation. Thus, the Mahalanobis distance (MD) is used to reduce the volume of extracted data and preserve the most relevant information . Briefly, MD is a metric that measures the distance between two points in a feature space consisting of two or more variables, being independent of the\nscale of the features, thus allowing an increase in the sensitivity of the features to cases with damage. The MD, denoted here as DI, is calculated for each simulation using the followingin which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−], and ¯ x is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The MD is calculated for each sensor and for each simulation, obtaining a matrix of n distances per k number of sensors.Finally, the discrimination of the features consists in distinguishing the features as corresponding to a healthy or damaged case. At this stage of the methodology, an analysis of\nabnormal values is carried out, which will allow the condition of the train wheels to beautomatically monitored and these values to be classified into different classes. This phaseThe outlier analysis consists of grouping, by probabilistic distribution processes, the datato the previously created group. For this, a statistical confidence limit (CB) is used, based on the inverse cumulative Gaussian distribution function (ICDF), considering the mean\nvalue, ¯ μ, and standard deviation, σ, of the baseline feature vector.Whenever a value of a DI indicator is equal to or greater than CB, it is considered an outlier (the null hypothesis is rejected), thus representing a case of damage.For feature classification, a clustering process is used to divide the dataset into distinct clusters that should be as compact and separated as possible . For clustering, the k-meanson the distances of their vectors. Recent studies showed that the k-means algorithm has shown promising results . The main limitation of this technique is that it requires\nknowledge of the number of clusters in advance. For this purpose, the global silhouetteThis section presents the main results obtained through the application of the methodology proposed in section 3 to the calculated track responses. The methodology is applied using damaged wheel passages for the three simulated train speeds (60, 80 and 100 km/h),hyperparameters (presented in section 3). By adjusting these hyperparameters, it is possible to make the algorithm more efficient and improve the generalisation capabilities, as only\nthe most important features are retained. The optimisation of these hyperparameters isof data under analysis. Based on the principles of the SAE already outlined in other works\nIn the context of this study, the non-linear transfer functions (logsig) proved to be more effective than the linear ones, being the ones used in all the studied cases. After analysing Table 3, there is a similarity in the hyperparameters when comparing the two types of OOR damage. It is observed that the data compression level is the same for both cases, around\n93%, as 500 features are extracted in Bottleneck 2 from the initial input data with 7000\nConcerning the type of damage situation, the size of the ‘Bottleneck 1’ and ‘Bottleneck\n2’ was increased to bring them even closer to the initial amount of input data. This can beanalysis, making it challenging for the autoencoder to define relationships between the data, hence requiring a larger number. On the contrary, the maximum number of epochsIt is also important to emphasise that of the various hyperparameters presented, theOnce the hyperparameters have been defined, all the steps of the methodology are applied to the new dataset. For simplicity, in this section, only the last phase of the methodology will be presented, namely an outlier analysis for damage detection and cluster analysis for damage classification. For each sensor, a matrix n × m is created, where n\nis the number of test passages (baseline scenarios + damage scenarios), and m represents the number of extracted features. So, the size of the matrices is 210 × 2000 in case of the\ntype of damage, 75 × 500 for each amplitude in polygonal wheel, and 120 × 500 for wheelDespite the visual distinction between healthy and damaged wheels based on the data processing presented in subsection 3.2, unsupervised learning must use strategies capable of automatically detecting damage. To this end, an outlier analysis is employed, which consists of defining a confidence threshold using a significance level of 1% , represented**Figure 10.** Automatic OOR damage detection based on outlier analysis.by the green line in Figure 10. This approach makes it possible to successfully detect allTo distinguish the two types of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed. Figure 11\nshows a clear distinction between the damage, even when using a dataset with three different train speeds (60,80 and 100 km/h).. In the case of Figure 11a), using all four\naccelerometers, it is possible to efficiently separate the set into two large clusters, despite\n30 misclassifications (16 in the polygonisation and 14 in the flats). Even so, the accuracy\npercentage is around 85%, which is a very good result. To analyse the sensitivity to the number of sensors, only two sensors were used, one on each side ). The results\nimproved, with a decrease in the number of misclassifications from 30 to 21 (13 for polygonisation and 8 for flats). One explanation could be the disparity in sensor sensitivity to the damage, where some sensors are more sensitive than others due to their spatial positioning in relation to the damage. By merging the data from the less sensitive sensors with the\nmore sensitive ones, this could have a negative impact on the results. Thus, the percentage\nThe purpose behind presenting these two plots was to demonstrate that, whether using 4 sensors or 2 sensors, the classification remains remarkably robust, showing lowAfter identifying the type of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed once again to\nclassify the severity of each damage separately. Regarding polygonal wheels, the classification involves both amplitude and harmonic orders, leading to the clusters depicted in the obtained clusters reasonably reflect the two amplitude groups, with all misclassifications associated with the H6-8 harmonic cases (17 misclassifications). Once the amplitude\nis identified, harmonic classification must be carried out separately for each of the amplitudes. In Figure 12b), related to amplitude A1, it is observed that the obtained clusters**Figure 11.** Automatic OOR damage classification based on cluster analysis using: a) 4 sensors; b) 2are nearly perfect, with only 3 misclassifications. In Figure 12c), there are only 3 misclassifications, totalling 8 misclassifications in the classification of the number of dominant\nThe classification of harmonic order is only possible with the separation of amplitudes,\nFigure 13 presents the clusters obtained for the wheel flat cases. The separation between\nthe less severe group and baseline cases and intermediate (cluster 3) and severe cases (cluster 4) is reduced, resulting in a total of 19 misclassifications. Nevertheless, this result showsrate of about 84%. One possible reason for this significant number of misclassifications could be directly associated with the number of impacts captured by the sensor.In order to contribute to the safety of railway transportation and service quality, an automatic methodology based on machine learning has been proposed. This methodology can accurately detect and classify two types of OOR wheel damage in railway vehicles allowing to mitigate problems at both track and vehicle level, such as derailments or material\ndegradation. It includes a new technique for feature extraction based on a dedicated neural network, the Sparse Autoencoder. This non-linear technique is an upgrade concerning the commonly used linear techniques for feature extraction since it allows a better normalisation of the operational effects in the analysed data, as well as the reduction of large amounts\nof data without relying on other techniques, while keeping the most valuable information. These improvements are achieved through the use of different hyperparameters in**Figure 12.** Automatic classification of polygonal wheels based on cluster analysis: a) amplitude A1-A2;**Figure 13.** Automatic classification of wheel flats based on cluster analysis.the calculations, such as non-linear activation functions and sparsity terms. Consequently,circulation. Particularly in the railway engineering field, the inclusion of this technique\nshowed a good potential to deal with variable train speeds, essentially due to the amplifying effect on the measured track dynamic responses which could induce errors in damage The application of the methodology to the data set proved to be very successful in detecting and classifying the two types of OOR damages. Damage detection was perfect, without\nany false detection. In terms of classifying the type of damage, the results are very good,\nwith a success rate of around 85%, but if only two accelerometers are considered the successrate increases to around 90%. These results are encouraging since the range of speeds considered in the analysis, between 60 and 100 km/h, is the most representative of in-service\nfreight trains. Also, the results show that including the Sparse Autoencoder has a positive\neffect in the normalization of the train speed in the damage data set.\nRegarding the severity classification for each type of damage, the methodology proved equally successful in clustering the different damage severities. For polygonal wheels, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the severity groups in terms of defect amplitude, failing only for the H6-8 harmonic cases, and in terms of harmonic orders for each amplitude,\nwith almost perfect results. For wheel flats, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the three severity groups, though with some misclassifications between the less severe group\nand baseline cases and between intermediate and severe cases. A success rate of around 86%\nis achieved in the classification of polygonal wheel severities and 84% in the classification of wheel flat severities. Even so, these high success rates of over 80% show the robustness\nof this methodology in damage classification regardless of the train speed.on on-site measurements. Additionally, this methodology could be carried out for other types of railway vehicles, for example, passenger vehicles, since the dynamic responses are\ndifferent from freight vehicles. In that case, exploring other recent types of autoencoders,\nTo increase the complexity of the problem, the objective is to explore the concept of\nmultiple damages (same or different OOR types). For this, it will be necessary to incorporate a new stage in the methodology, the damage location stage, which will make it possible\nto distinguish isolated damage from multiple damage, as well as their respective location.\nThus, damage will be identified using cut signals, which will then be used to classify theThis work is a result of project WAY4SafeRail-WAYside monitoring system FOR SAFE RAIL transportation, with reference NORTE-01-0247-FEDER-069595, co-funded by the European Regional\nDevelopment Fund (ERDF), through the North Portugal Regional Operational Programme\nPartnership Agreement.

Within this context,\nan unsupervised methodology based on artificial intelligence techniques is presented, which allows the detection and classification of wheels, based on dynamic responses induced on the track by crossing freight railway vehicles. The methodology involves the following\nsteps: (i) data collection and pre-processing, (ii) feature extraction (iii)\ndata fusion and (iv) feature discrimination. In the first phase, an FFT\nalgorithm is applied to the acceleration track responses. Then, features are extracted after training a Stacked Sparse Autoencoder, in which the main features of the responses are obtained after a compression stage using an encoder network. This lower dimensional\nlayer forces the model to learn a compression of the input data. Then,\nwhich enhances the sensitivity to the damage recognition. Posteriorly, an outlier analysis is performed to distinguish a healthy wheelRail vehicle wheels are subjected to constant wear and tear due to continuous use and inadequate maintenance plans. Over time, this wear and tear can generate more significant defects, so it is extremely important to use sensing to understand when maintenance of both the track and rolling stock is required.

However, this type of system entail high costs envisaging the vehicle wheel condition monitoring, since sensors need to be installed in every vehicle in order to achieve a good representativity . On the other hand, wayside systems are a more viable solution for identifying wheel defects, since the condition of allThe most common wheel defects are known as OOR. As the name infers, this defect is related to deformations on the surface of the wheel circumference that make it not round.\nThis deformation can have many forms and different causes, leading to faults on the vehicle and on the track due to the higher dynamic force values [4–6]. The OOR damagesa function of their shape and size, vehicle characteristics and speed [7–10]. Wheel flats induce high dynamic impact loads on the railway infrastructure, which causes significant damage to both tracks and vehicles, such as broken axles, damaged rolling bearings and cracks in the wheels, rails and sleepers . Moreover, it also generates high vibrations\ntransmitted to the rolling stock, inducing significant stresses and causing damage to the In the case of polygonal wheels, the formation mechanism can be roughly classified\ninto three categories, namely, (1) initial wheel defects , (2) a natural vibration of the\nvehicle–track system and (3) thermoelastic instability . The formation mechanism is strongly contingent on the vehicle type and its operational characteristics, withof dominant harmonic orders [19–22]. For example, Tao et al. studied asymmetrical polygonal wear on metro wheels and obtained harmonic orders of 12–14, while another study by Tao et al. found that the most common harmonic order in Chinese freight trains is 18–19. Although a polygonal wheel could generate less impact on the track than a\nwheel flat, this defect can cause serious damage to the track due to resonance effects in the\nTo identify the occurrence of these OOR anomalies in train wheels, innovative\nmethodologies have been developed combining signal processing and automatic learning techniques. These methodologies are based on the extraction of damage sensitivity features, making possible the distinction between undamaged and damaged situations. Recently, many studies have shown good results in detecting OOR damages using\ndistinct approaches [24–29]. Mishra et al. concluded that a single FBG (Fiber Bragg Grating) sensor, positioned along the rail can detect the presence of wheel flats.\nLourenço et al. created an automatic algorithm for diagnosing OOR defects. The\nproposed methodology consists of isolating specific defective wheels and then identifying the severity of the damage, using only acceleration and strain data measured on\nthe track. In another study, Krummenacher et al. , proposed two machine-learningBy extracting the features, it is possible to transform the measured data into an alternative form of information where the correlation with damage is more easily observed. There are various techniques for feature extraction, the most common being CWT\n(continuous wavelet transform) [31–33], PCA (principal component analysis) ,detection of polygonal wheels on freight vehicles using CWT and ARX features, using\n6 accelerometers, 3 on each side of the railway track. Mosleh et al. introduced aflats by extracting AR features from acceleration records. Moreover, Mohammadi et al.\nadopted linear features, particularly, CWT, PCA, ARX and AR, and their research findingsin the context of wheel flat damage detection. Although these studies have demonstrated robust results in detection, they show some limitations in dealing with the non-linear effects associated with operational effects, such as the train speed. Due to the inability of these linear techniques to attenuate operation effects, the inclusion of different speeds\nFor most of these studies, a feature normalisation stage is used when it is necessary to remove the operational effects. Usually, latent variable methods are used, such as PCA or multiple linear regression (MLR) . Thus, to deal with the non-linear phenomena and reduce the large amounts of data without relying on the aforementioned methods,\nthe first artificial neural networks were created to inherently execute this task . Over the years, new and more advanced networks have been developed, with the Autoencoder\n(AE) being one of the main types. Later, Olshausen et al. proposed the creation of\nsparse coding and Ng et al. introduced a sparse penalisation term in the hidden layer,\nto acquire more compact and effective features from lower-dimensional data. For some datasets with complex relationships between characteristics, employing more than one SAE\nis necessary, which is why stacked sparse autoencoders (SSAE) are commonly used .\nNowadays, these types of AE are widely used in various scientific fields, but specifically\nfor structural engineering only a few studies are found, and most are about damage detection on bridges [45–47].

In another similar study, Amaral et al. , applied the same approach to\na numerical model of a highway viaduct in Brazil reaching more than 99% of successful classifications of structural damage with the combination of SAE and Support Vector Machine. Pathirage et al. proposed a framework utilizing SAE’s potential for dimensionality reduction, which facilitated the assessment of damage detection performance on Many of these AE algorithms already performed feature classification in order to discriminate the different types of damages and severities. However, the AE methods can also be combined with other techniques commonly used to classify the data. They can be used unsupervised methods, in which the model is trained without any labels provided to the\ntraining dataset, such as k-means , self-organising maps (SOM) , isolation forest, gaussian mixture model , k-medoids and cluster analysis , or supervised\nmethods, which assume that the hierarchy of database categories is known, such as NaiveBayes classifiers , k-Nearest Neighbours classifiers , Support Vector Machinetwo types of OOR damages, flats and polygonal wheels, based on acceleration responses obtained from a virtual wayside monitoring system.

The application of sensors on both sides of theTo obtain the responses from the railway track, it is necessary to apply sensors on the track that can measure the dynamic responses of the crossing trains. As it is not always possible\nto install them due to the high costs involved, simulations have been carried out based on calibrated models of the track , vehicle and considering their dynamic interaction,\nas well as including the track irregularities. Simulations include cases with healthy wheelsTo simulate the dynamic interactions between the vehicle and the track, an in-house software VSI – Vehicle-Structure Interaction Analysis is used, which was initially developed by\nNeves et al. and later improved by Montenegro et al. .

Including the track irregularities directly in the constraint equations are beneficial since it avoids explicitly considering\nthem in the FEM model. Moreover, it also allows to include the wheel and OOR profiles as a periodic rail irregularity, simplifying the analysis. Thus, before starting the analysis, the\nVSI software imports track irregularities and OOR profiles from a MATLAB file, whichto the vertical and lateral irregularities in each rail in each respective position, and adds it to the constraint equations of the system throughout the dynamics analysis. Then, the\nsystem of dynamic equations is solved using the typical Newmark integration method.\nThe impact of track irregularity on wheel defect classification is significant, as a lower track quality tends to result in a higher likelihood of misclassification. A comprehensive\nexploration of this influence was previously undertaken by Mosleh et al. as documented in their research study . Hence, this study does not delve into the impact of track\nquality; rather, it primarily centres on the utilisation of AI-based methodologies for the detection and classification of wheel defects. For this, four different profiles are used, based\non European Standard EN 13848–2 . In this case, power spectral density (PSD) curvesFor OOR defects, several profiles are defined based on real measurements in representative profiles of the various severities. Subsequently, the structural matrices are imported\nMore details on track and train properties, including additional information on traintrack interaction, can be found in previous publications . Figure 1 shows the\nvehicle–track interaction model schematisation and some details about the train and track\nsubsystems, as well as the track irregularities and wheel-rail contact model.According to the conclusions reached in other studies with this type of damage ,\nthe most promising location of the sensors is on the rail. To reduce installation and maintenance costs, it is important to reduce the number of sensors without compromising the\nquality of the results. Therefore, based on a sensitivity analysis performed during the study,\nonly two vertical unidirectional accelerometers were used on each rail, 4 in total (A1 to A4),\nsince they provided a higher cost–benefit ratio. These sensors are mounted on the rail atdefects, different simulation scenarios with perfect wheels (baseline) and OOR wheels\n(damage) were defined for a five-wagon Laagrss freight train. Based on different crossing speeds, loading schemes and rail irregularities profiles, 120 baseline and 180 damage scenarios (90 for polygonal wheels and 90 for wheel flats) were defined, as summarised in For baseline scenarios, six loading schemes with five different speeds (40, 60, 80, 100\nand 120 km/h) and four rail irregularity profiles were considered, giving a total of 120 scenarios. The loading schemes used are: empty, half-loaded, full-loaded and, additionally,For the damage cases, a total of 90 scenarios were generated for polygonal wheels. These\nscenarios including 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (H1, H2 and H3) x 10 different irregularity profiles within each specified harmonic interval. In these 10 irregularity\nprofiles, based on the defect amplitude, two amplitudes are considered, five simulations for\nA1 and five simulations for A2. Similarly, 90 scenarios were created for wheel flats, involving 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (F1, F2 and F3) x 10 different irregularitywheel radius . This wave phenomenon can be characterised by the different wavelengths formed (harmonics θ ), and by the levels of irregularity ( Lw ) associated with each of the harmonics. According to Peng , it is considered a polygonal wheel when the wear amplitude assumes values above 0. mm and wavelengths between 140 mm and the wheelTo define scenarios with polygonal wheels for the Laagrss wagon, a literature survey on\nexperimental measurements in defective wheels was conducted . Three experimental irregularity profiles were collected, illustrated in Figure 3. The first group (H6-8)\ncorresponds to a study carried out by Cai et al. with dominant harmonics from 6 to 8;**Figure 3.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) of polygonal wheels with**Figure 4.** Examples of polygonal damage profiles for each of the dominant harmonic intervals.the second group (H12-14) to a study authored by Tao et al. with dominant harmonics from 12 to 14; and the third profile (H17-18) to a study performed by Wu et al. with\nBased on the wheel irregularity spectra ( Lw ) taken from the respective measurement profiles, shown in Figure 3, and considering the contribution of the first 30 harmonics, several irregularity profiles were generated, according to Figure 4.

After obtaining the acceleration measurements from the numerical simulations, an FFT algorithm is applied to the time series allowing the conversion of the signal from the time domain to the frequency domain. Then,predefined hyperparameters of the algorithm. The set hyperparameters are encoding and\ndecoding transfer functions, hidden layer size, maximum number of epochs, L2 weight regularisation term, sparsity regularisation term and a sparsity proportion term. Afterwards,**Figure 7.** Flowchart with the main phases of the methodology for detection and classification of OORthe features are extracted in the more compressed layer of the SAE, the so-called bottleneck layer. The number of features obtained is equal to the number of hidden layers which\nis usually considerably lower than the data size, allowing a compression of the input data.\nFurthermore, to enhance the sensitivity to damage, two levels of data fusion are applied to the bottleneck features using the Mahalanobis distance. In the first level, all features are\nfused into a damage index (DI) for each sensor and, in the second level, all the sensors\nare merged resulting in only one DI for each simulation. Finally, automatic damage detection is achieved by performing an outlier analysis, in which a statistical confidence limit\n(CB) is used, based on the Inverse Cumulative Gaussian Distribution Function (ICDF).\nFor feature classification, an automatic clustering process based on the k-means technique is implemented. This algorithm allows for the unsupervised and automatic classification of data, based on the calculation of statistical distances between objects. In k-means technique given a vector of data and chosen k clusters, the key is to find k centroids that minimise\nthe distance of each vector to its nearest centroid . Since it is necessary to define the number of clusters in advance, a global Silhouette index (SIL) was adopted to make\nan automatic process. At the end, the clusters will allow the classification of the two typesbetween the number of correct classifications and the total number of cases.damage detection problems, as it allows a signal to be converted from the time domain to the frequency domain, to capture the excitation frequencies induced by the wheel defects.\nIn addition, a data reduction is carried out at this stage, since the initial records contain aa crossing speed of 80 km/h. When comparing the FFT spectra for a train passage with flats, Figure 8a), with polygonal wheels, Figure 8b), there are visible differences in terms\nof amplitude peak values and excited frequency ranges. For flats, the amplitude peak values are higher and they induce frequencies in the range between DC and 1500accordance with some authors reports . In terms of severities, for flats, the more severe group (55–100 mm) is the one with the higher frequency content, as expected,a baseline response. For polygonal wheels, from the analysis of Figure 8b), it can be seen the frequency peaks for the H12–14 and H17–18 profiles around 100 and 150\nrespectively, while for the profile H6-8 a more flat spectrum is obtained without showing any significant peak. This can be explained by the irregularity level profile of thisThese two graphs can show which frequencies have higher content in the original signal.Autoencoders are artificial neural networks trained using an unsupervised approach,\nwhich aim first to learn coded representations of the data, compressing the input into\na latent space representation, and second, through this compressed information, reconstructing the information. The basic architecture of this type of network consists of threewhere **Wij**, **Wjk** are the weights connection matrices between input layer-hidden\nlayer and hidden layer-output layer, **X** = ( **X** 1, **X** 2, . . ., **Xn** ) is the input data vector,\n**H** = ( **H** 1, . . ., **Hm** ) is the low-dimensional vector and **X** [ˆ] = ( **X** [ˆ] 1, **X** [ˆ] 2, . . ., **X** [ˆ] **n** ) is the output**Figure 8.** Frequency domain responses on position 1 for the crossing speed of 80 km/h: (a) wheel flats,data vector. **b** 1, **b** 2 are bias vectors and σ 1, σ 2 are the activation function used in each of thereconstruction of the input X [ˆ], as shown in Equation (3).

After incorporating various inputs into the SSAE training, they are integrated into the so-called\n‘Input 1’. As training progresses, the data is compressed, and the main characteristics of the signals are obtained and retained in ‘Bottleneck 1’. Subsequently, these characteristics are\nused as input for training the second sparse autoencoder, which, after further compression,\nenables the extraction of the final features. Depending on the type of data under analysis,\nthe compression level differs, so multiple tests should be conducted to optimise these layer sizes. This optimisation was achieved by trial and test, changing both the size of the first\nIt should be noted that this network architecture, where the dimensions of the layers gradually decrease along the network until reaching the bottleneck layer , has proven\nto be highly robust for the type of data used. It allows for effective compression of results**Figure 9.** Schematic of the structure of the SSAE neural network used in this study.After extracting the features from the bottleneck layer of the SSAE, the difference between the healthy wheels scenarios and the damage wheels scenarios is still not sufficient. Hence\na data fusion is performed. With this fusion, it is possible to increase the sensitivity of the\nfeatures, and as a result, to obtain a damage index (DI) for each simulation. Thus, the Mahalanobis distance (MD) is used to reduce the volume of extracted data and preserve the most relevant information . Briefly, MD is a metric that measures the distance between two points in a feature space consisting of two or more variables, being independent of the\nscale of the features, thus allowing an increase in the sensitivity of the features to cases with damage. The MD, denoted here as DI, is calculated for each simulation using the followingin which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−], and ¯ x is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The MD is calculated for each sensor and for each simulation, obtaining a matrix of n distances per k number of sensors.Finally, the discrimination of the features consists in distinguishing the features as corresponding to a healthy or damaged case. At this stage of the methodology, an analysis of\nabnormal values is carried out, which will allow the condition of the train wheels to beautomatically monitored and these values to be classified into different classes. This phaseThe outlier analysis consists of grouping, by probabilistic distribution processes, the datato the previously created group. For this, a statistical confidence limit (CB) is used, based on the inverse cumulative Gaussian distribution function (ICDF), considering the mean\nvalue, ¯ μ, and standard deviation, σ, of the baseline feature vector.Whenever a value of a DI indicator is equal to or greater than CB, it is considered an outlier (the null hypothesis is rejected), thus representing a case of damage.For feature classification, a clustering process is used to divide the dataset into distinct clusters that should be as compact and separated as possible . For clustering, the k-meanson the distances of their vectors. Recent studies showed that the k-means algorithm has shown promising results . The main limitation of this technique is that it requires\nknowledge of the number of clusters in advance. For this purpose, the global silhouetteThis section presents the main results obtained through the application of the methodology proposed in section 3 to the calculated track responses. The methodology is applied using damaged wheel passages for the three simulated train speeds (60, 80 and 100 km/h),hyperparameters (presented in section 3). By adjusting these hyperparameters, it is possible to make the algorithm more efficient and improve the generalisation capabilities, as only\nthe most important features are retained. The optimisation of these hyperparameters isof data under analysis. Based on the principles of the SAE already outlined in other works\nIn the context of this study, the non-linear transfer functions (logsig) proved to be more effective than the linear ones, being the ones used in all the studied cases. After analysing Table 3, there is a similarity in the hyperparameters when comparing the two types of OOR damage. It is observed that the data compression level is the same for both cases, around\n93%, as 500 features are extracted in Bottleneck 2 from the initial input data with 7000\nConcerning the type of damage situation, the size of the ‘Bottleneck 1’ and ‘Bottleneck\n2’ was increased to bring them even closer to the initial amount of input data. This can beanalysis, making it challenging for the autoencoder to define relationships between the data, hence requiring a larger number. On the contrary, the maximum number of epochsIt is also important to emphasise that of the various hyperparameters presented, theOnce the hyperparameters have been defined, all the steps of the methodology are applied to the new dataset. For simplicity, in this section, only the last phase of the methodology will be presented, namely an outlier analysis for damage detection and cluster analysis for damage classification. For each sensor, a matrix n × m is created, where n\nis the number of test passages (baseline scenarios + damage scenarios), and m represents the number of extracted features. So, the size of the matrices is 210 × 2000 in case of the\ntype of damage, 75 × 500 for each amplitude in polygonal wheel, and 120 × 500 for wheelDespite the visual distinction between healthy and damaged wheels based on the data processing presented in subsection 3.2, unsupervised learning must use strategies capable of automatically detecting damage. To this end, an outlier analysis is employed, which consists of defining a confidence threshold using a significance level of 1% , represented**Figure 10.** Automatic OOR damage detection based on outlier analysis.by the green line in Figure 10. This approach makes it possible to successfully detect allTo distinguish the two types of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed. Figure 11\nshows a clear distinction between the damage, even when using a dataset with three different train speeds (60,80 and 100 km/h).. In the case of Figure 11a), using all four\naccelerometers, it is possible to efficiently separate the set into two large clusters, despite\n30 misclassifications (16 in the polygonisation and 14 in the flats). Even so, the accuracy\npercentage is around 85%, which is a very good result. To analyse the sensitivity to the number of sensors, only two sensors were used, one on each side ). The results\nimproved, with a decrease in the number of misclassifications from 30 to 21 (13 for polygonisation and 8 for flats). One explanation could be the disparity in sensor sensitivity to the damage, where some sensors are more sensitive than others due to their spatial positioning in relation to the damage. By merging the data from the less sensitive sensors with the\nmore sensitive ones, this could have a negative impact on the results. Thus, the percentage\nThe purpose behind presenting these two plots was to demonstrate that, whether using 4 sensors or 2 sensors, the classification remains remarkably robust, showing lowAfter identifying the type of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed once again to\nclassify the severity of each damage separately. Regarding polygonal wheels, the classification involves both amplitude and harmonic orders, leading to the clusters depicted in the obtained clusters reasonably reflect the two amplitude groups, with all misclassifications associated with the H6-8 harmonic cases (17 misclassifications). Once the amplitude\nis identified, harmonic classification must be carried out separately for each of the amplitudes. In Figure 12b), related to amplitude A1, it is observed that the obtained clusters**Figure 11.** Automatic OOR damage classification based on cluster analysis using: a) 4 sensors; b) 2are nearly perfect, with only 3 misclassifications. In Figure 12c), there are only 3 misclassifications, totalling 8 misclassifications in the classification of the number of dominant\nThe classification of harmonic order is only possible with the separation of amplitudes,\nFigure 13 presents the clusters obtained for the wheel flat cases. The separation between\nthe less severe group and baseline cases and intermediate (cluster 3) and severe cases (cluster 4) is reduced, resulting in a total of 19 misclassifications. Nevertheless, this result showsrate of about 84%. One possible reason for this significant number of misclassifications could be directly associated with the number of impacts captured by the sensor.In order to contribute to the safety of railway transportation and service quality, an automatic methodology based on machine learning has been proposed. This methodology can accurately detect and classify two types of OOR wheel damage in railway vehicles allowing to mitigate problems at both track and vehicle level, such as derailments or material\ndegradation. It includes a new technique for feature extraction based on a dedicated neural network, the Sparse Autoencoder. This non-linear technique is an upgrade concerning the commonly used linear techniques for feature extraction since it allows a better normalisation of the operational effects in the analysed data, as well as the reduction of large amounts\nof data without relying on other techniques, while keeping the most valuable information. These improvements are achieved through the use of different hyperparameters in**Figure 12.** Automatic classification of polygonal wheels based on cluster analysis: a) amplitude A1-A2;**Figure 13.** Automatic classification of wheel flats based on cluster analysis.the calculations, such as non-linear activation functions and sparsity terms. Consequently,circulation. Particularly in the railway engineering field, the inclusion of this technique\nshowed a good potential to deal with variable train speeds, essentially due to the amplifying effect on the measured track dynamic responses which could induce errors in damage The application of the methodology to the data set proved to be very successful in detecting and classifying the two types of OOR damages. Damage detection was perfect, without\nany false detection. In terms of classifying the type of damage, the results are very good,\nwith a success rate of around 85%, but if only two accelerometers are considered the successrate increases to around 90%. These results are encouraging since the range of speeds considered in the analysis, between 60 and 100 km/h, is the most representative of in-service\nfreight trains. Also, the results show that including the Sparse Autoencoder has a positive\neffect in the normalization of the train speed in the damage data set.\nRegarding the severity classification for each type of damage, the methodology proved equally successful in clustering the different damage severities. For polygonal wheels, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the severity groups in terms of defect amplitude, failing only for the H6-8 harmonic cases, and in terms of harmonic orders for each amplitude,\nwith almost perfect results. For wheel flats, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the three severity groups, though with some misclassifications between the less severe group\nand baseline cases and between intermediate and severe cases. A success rate of around 86%\nis achieved in the classification of polygonal wheel severities and 84% in the classification of wheel flat severities. Even so, these high success rates of over 80% show the robustness\nof this methodology in damage classification regardless of the train speed.on on-site measurements. Additionally, this methodology could be carried out for other types of railway vehicles, for example, passenger vehicles, since the dynamic responses are\ndifferent from freight vehicles. In that case, exploring other recent types of autoencoders,\nTo increase the complexity of the problem, the objective is to explore the concept of\nmultiple damages (same or different OOR types). For this, it will be necessary to incorporate a new stage in the methodology, the damage location stage, which will make it possible\nto distinguish isolated damage from multiple damage, as well as their respective location.\nThus, damage will be identified using cut signals, which will then be used to classify theThis work is a result of project WAY4SafeRail-WAYside monitoring system FOR SAFE RAIL transportation, with reference NORTE-01-0247-FEDER-069595, co-funded by the European Regional\nDevelopment Fund (ERDF), through the North Portugal Regional Operational Programme\nPartnership Agreement.

Within this context,\nan unsupervised methodology based on artificial intelligence techniques is presented, which allows the detection and classification of wheels, based on dynamic responses induced on the track by crossing freight railway vehicles. The methodology involves the following\nsteps: (i) data collection and pre-processing, (ii) feature extraction (iii)\ndata fusion and (iv) feature discrimination. In the first phase, an FFT\nalgorithm is applied to the acceleration track responses. Then, features are extracted after training a Stacked Sparse Autoencoder, in which the main features of the responses are obtained after a compression stage using an encoder network. This lower dimensional\nlayer forces the model to learn a compression of the input data. Then,\nwhich enhances the sensitivity to the damage recognition. Posteriorly, an outlier analysis is performed to distinguish a healthy wheelRail vehicle wheels are subjected to constant wear and tear due to continuous use and inadequate maintenance plans. Over time, this wear and tear can generate more significant defects, so it is extremely important to use sensing to understand when maintenance of both the track and rolling stock is required.

However, this type of system entail high costs envisaging the vehicle wheel condition monitoring, since sensors need to be installed in every vehicle in order to achieve a good representativity . On the other hand, wayside systems are a more viable solution for identifying wheel defects, since the condition of allThe most common wheel defects are known as OOR. As the name infers, this defect is related to deformations on the surface of the wheel circumference that make it not round.\nThis deformation can have many forms and different causes, leading to faults on the vehicle and on the track due to the higher dynamic force values [4–6]. The OOR damagesa function of their shape and size, vehicle characteristics and speed [7–10]. Wheel flats induce high dynamic impact loads on the railway infrastructure, which causes significant damage to both tracks and vehicles, such as broken axles, damaged rolling bearings and cracks in the wheels, rails and sleepers . Moreover, it also generates high vibrations\ntransmitted to the rolling stock, inducing significant stresses and causing damage to the In the case of polygonal wheels, the formation mechanism can be roughly classified\ninto three categories, namely, (1) initial wheel defects , (2) a natural vibration of the\nvehicle–track system and (3) thermoelastic instability . The formation mechanism is strongly contingent on the vehicle type and its operational characteristics, withof dominant harmonic orders [19–22]. For example, Tao et al. studied asymmetrical polygonal wear on metro wheels and obtained harmonic orders of 12–14, while another study by Tao et al. found that the most common harmonic order in Chinese freight trains is 18–19. Although a polygonal wheel could generate less impact on the track than a\nwheel flat, this defect can cause serious damage to the track due to resonance effects in the\nTo identify the occurrence of these OOR anomalies in train wheels, innovative\nmethodologies have been developed combining signal processing and automatic learning techniques. These methodologies are based on the extraction of damage sensitivity features, making possible the distinction between undamaged and damaged situations. Recently, many studies have shown good results in detecting OOR damages using\ndistinct approaches [24–29]. Mishra et al. concluded that a single FBG (Fiber Bragg Grating) sensor, positioned along the rail can detect the presence of wheel flats.\nLourenço et al. created an automatic algorithm for diagnosing OOR defects. The\nproposed methodology consists of isolating specific defective wheels and then identifying the severity of the damage, using only acceleration and strain data measured on\nthe track. In another study, Krummenacher et al. , proposed two machine-learningBy extracting the features, it is possible to transform the measured data into an alternative form of information where the correlation with damage is more easily observed. There are various techniques for feature extraction, the most common being CWT\n(continuous wavelet transform) [31–33], PCA (principal component analysis) ,detection of polygonal wheels on freight vehicles using CWT and ARX features, using\n6 accelerometers, 3 on each side of the railway track. Mosleh et al. introduced aflats by extracting AR features from acceleration records. Moreover, Mohammadi et al.\nadopted linear features, particularly, CWT, PCA, ARX and AR, and their research findingsin the context of wheel flat damage detection. Although these studies have demonstrated robust results in detection, they show some limitations in dealing with the non-linear effects associated with operational effects, such as the train speed. Due to the inability of these linear techniques to attenuate operation effects, the inclusion of different speeds\nFor most of these studies, a feature normalisation stage is used when it is necessary to remove the operational effects. Usually, latent variable methods are used, such as PCA or multiple linear regression (MLR) . Thus, to deal with the non-linear phenomena and reduce the large amounts of data without relying on the aforementioned methods,\nthe first artificial neural networks were created to inherently execute this task . Over the years, new and more advanced networks have been developed, with the Autoencoder\n(AE) being one of the main types. Later, Olshausen et al. proposed the creation of\nsparse coding and Ng et al. introduced a sparse penalisation term in the hidden layer,\nto acquire more compact and effective features from lower-dimensional data. For some datasets with complex relationships between characteristics, employing more than one SAE\nis necessary, which is why stacked sparse autoencoders (SSAE) are commonly used .\nNowadays, these types of AE are widely used in various scientific fields, but specifically\nfor structural engineering only a few studies are found, and most are about damage detection on bridges [45–47].

Pathirage et al. proposed a framework utilizing SAE’s potential for dimensionality reduction, which facilitated the assessment of damage detection performance on Many of these AE algorithms already performed feature classification in order to discriminate the different types of damages and severities. However, the AE methods can also be combined with other techniques commonly used to classify the data. They can be used unsupervised methods, in which the model is trained without any labels provided to the\ntraining dataset, such as k-means , self-organising maps (SOM) , isolation forest, gaussian mixture model , k-medoids and cluster analysis , or supervised\nmethods, which assume that the hierarchy of database categories is known, such as NaiveBayes classifiers , k-Nearest Neighbours classifiers , Support Vector Machinetwo types of OOR damages, flats and polygonal wheels, based on acceleration responses obtained from a virtual wayside monitoring system.

The application of sensors on both sides of theTo obtain the responses from the railway track, it is necessary to apply sensors on the track that can measure the dynamic responses of the crossing trains. As it is not always possible\nto install them due to the high costs involved, simulations have been carried out based on calibrated models of the track , vehicle and considering their dynamic interaction,\nas well as including the track irregularities. Simulations include cases with healthy wheelsTo simulate the dynamic interactions between the vehicle and the track, an in-house software VSI – Vehicle-Structure Interaction Analysis is used, which was initially developed by\nNeves et al. and later improved by Montenegro et al. .

Including the track irregularities directly in the constraint equations are beneficial since it avoids explicitly considering\nthem in the FEM model. Moreover, it also allows to include the wheel and OOR profiles as a periodic rail irregularity, simplifying the analysis. Thus, before starting the analysis, the\nVSI software imports track irregularities and OOR profiles from a MATLAB file, whichto the vertical and lateral irregularities in each rail in each respective position, and adds it to the constraint equations of the system throughout the dynamics analysis. Then, the\nsystem of dynamic equations is solved using the typical Newmark integration method.\nThe impact of track irregularity on wheel defect classification is significant, as a lower track quality tends to result in a higher likelihood of misclassification. A comprehensive\nexploration of this influence was previously undertaken by Mosleh et al. as documented in their research study . Hence, this study does not delve into the impact of track\nquality; rather, it primarily centres on the utilisation of AI-based methodologies for the detection and classification of wheel defects. For this, four different profiles are used, based\non European Standard EN 13848–2 . In this case, power spectral density (PSD) curvesFor OOR defects, several profiles are defined based on real measurements in representative profiles of the various severities. Subsequently, the structural matrices are imported\nMore details on track and train properties, including additional information on traintrack interaction, can be found in previous publications . Figure 1 shows the\nvehicle–track interaction model schematisation and some details about the train and track\nsubsystems, as well as the track irregularities and wheel-rail contact model.According to the conclusions reached in other studies with this type of damage ,\nthe most promising location of the sensors is on the rail. To reduce installation and maintenance costs, it is important to reduce the number of sensors without compromising the\nquality of the results. Therefore, based on a sensitivity analysis performed during the study,\nonly two vertical unidirectional accelerometers were used on each rail, 4 in total (A1 to A4),\nsince they provided a higher cost–benefit ratio. These sensors are mounted on the rail atdefects, different simulation scenarios with perfect wheels (baseline) and OOR wheels\n(damage) were defined for a five-wagon Laagrss freight train. Based on different crossing speeds, loading schemes and rail irregularities profiles, 120 baseline and 180 damage scenarios (90 for polygonal wheels and 90 for wheel flats) were defined, as summarised in For baseline scenarios, six loading schemes with five different speeds (40, 60, 80, 100\nand 120 km/h) and four rail irregularity profiles were considered, giving a total of 120 scenarios. The loading schemes used are: empty, half-loaded, full-loaded and, additionally,For the damage cases, a total of 90 scenarios were generated for polygonal wheels. These\nscenarios including 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (H1, H2 and H3) x 10 different irregularity profiles within each specified harmonic interval. In these 10 irregularity\nprofiles, based on the defect amplitude, two amplitudes are considered, five simulations for\nA1 and five simulations for A2. Similarly, 90 scenarios were created for wheel flats, involving 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (F1, F2 and F3) x 10 different irregularitywheel radius . This wave phenomenon can be characterised by the different wavelengths formed (harmonics θ ), and by the levels of irregularity ( Lw ) associated with each of the harmonics. According to Peng , it is considered a polygonal wheel when the wear amplitude assumes values above 0. mm and wavelengths between 140 mm and the wheelTo define scenarios with polygonal wheels for the Laagrss wagon, a literature survey on\nexperimental measurements in defective wheels was conducted . Three experimental irregularity profiles were collected, illustrated in Figure 3. The first group (H6-8)\ncorresponds to a study carried out by Cai et al. with dominant harmonics from 6 to 8;**Figure 3.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) of polygonal wheels with**Figure 4.** Examples of polygonal damage profiles for each of the dominant harmonic intervals.the second group (H12-14) to a study authored by Tao et al. with dominant harmonics from 12 to 14; and the third profile (H17-18) to a study performed by Wu et al. with\nBased on the wheel irregularity spectra ( Lw ) taken from the respective measurement profiles, shown in Figure 3, and considering the contribution of the first 30 harmonics, several irregularity profiles were generated, according to Figure 4.

Then,predefined hyperparameters of the algorithm. The set hyperparameters are encoding and\ndecoding transfer functions, hidden layer size, maximum number of epochs, L2 weight regularisation term, sparsity regularisation term and a sparsity proportion term. Afterwards,**Figure 7.** Flowchart with the main phases of the methodology for detection and classification of OORthe features are extracted in the more compressed layer of the SAE, the so-called bottleneck layer. The number of features obtained is equal to the number of hidden layers which\nis usually considerably lower than the data size, allowing a compression of the input data.\nFurthermore, to enhance the sensitivity to damage, two levels of data fusion are applied to the bottleneck features using the Mahalanobis distance. In the first level, all features are\nfused into a damage index (DI) for each sensor and, in the second level, all the sensors\nare merged resulting in only one DI for each simulation. Finally, automatic damage detection is achieved by performing an outlier analysis, in which a statistical confidence limit\n(CB) is used, based on the Inverse Cumulative Gaussian Distribution Function (ICDF).\nFor feature classification, an automatic clustering process based on the k-means technique is implemented. This algorithm allows for the unsupervised and automatic classification of data, based on the calculation of statistical distances between objects. In k-means technique given a vector of data and chosen k clusters, the key is to find k centroids that minimise\nthe distance of each vector to its nearest centroid . Since it is necessary to define the number of clusters in advance, a global Silhouette index (SIL) was adopted to make\nan automatic process. At the end, the clusters will allow the classification of the two typesbetween the number of correct classifications and the total number of cases.damage detection problems, as it allows a signal to be converted from the time domain to the frequency domain, to capture the excitation frequencies induced by the wheel defects.\nIn addition, a data reduction is carried out at this stage, since the initial records contain aa crossing speed of 80 km/h. When comparing the FFT spectra for a train passage with flats, Figure 8a), with polygonal wheels, Figure 8b), there are visible differences in terms\nof amplitude peak values and excited frequency ranges. For flats, the amplitude peak values are higher and they induce frequencies in the range between DC and 1500accordance with some authors reports . In terms of severities, for flats, the more severe group (55–100 mm) is the one with the higher frequency content, as expected,a baseline response. For polygonal wheels, from the analysis of Figure 8b), it can be seen the frequency peaks for the H12–14 and H17–18 profiles around 100 and 150\nrespectively, while for the profile H6-8 a more flat spectrum is obtained without showing any significant peak. This can be explained by the irregularity level profile of thisThese two graphs can show which frequencies have higher content in the original signal.Autoencoders are artificial neural networks trained using an unsupervised approach,\nwhich aim first to learn coded representations of the data, compressing the input into\na latent space representation, and second, through this compressed information, reconstructing the information. The basic architecture of this type of network consists of threewhere **Wij**, **Wjk** are the weights connection matrices between input layer-hidden\nlayer and hidden layer-output layer, **X** = ( **X** 1, **X** 2, . . ., **Xn** ) is the input data vector,\n**H** = ( **H** 1, . . ., **Hm** ) is the low-dimensional vector and **X** [ˆ] = ( **X** [ˆ] 1, **X** [ˆ] 2, . . ., **X** [ˆ] **n** ) is the output**Figure 8.** Frequency domain responses on position 1 for the crossing speed of 80 km/h: (a) wheel flats,data vector. **b** 1, **b** 2 are bias vectors and σ 1, σ 2 are the activation function used in each of thereconstruction of the input X [ˆ], as shown in Equation (3). This function uses the meanIn the Sparse Autoencoder, to make the coding more efficient, two regularisation terms,\nsparse penalty term and weight regularisation term, are added to the error function, causing only a subset of neurons to be activated. The average activation of neurons in the hiddenAs the average activation ˆ ρ is intended to be close to a constant ρ (sparsity proportion)\nand it is usually a small positive number near 0, the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence isIn addition to this, a weight regularisation term, called L2 regularisation, is also addedwhere L is the number of hidden layers, nl the output size of layer l, kl the input size ofwhere μ is the coefficient for the L2 regularisation term and β the coefficient for the sparsityAfter data pre-processing, the acceleration responses in the frequency domain, are then In this work, two layers of SAE’s were used to form the network, as shown in Figure 9.layers, with the outputs of the previous autoencoder serving as input for the next one. After incorporating various inputs into the SSAE training, they are integrated into the so-called\n‘Input 1’. As training progresses, the data is compressed, and the main characteristics of the signals are obtained and retained in ‘Bottleneck 1’. Subsequently, these characteristics are\nused as input for training the second sparse autoencoder, which, after further compression,\nenables the extraction of the final features. Depending on the type of data under analysis,\nthe compression level differs, so multiple tests should be conducted to optimise these layer sizes. This optimisation was achieved by trial and test, changing both the size of the first\nIt should be noted that this network architecture, where the dimensions of the layers gradually decrease along the network until reaching the bottleneck layer , has proven\nto be highly robust for the type of data used. It allows for effective compression of results**Figure 9.** Schematic of the structure of the SSAE neural network used in this study.After extracting the features from the bottleneck layer of the SSAE, the difference between the healthy wheels scenarios and the damage wheels scenarios is still not sufficient. Hence\na data fusion is performed. With this fusion, it is possible to increase the sensitivity of the\nfeatures, and as a result, to obtain a damage index (DI) for each simulation. Thus, the Mahalanobis distance (MD) is used to reduce the volume of extracted data and preserve the most relevant information . Briefly, MD is a metric that measures the distance between two points in a feature space consisting of two or more variables, being independent of the\nscale of the features, thus allowing an increase in the sensitivity of the features to cases with damage. The MD, denoted here as DI, is calculated for each simulation using the followingin which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−], and ¯ x is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The MD is calculated for each sensor and for each simulation, obtaining a matrix of n distances per k number of sensors.Finally, the discrimination of the features consists in distinguishing the features as corresponding to a healthy or damaged case. At this stage of the methodology, an analysis of\nabnormal values is carried out, which will allow the condition of the train wheels to beautomatically monitored and these values to be classified into different classes. This phaseThe outlier analysis consists of grouping, by probabilistic distribution processes, the datato the previously created group. For this, a statistical confidence limit (CB) is used, based on the inverse cumulative Gaussian distribution function (ICDF), considering the mean\nvalue, ¯ μ, and standard deviation, σ, of the baseline feature vector.Whenever a value of a DI indicator is equal to or greater than CB, it is considered an outlier (the null hypothesis is rejected), thus representing a case of damage.For feature classification, a clustering process is used to divide the dataset into distinct clusters that should be as compact and separated as possible . For clustering, the k-meanson the distances of their vectors. Recent studies showed that the k-means algorithm has shown promising results . The main limitation of this technique is that it requires\nknowledge of the number of clusters in advance. For this purpose, the global silhouetteThis section presents the main results obtained through the application of the methodology proposed in section 3 to the calculated track responses. The methodology is applied using damaged wheel passages for the three simulated train speeds (60, 80 and 100 km/h),hyperparameters (presented in section 3). By adjusting these hyperparameters, it is possible to make the algorithm more efficient and improve the generalisation capabilities, as only\nthe most important features are retained. The optimisation of these hyperparameters isof data under analysis. Based on the principles of the SAE already outlined in other works\nIn the context of this study, the non-linear transfer functions (logsig) proved to be more effective than the linear ones, being the ones used in all the studied cases. After analysing Table 3, there is a similarity in the hyperparameters when comparing the two types of OOR damage. It is observed that the data compression level is the same for both cases, around\n93%, as 500 features are extracted in Bottleneck 2 from the initial input data with 7000\nConcerning the type of damage situation, the size of the ‘Bottleneck 1’ and ‘Bottleneck\n2’ was increased to bring them even closer to the initial amount of input data. This can beanalysis, making it challenging for the autoencoder to define relationships between the data, hence requiring a larger number. On the contrary, the maximum number of epochsIt is also important to emphasise that of the various hyperparameters presented, theOnce the hyperparameters have been defined, all the steps of the methodology are applied to the new dataset. For simplicity, in this section, only the last phase of the methodology will be presented, namely an outlier analysis for damage detection and cluster analysis for damage classification. For each sensor, a matrix n × m is created, where n\nis the number of test passages (baseline scenarios + damage scenarios), and m represents the number of extracted features. So, the size of the matrices is 210 × 2000 in case of the\ntype of damage, 75 × 500 for each amplitude in polygonal wheel, and 120 × 500 for wheelDespite the visual distinction between healthy and damaged wheels based on the data processing presented in subsection 3.2, unsupervised learning must use strategies capable of automatically detecting damage. To this end, an outlier analysis is employed, which consists of defining a confidence threshold using a significance level of 1% , represented**Figure 10.** Automatic OOR damage detection based on outlier analysis.by the green line in Figure 10. This approach makes it possible to successfully detect allTo distinguish the two types of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed. Figure 11\nshows a clear distinction between the damage, even when using a dataset with three different train speeds (60,80 and 100 km/h).. In the case of Figure 11a), using all four\naccelerometers, it is possible to efficiently separate the set into two large clusters, despite\n30 misclassifications (16 in the polygonisation and 14 in the flats). Even so, the accuracy\npercentage is around 85%, which is a very good result. To analyse the sensitivity to the number of sensors, only two sensors were used, one on each side ). The results\nimproved, with a decrease in the number of misclassifications from 30 to 21 (13 for polygonisation and 8 for flats). One explanation could be the disparity in sensor sensitivity to the damage, where some sensors are more sensitive than others due to their spatial positioning in relation to the damage. By merging the data from the less sensitive sensors with the\nmore sensitive ones, this could have a negative impact on the results. Thus, the percentage\nThe purpose behind presenting these two plots was to demonstrate that, whether using 4 sensors or 2 sensors, the classification remains remarkably robust, showing lowAfter identifying the type of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed once again to\nclassify the severity of each damage separately. Regarding polygonal wheels, the classification involves both amplitude and harmonic orders, leading to the clusters depicted in the obtained clusters reasonably reflect the two amplitude groups, with all misclassifications associated with the H6-8 harmonic cases (17 misclassifications). Once the amplitude\nis identified, harmonic classification must be carried out separately for each of the amplitudes. In Figure 12b), related to amplitude A1, it is observed that the obtained clusters**Figure 11.** Automatic OOR damage classification based on cluster analysis using: a) 4 sensors; b) 2are nearly perfect, with only 3 misclassifications. In Figure 12c), there are only 3 misclassifications, totalling 8 misclassifications in the classification of the number of dominant\nThe classification of harmonic order is only possible with the separation of amplitudes,\nFigure 13 presents the clusters obtained for the wheel flat cases. The separation between\nthe less severe group and baseline cases and intermediate (cluster 3) and severe cases (cluster 4) is reduced, resulting in a total of 19 misclassifications. Nevertheless, this result showsrate of about 84%. One possible reason for this significant number of misclassifications could be directly associated with the number of impacts captured by the sensor.In order to contribute to the safety of railway transportation and service quality, an automatic methodology based on machine learning has been proposed. This methodology can accurately detect and classify two types of OOR wheel damage in railway vehicles allowing to mitigate problems at both track and vehicle level, such as derailments or material\ndegradation. It includes a new technique for feature extraction based on a dedicated neural network, the Sparse Autoencoder. This non-linear technique is an upgrade concerning the commonly used linear techniques for feature extraction since it allows a better normalisation of the operational effects in the analysed data, as well as the reduction of large amounts\nof data without relying on other techniques, while keeping the most valuable information. These improvements are achieved through the use of different hyperparameters in**Figure 12.** Automatic classification of polygonal wheels based on cluster analysis: a) amplitude A1-A2;**Figure 13.** Automatic classification of wheel flats based on cluster analysis.the calculations, such as non-linear activation functions and sparsity terms. Consequently,circulation. Particularly in the railway engineering field, the inclusion of this technique\nshowed a good potential to deal with variable train speeds, essentially due to the amplifying effect on the measured track dynamic responses which could induce errors in damage The application of the methodology to the data set proved to be very successful in detecting and classifying the two types of OOR damages. Damage detection was perfect, without\nany false detection. In terms of classifying the type of damage, the results are very good,\nwith a success rate of around 85%, but if only two accelerometers are considered the successrate increases to around 90%. These results are encouraging since the range of speeds considered in the analysis, between 60 and 100 km/h, is the most representative of in-service\nfreight trains. Also, the results show that including the Sparse Autoencoder has a positive\neffect in the normalization of the train speed in the damage data set.\nRegarding the severity classification for each type of damage, the methodology proved equally successful in clustering the different damage severities. For polygonal wheels, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the severity groups in terms of defect amplitude, failing only for the H6-8 harmonic cases, and in terms of harmonic orders for each amplitude,\nwith almost perfect results. For wheel flats, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the three severity groups, though with some misclassifications between the less severe group\nand baseline cases and between intermediate and severe cases. A success rate of around 86%\nis achieved in the classification of polygonal wheel severities and 84% in the classification of wheel flat severities. Even so, these high success rates of over 80% show the robustness\nof this methodology in damage classification regardless of the train speed.on on-site measurements. Additionally, this methodology could be carried out for other types of railway vehicles, for example, passenger vehicles, since the dynamic responses are\ndifferent from freight vehicles. In that case, exploring other recent types of autoencoders,\nTo increase the complexity of the problem, the objective is to explore the concept of\nmultiple damages (same or different OOR types). For this, it will be necessary to incorporate a new stage in the methodology, the damage location stage, which will make it possible\nto distinguish isolated damage from multiple damage, as well as their respective location.\nThus, damage will be identified using cut signals, which will then be used to classify theThis work is a result of project WAY4SafeRail-WAYside monitoring system FOR SAFE RAIL transportation, with reference NORTE-01-0247-FEDER-069595, co-funded by the European Regional\nDevelopment Fund (ERDF), through the North Portugal Regional Operational Programme\nPartnership Agreement.

Within this context,\nan unsupervised methodology based on artificial intelligence techniques is presented, which allows the detection and classification of wheels, based on dynamic responses induced on the track by crossing freight railway vehicles. The methodology involves the following\nsteps: (i) data collection and pre-processing, (ii) feature extraction (iii)\ndata fusion and (iv) feature discrimination. In the first phase, an FFT\nalgorithm is applied to the acceleration track responses. Then, features are extracted after training a Stacked Sparse Autoencoder, in which the main features of the responses are obtained after a compression stage using an encoder network.

Posteriorly, an outlier analysis is performed to distinguish a healthy wheelRail vehicle wheels are subjected to constant wear and tear due to continuous use and inadequate maintenance plans. Over time, this wear and tear can generate more significant defects, so it is extremely important to use sensing to understand when maintenance of both the track and rolling stock is required.

However, this type of system entail high costs envisaging the vehicle wheel condition monitoring, since sensors need to be installed in every vehicle in order to achieve a good representativity . On the other hand, wayside systems are a more viable solution for identifying wheel defects, since the condition of allThe most common wheel defects are known as OOR. As the name infers, this defect is related to deformations on the surface of the wheel circumference that make it not round.\nThis deformation can have many forms and different causes, leading to faults on the vehicle and on the track due to the higher dynamic force values [4–6]. The OOR damagesa function of their shape and size, vehicle characteristics and speed [7–10]. Wheel flats induce high dynamic impact loads on the railway infrastructure, which causes significant damage to both tracks and vehicles, such as broken axles, damaged rolling bearings and cracks in the wheels, rails and sleepers . Moreover, it also generates high vibrations\ntransmitted to the rolling stock, inducing significant stresses and causing damage to the In the case of polygonal wheels, the formation mechanism can be roughly classified\ninto three categories, namely, (1) initial wheel defects , (2) a natural vibration of the\nvehicle–track system and (3) thermoelastic instability . The formation mechanism is strongly contingent on the vehicle type and its operational characteristics, withof dominant harmonic orders [19–22]. For example, Tao et al. studied asymmetrical polygonal wear on metro wheels and obtained harmonic orders of 12–14, while another study by Tao et al. found that the most common harmonic order in Chinese freight trains is 18–19. Although a polygonal wheel could generate less impact on the track than a\nwheel flat, this defect can cause serious damage to the track due to resonance effects in the\nTo identify the occurrence of these OOR anomalies in train wheels, innovative\nmethodologies have been developed combining signal processing and automatic learning techniques. These methodologies are based on the extraction of damage sensitivity features, making possible the distinction between undamaged and damaged situations. Recently, many studies have shown good results in detecting OOR damages using\ndistinct approaches [24–29]. Mishra et al. concluded that a single FBG (Fiber Bragg Grating) sensor, positioned along the rail can detect the presence of wheel flats.\nLourenço et al. created an automatic algorithm for diagnosing OOR defects. The\nproposed methodology consists of isolating specific defective wheels and then identifying the severity of the damage, using only acceleration and strain data measured on\nthe track. In another study, Krummenacher et al. , proposed two machine-learningBy extracting the features, it is possible to transform the measured data into an alternative form of information where the correlation with damage is more easily observed. There are various techniques for feature extraction, the most common being CWT\n(continuous wavelet transform) [31–33], PCA (principal component analysis) ,detection of polygonal wheels on freight vehicles using CWT and ARX features, using\n6 accelerometers, 3 on each side of the railway track. Mosleh et al. introduced aflats by extracting AR features from acceleration records. Moreover, Mohammadi et al.\nadopted linear features, particularly, CWT, PCA, ARX and AR, and their research findingsin the context of wheel flat damage detection. Although these studies have demonstrated robust results in detection, they show some limitations in dealing with the non-linear effects associated with operational effects, such as the train speed. Due to the inability of these linear techniques to attenuate operation effects, the inclusion of different speeds\nFor most of these studies, a feature normalisation stage is used when it is necessary to remove the operational effects. Usually, latent variable methods are used, such as PCA or multiple linear regression (MLR) . Thus, to deal with the non-linear phenomena and reduce the large amounts of data without relying on the aforementioned methods,\nthe first artificial neural networks were created to inherently execute this task . Over the years, new and more advanced networks have been developed, with the Autoencoder\n(AE) being one of the main types. Later, Olshausen et al. proposed the creation of\nsparse coding and Ng et al. introduced a sparse penalisation term in the hidden layer,\nto acquire more compact and effective features from lower-dimensional data. For some datasets with complex relationships between characteristics, employing more than one SAE\nis necessary, which is why stacked sparse autoencoders (SSAE) are commonly used .\nNowadays, these types of AE are widely used in various scientific fields, but specifically\nfor structural engineering only a few studies are found, and most are about damage detection on bridges [45–47].

Including the track irregularities directly in the constraint equations are beneficial since it avoids explicitly considering\nthem in the FEM model. Moreover, it also allows to include the wheel and OOR profiles as a periodic rail irregularity, simplifying the analysis. Thus, before starting the analysis, the\nVSI software imports track irregularities and OOR profiles from a MATLAB file, whichto the vertical and lateral irregularities in each rail in each respective position, and adds it to the constraint equations of the system throughout the dynamics analysis. Then, the\nsystem of dynamic equations is solved using the typical Newmark integration method.\nThe impact of track irregularity on wheel defect classification is significant, as a lower track quality tends to result in a higher likelihood of misclassification. A comprehensive\nexploration of this influence was previously undertaken by Mosleh et al. as documented in their research study . Hence, this study does not delve into the impact of track\nquality; rather, it primarily centres on the utilisation of AI-based methodologies for the detection and classification of wheel defects. For this, four different profiles are used, based\non European Standard EN 13848–2 . In this case, power spectral density (PSD) curvesFor OOR defects, several profiles are defined based on real measurements in representative profiles of the various severities. Subsequently, the structural matrices are imported\nMore details on track and train properties, including additional information on traintrack interaction, can be found in previous publications . Figure 1 shows the\nvehicle–track interaction model schematisation and some details about the train and track\nsubsystems, as well as the track irregularities and wheel-rail contact model.According to the conclusions reached in other studies with this type of damage ,\nthe most promising location of the sensors is on the rail. To reduce installation and maintenance costs, it is important to reduce the number of sensors without compromising the\nquality of the results. Therefore, based on a sensitivity analysis performed during the study,\nonly two vertical unidirectional accelerometers were used on each rail, 4 in total (A1 to A4),\nsince they provided a higher cost–benefit ratio. These sensors are mounted on the rail atdefects, different simulation scenarios with perfect wheels (baseline) and OOR wheels\n(damage) were defined for a five-wagon Laagrss freight train. Based on different crossing speeds, loading schemes and rail irregularities profiles, 120 baseline and 180 damage scenarios (90 for polygonal wheels and 90 for wheel flats) were defined, as summarised in For baseline scenarios, six loading schemes with five different speeds (40, 60, 80, 100\nand 120 km/h) and four rail irregularity profiles were considered, giving a total of 120 scenarios. The loading schemes used are: empty, half-loaded, full-loaded and, additionally,For the damage cases, a total of 90 scenarios were generated for polygonal wheels. These\nscenarios including 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (H1, H2 and H3) x 10 different irregularity profiles within each specified harmonic interval. In these 10 irregularity\nprofiles, based on the defect amplitude, two amplitudes are considered, five simulations for\nA1 and five simulations for A2. Similarly, 90 scenarios were created for wheel flats, involving 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (F1, F2 and F3) x 10 different irregularitywheel radius . This wave phenomenon can be characterised by the different wavelengths formed (harmonics θ ), and by the levels of irregularity ( Lw ) associated with each of the harmonics. According to Peng , it is considered a polygonal wheel when the wear amplitude assumes values above 0. mm and wavelengths between 140 mm and the wheelTo define scenarios with polygonal wheels for the Laagrss wagon, a literature survey on\nexperimental measurements in defective wheels was conducted . Three experimental irregularity profiles were collected, illustrated in Figure 3. The first group (H6-8)\ncorresponds to a study carried out by Cai et al. with dominant harmonics from 6 to 8;**Figure 3.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) of polygonal wheels with**Figure 4.** Examples of polygonal damage profiles for each of the dominant harmonic intervals.the second group (H12-14) to a study authored by Tao et al. with dominant harmonics from 12 to 14; and the third profile (H17-18) to a study performed by Wu et al. with\nBased on the wheel irregularity spectra ( Lw ) taken from the respective measurement profiles, shown in Figure 3, and considering the contribution of the first 30 harmonics, several irregularity profiles were generated, according to Figure 4.

After obtaining the acceleration measurements from the numerical simulations, an FFT algorithm is applied to the time series allowing the conversion of the signal from the time domain to the frequency domain. Then,predefined hyperparameters of the algorithm. The set hyperparameters are encoding and\ndecoding transfer functions, hidden layer size, maximum number of epochs, L2 weight regularisation term, sparsity regularisation term and a sparsity proportion term. Afterwards,**Figure 7.** Flowchart with the main phases of the methodology for detection and classification of OORthe features are extracted in the more compressed layer of the SAE, the so-called bottleneck layer. The number of features obtained is equal to the number of hidden layers which\nis usually considerably lower than the data size, allowing a compression of the input data.\nFurthermore, to enhance the sensitivity to damage, two levels of data fusion are applied to the bottleneck features using the Mahalanobis distance. In the first level, all features are\nfused into a damage index (DI) for each sensor and, in the second level, all the sensors\nare merged resulting in only one DI for each simulation. Finally, automatic damage detection is achieved by performing an outlier analysis, in which a statistical confidence limit\n(CB) is used, based on the Inverse Cumulative Gaussian Distribution Function (ICDF).\nFor feature classification, an automatic clustering process based on the k-means technique is implemented. This algorithm allows for the unsupervised and automatic classification of data, based on the calculation of statistical distances between objects. In k-means technique given a vector of data and chosen k clusters, the key is to find k centroids that minimise\nthe distance of each vector to its nearest centroid . Since it is necessary to define the number of clusters in advance, a global Silhouette index (SIL) was adopted to make\nan automatic process. At the end, the clusters will allow the classification of the two typesbetween the number of correct classifications and the total number of cases.damage detection problems, as it allows a signal to be converted from the time domain to the frequency domain, to capture the excitation frequencies induced by the wheel defects.\nIn addition, a data reduction is carried out at this stage, since the initial records contain aa crossing speed of 80 km/h. When comparing the FFT spectra for a train passage with flats, Figure 8a), with polygonal wheels, Figure 8b), there are visible differences in terms\nof amplitude peak values and excited frequency ranges. For flats, the amplitude peak values are higher and they induce frequencies in the range between DC and 1500accordance with some authors reports . In terms of severities, for flats, the more severe group (55–100 mm) is the one with the higher frequency content, as expected,a baseline response. For polygonal wheels, from the analysis of Figure 8b), it can be seen the frequency peaks for the H12–14 and H17–18 profiles around 100 and 150\nrespectively, while for the profile H6-8 a more flat spectrum is obtained without showing any significant peak. This can be explained by the irregularity level profile of thisThese two graphs can show which frequencies have higher content in the original signal.Autoencoders are artificial neural networks trained using an unsupervised approach,\nwhich aim first to learn coded representations of the data, compressing the input into\na latent space representation, and second, through this compressed information, reconstructing the information. The basic architecture of this type of network consists of threewhere **Wij**, **Wjk** are the weights connection matrices between input layer-hidden\nlayer and hidden layer-output layer, **X** = ( **X** 1, **X** 2, . . ., **Xn** ) is the input data vector,\n**H** = ( **H** 1, . . ., **Hm** ) is the low-dimensional vector and **X** [ˆ] = ( **X** [ˆ] 1, **X** [ˆ] 2, . . ., **X** [ˆ] **n** ) is the output**Figure 8.** Frequency domain responses on position 1 for the crossing speed of 80 km/h: (a) wheel flats,data vector. **b** 1, **b** 2 are bias vectors and σ 1, σ 2 are the activation function used in each of thereconstruction of the input X [ˆ], as shown in Equation (3).

After incorporating various inputs into the SSAE training, they are integrated into the so-called\n‘Input 1’. As training progresses, the data is compressed, and the main characteristics of the signals are obtained and retained in ‘Bottleneck 1’. Subsequently, these characteristics are\nused as input for training the second sparse autoencoder, which, after further compression,\nenables the extraction of the final features. Depending on the type of data under analysis,\nthe compression level differs, so multiple tests should be conducted to optimise these layer sizes. This optimisation was achieved by trial and test, changing both the size of the first\nIt should be noted that this network architecture, where the dimensions of the layers gradually decrease along the network until reaching the bottleneck layer , has proven\nto be highly robust for the type of data used. It allows for effective compression of results**Figure 9.** Schematic of the structure of the SSAE neural network used in this study.After extracting the features from the bottleneck layer of the SSAE, the difference between the healthy wheels scenarios and the damage wheels scenarios is still not sufficient. Hence\na data fusion is performed. With this fusion, it is possible to increase the sensitivity of the\nfeatures, and as a result, to obtain a damage index (DI) for each simulation. Thus, the Mahalanobis distance (MD) is used to reduce the volume of extracted data and preserve the most relevant information . Briefly, MD is a metric that measures the distance between two points in a feature space consisting of two or more variables, being independent of the\nscale of the features, thus allowing an increase in the sensitivity of the features to cases with damage. The MD, denoted here as DI, is calculated for each simulation using the followingin which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−], and ¯ x is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The MD is calculated for each sensor and for each simulation, obtaining a matrix of n distances per k number of sensors.Finally, the discrimination of the features consists in distinguishing the features as corresponding to a healthy or damaged case. At this stage of the methodology, an analysis of\nabnormal values is carried out, which will allow the condition of the train wheels to beautomatically monitored and these values to be classified into different classes. This phaseThe outlier analysis consists of grouping, by probabilistic distribution processes, the datato the previously created group. For this, a statistical confidence limit (CB) is used, based on the inverse cumulative Gaussian distribution function (ICDF), considering the mean\nvalue, ¯ μ, and standard deviation, σ, of the baseline feature vector.Whenever a value of a DI indicator is equal to or greater than CB, it is considered an outlier (the null hypothesis is rejected), thus representing a case of damage.For feature classification, a clustering process is used to divide the dataset into distinct clusters that should be as compact and separated as possible . For clustering, the k-meanson the distances of their vectors. Recent studies showed that the k-means algorithm has shown promising results . The main limitation of this technique is that it requires\nknowledge of the number of clusters in advance. For this purpose, the global silhouetteThis section presents the main results obtained through the application of the methodology proposed in section 3 to the calculated track responses. The methodology is applied using damaged wheel passages for the three simulated train speeds (60, 80 and 100 km/h),hyperparameters (presented in section 3). By adjusting these hyperparameters, it is possible to make the algorithm more efficient and improve the generalisation capabilities, as only\nthe most important features are retained. The optimisation of these hyperparameters isof data under analysis. Based on the principles of the SAE already outlined in other works\nIn the context of this study, the non-linear transfer functions (logsig) proved to be more effective than the linear ones, being the ones used in all the studied cases. After analysing Table 3, there is a similarity in the hyperparameters when comparing the two types of OOR damage. It is observed that the data compression level is the same for both cases, around\n93%, as 500 features are extracted in Bottleneck 2 from the initial input data with 7000\nConcerning the type of damage situation, the size of the ‘Bottleneck 1’ and ‘Bottleneck\n2’ was increased to bring them even closer to the initial amount of input data. This can beanalysis, making it challenging for the autoencoder to define relationships between the data, hence requiring a larger number. On the contrary, the maximum number of epochsIt is also important to emphasise that of the various hyperparameters presented, theOnce the hyperparameters have been defined, all the steps of the methodology are applied to the new dataset. For simplicity, in this section, only the last phase of the methodology will be presented, namely an outlier analysis for damage detection and cluster analysis for damage classification. For each sensor, a matrix n × m is created, where n\nis the number of test passages (baseline scenarios + damage scenarios), and m represents the number of extracted features. So, the size of the matrices is 210 × 2000 in case of the\ntype of damage, 75 × 500 for each amplitude in polygonal wheel, and 120 × 500 for wheelDespite the visual distinction between healthy and damaged wheels based on the data processing presented in subsection 3.2, unsupervised learning must use strategies capable of automatically detecting damage. To this end, an outlier analysis is employed, which consists of defining a confidence threshold using a significance level of 1% , represented**Figure 10.** Automatic OOR damage detection based on outlier analysis.by the green line in Figure 10. This approach makes it possible to successfully detect allTo distinguish the two types of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed. Figure 11\nshows a clear distinction between the damage, even when using a dataset with three different train speeds (60,80 and 100 km/h).. In the case of Figure 11a), using all four\naccelerometers, it is possible to efficiently separate the set into two large clusters, despite\n30 misclassifications (16 in the polygonisation and 14 in the flats). Even so, the accuracy\npercentage is around 85%, which is a very good result. To analyse the sensitivity to the number of sensors, only two sensors were used, one on each side ). The results\nimproved, with a decrease in the number of misclassifications from 30 to 21 (13 for polygonisation and 8 for flats). One explanation could be the disparity in sensor sensitivity to the damage, where some sensors are more sensitive than others due to their spatial positioning in relation to the damage. By merging the data from the less sensitive sensors with the\nmore sensitive ones, this could have a negative impact on the results. Thus, the percentage\nThe purpose behind presenting these two plots was to demonstrate that, whether using 4 sensors or 2 sensors, the classification remains remarkably robust, showing lowAfter identifying the type of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed once again to\nclassify the severity of each damage separately. Regarding polygonal wheels, the classification involves both amplitude and harmonic orders, leading to the clusters depicted in the obtained clusters reasonably reflect the two amplitude groups, with all misclassifications associated with the H6-8 harmonic cases (17 misclassifications). Once the amplitude\nis identified, harmonic classification must be carried out separately for each of the amplitudes. In Figure 12b), related to amplitude A1, it is observed that the obtained clusters**Figure 11.** Automatic OOR damage classification based on cluster analysis using: a) 4 sensors; b) 2are nearly perfect, with only 3 misclassifications. In Figure 12c), there are only 3 misclassifications, totalling 8 misclassifications in the classification of the number of dominant\nThe classification of harmonic order is only possible with the separation of amplitudes,\nFigure 13 presents the clusters obtained for the wheel flat cases. The separation between\nthe less severe group and baseline cases and intermediate (cluster 3) and severe cases (cluster 4) is reduced, resulting in a total of 19 misclassifications. Nevertheless, this result showsrate of about 84%. One possible reason for this significant number of misclassifications could be directly associated with the number of impacts captured by the sensor.In order to contribute to the safety of railway transportation and service quality, an automatic methodology based on machine learning has been proposed. This methodology can accurately detect and classify two types of OOR wheel damage in railway vehicles allowing to mitigate problems at both track and vehicle level, such as derailments or material\ndegradation. It includes a new technique for feature extraction based on a dedicated neural network, the Sparse Autoencoder. This non-linear technique is an upgrade concerning the commonly used linear techniques for feature extraction since it allows a better normalisation of the operational effects in the analysed data, as well as the reduction of large amounts\nof data without relying on other techniques, while keeping the most valuable information. These improvements are achieved through the use of different hyperparameters in**Figure 12.** Automatic classification of polygonal wheels based on cluster analysis: a) amplitude A1-A2;**Figure 13.** Automatic classification of wheel flats based on cluster analysis.the calculations, such as non-linear activation functions and sparsity terms. Consequently,circulation. Particularly in the railway engineering field, the inclusion of this technique\nshowed a good potential to deal with variable train speeds, essentially due to the amplifying effect on the measured track dynamic responses which could induce errors in damage The application of the methodology to the data set proved to be very successful in detecting and classifying the two types of OOR damages. Damage detection was perfect, without\nany false detection. In terms of classifying the type of damage, the results are very good,\nwith a success rate of around 85%, but if only two accelerometers are considered the successrate increases to around 90%. These results are encouraging since the range of speeds considered in the analysis, between 60 and 100 km/h, is the most representative of in-service\nfreight trains. Also, the results show that including the Sparse Autoencoder has a positive\neffect in the normalization of the train speed in the damage data set.\nRegarding the severity classification for each type of damage, the methodology proved equally successful in clustering the different damage severities. For polygonal wheels, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the severity groups in terms of defect amplitude, failing only for the H6-8 harmonic cases, and in terms of harmonic orders for each amplitude,\nwith almost perfect results. For wheel flats, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the three severity groups, though with some misclassifications between the less severe group\nand baseline cases and between intermediate and severe cases. A success rate of around 86%\nis achieved in the classification of polygonal wheel severities and 84% in the classification of wheel flat severities. Even so, these high success rates of over 80% show the robustness\nof this methodology in damage classification regardless of the train speed.on on-site measurements. Additionally, this methodology could be carried out for other types of railway vehicles, for example, passenger vehicles, since the dynamic responses are\ndifferent from freight vehicles. In that case, exploring other recent types of autoencoders,\nTo increase the complexity of the problem, the objective is to explore the concept of\nmultiple damages (same or different OOR types). For this, it will be necessary to incorporate a new stage in the methodology, the damage location stage, which will make it possible\nto distinguish isolated damage from multiple damage, as well as their respective location.\nThus, damage will be identified using cut signals, which will then be used to classify theThis work is a result of project WAY4SafeRail-WAYside monitoring system FOR SAFE RAIL transportation, with reference NORTE-01-0247-FEDER-069595, co-funded by the European Regional\nDevelopment Fund (ERDF), through the North Portugal Regional Operational Programme\nPartnership Agreement.

Within this context,\nan unsupervised methodology based on artificial intelligence techniques is presented, which allows the detection and classification of wheels, based on dynamic responses induced on the track by crossing freight railway vehicles. The methodology involves the following\nsteps: (i) data collection and pre-processing, (ii) feature extraction (iii)\ndata fusion and (iv) feature discrimination. In the first phase, an FFT\nalgorithm is applied to the acceleration track responses. Then, features are extracted after training a Stacked Sparse Autoencoder, in which the main features of the responses are obtained after a compression stage using an encoder network. This lower dimensional\nlayer forces the model to learn a compression of the input data. Then,\nwhich enhances the sensitivity to the damage recognition. Posteriorly, an outlier analysis is performed to distinguish a healthy wheelRail vehicle wheels are subjected to constant wear and tear due to continuous use and inadequate maintenance plans. Over time, this wear and tear can generate more significant defects, so it is extremely important to use sensing to understand when maintenance of both the track and rolling stock is required.

However, this type of system entail high costs envisaging the vehicle wheel condition monitoring, since sensors need to be installed in every vehicle in order to achieve a good representativity . On the other hand, wayside systems are a more viable solution for identifying wheel defects, since the condition of allThe most common wheel defects are known as OOR. As the name infers, this defect is related to deformations on the surface of the wheel circumference that make it not round.\nThis deformation can have many forms and different causes, leading to faults on the vehicle and on the track due to the higher dynamic force values [4–6]. The OOR damagesa function of their shape and size, vehicle characteristics and speed [7–10]. Wheel flats induce high dynamic impact loads on the railway infrastructure, which causes significant damage to both tracks and vehicles, such as broken axles, damaged rolling bearings and cracks in the wheels, rails and sleepers . Moreover, it also generates high vibrations\ntransmitted to the rolling stock, inducing significant stresses and causing damage to the In the case of polygonal wheels, the formation mechanism can be roughly classified\ninto three categories, namely, (1) initial wheel defects , (2) a natural vibration of the\nvehicle–track system and (3) thermoelastic instability . The formation mechanism is strongly contingent on the vehicle type and its operational characteristics, withof dominant harmonic orders [19–22]. For example, Tao et al. studied asymmetrical polygonal wear on metro wheels and obtained harmonic orders of 12–14, while another study by Tao et al. found that the most common harmonic order in Chinese freight trains is 18–19. Although a polygonal wheel could generate less impact on the track than a\nwheel flat, this defect can cause serious damage to the track due to resonance effects in the\nTo identify the occurrence of these OOR anomalies in train wheels, innovative\nmethodologies have been developed combining signal processing and automatic learning techniques. These methodologies are based on the extraction of damage sensitivity features, making possible the distinction between undamaged and damaged situations. Recently, many studies have shown good results in detecting OOR damages using\ndistinct approaches [24–29]. Mishra et al. concluded that a single FBG (Fiber Bragg Grating) sensor, positioned along the rail can detect the presence of wheel flats.\nLourenço et al. created an automatic algorithm for diagnosing OOR defects. The\nproposed methodology consists of isolating specific defective wheels and then identifying the severity of the damage, using only acceleration and strain data measured on\nthe track. In another study, Krummenacher et al. , proposed two machine-learningBy extracting the features, it is possible to transform the measured data into an alternative form of information where the correlation with damage is more easily observed. There are various techniques for feature extraction, the most common being CWT\n(continuous wavelet transform) [31–33], PCA (principal component analysis) ,detection of polygonal wheels on freight vehicles using CWT and ARX features, using\n6 accelerometers, 3 on each side of the railway track. Mosleh et al. introduced aflats by extracting AR features from acceleration records. Moreover, Mohammadi et al.\nadopted linear features, particularly, CWT, PCA, ARX and AR, and their research findingsin the context of wheel flat damage detection. Although these studies have demonstrated robust results in detection, they show some limitations in dealing with the non-linear effects associated with operational effects, such as the train speed. Due to the inability of these linear techniques to attenuate operation effects, the inclusion of different speeds\nFor most of these studies, a feature normalisation stage is used when it is necessary to remove the operational effects. Usually, latent variable methods are used, such as PCA or multiple linear regression (MLR) . Thus, to deal with the non-linear phenomena and reduce the large amounts of data without relying on the aforementioned methods,\nthe first artificial neural networks were created to inherently execute this task . Over the years, new and more advanced networks have been developed, with the Autoencoder\n(AE) being one of the main types. Later, Olshausen et al. proposed the creation of\nsparse coding and Ng et al. introduced a sparse penalisation term in the hidden layer,\nto acquire more compact and effective features from lower-dimensional data. For some datasets with complex relationships between characteristics, employing more than one SAE\nis necessary, which is why stacked sparse autoencoders (SSAE) are commonly used .\nNowadays, these types of AE are widely used in various scientific fields, but specifically\nfor structural engineering only a few studies are found, and most are about damage detection on bridges [45–47].

Pathirage et al. proposed a framework utilizing SAE’s potential for dimensionality reduction, which facilitated the assessment of damage detection performance on Many of these AE algorithms already performed feature classification in order to discriminate the different types of damages and severities. However, the AE methods can also be combined with other techniques commonly used to classify the data. They can be used unsupervised methods, in which the model is trained without any labels provided to the\ntraining dataset, such as k-means , self-organising maps (SOM) , isolation forest, gaussian mixture model , k-medoids and cluster analysis , or supervised\nmethods, which assume that the hierarchy of database categories is known, such as NaiveBayes classifiers , k-Nearest Neighbours classifiers , Support Vector Machinetwo types of OOR damages, flats and polygonal wheels, based on acceleration responses obtained from a virtual wayside monitoring system.

The application of sensors on both sides of theTo obtain the responses from the railway track, it is necessary to apply sensors on the track that can measure the dynamic responses of the crossing trains. As it is not always possible\nto install them due to the high costs involved, simulations have been carried out based on calibrated models of the track , vehicle and considering their dynamic interaction,\nas well as including the track irregularities. Simulations include cases with healthy wheelsTo simulate the dynamic interactions between the vehicle and the track, an in-house software VSI – Vehicle-Structure Interaction Analysis is used, which was initially developed by\nNeves et al. and later improved by Montenegro et al. .

Including the track irregularities directly in the constraint equations are beneficial since it avoids explicitly considering\nthem in the FEM model. Moreover, it also allows to include the wheel and OOR profiles as a periodic rail irregularity, simplifying the analysis. Thus, before starting the analysis, the\nVSI software imports track irregularities and OOR profiles from a MATLAB file, whichto the vertical and lateral irregularities in each rail in each respective position, and adds it to the constraint equations of the system throughout the dynamics analysis. Then, the\nsystem of dynamic equations is solved using the typical Newmark integration method.\nThe impact of track irregularity on wheel defect classification is significant, as a lower track quality tends to result in a higher likelihood of misclassification. A comprehensive\nexploration of this influence was previously undertaken by Mosleh et al. as documented in their research study . Hence, this study does not delve into the impact of track\nquality; rather, it primarily centres on the utilisation of AI-based methodologies for the detection and classification of wheel defects. For this, four different profiles are used, based\non European Standard EN 13848–2 .

Subsequently, the structural matrices are imported\nMore details on track and train properties, including additional information on traintrack interaction, can be found in previous publications . Figure 1 shows the\nvehicle–track interaction model schematisation and some details about the train and track\nsubsystems, as well as the track irregularities and wheel-rail contact model.According to the conclusions reached in other studies with this type of damage ,\nthe most promising location of the sensors is on the rail. To reduce installation and maintenance costs, it is important to reduce the number of sensors without compromising the\nquality of the results. Therefore, based on a sensitivity analysis performed during the study,\nonly two vertical unidirectional accelerometers were used on each rail, 4 in total (A1 to A4),\nsince they provided a higher cost–benefit ratio. These sensors are mounted on the rail atdefects, different simulation scenarios with perfect wheels (baseline) and OOR wheels\n(damage) were defined for a five-wagon Laagrss freight train. Based on different crossing speeds, loading schemes and rail irregularities profiles, 120 baseline and 180 damage scenarios (90 for polygonal wheels and 90 for wheel flats) were defined, as summarised in For baseline scenarios, six loading schemes with five different speeds (40, 60, 80, 100\nand 120 km/h) and four rail irregularity profiles were considered, giving a total of 120 scenarios. The loading schemes used are: empty, half-loaded, full-loaded and, additionally,For the damage cases, a total of 90 scenarios were generated for polygonal wheels. These\nscenarios including 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (H1, H2 and H3) x 10 different irregularity profiles within each specified harmonic interval. In these 10 irregularity\nprofiles, based on the defect amplitude, two amplitudes are considered, five simulations for\nA1 and five simulations for A2. Similarly, 90 scenarios were created for wheel flats, involving 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (F1, F2 and F3) x 10 different irregularitywheel radius . This wave phenomenon can be characterised by the different wavelengths formed (harmonics θ ), and by the levels of irregularity ( Lw ) associated with each of the harmonics. According to Peng , it is considered a polygonal wheel when the wear amplitude assumes values above 0. mm and wavelengths between 140 mm and the wheelTo define scenarios with polygonal wheels for the Laagrss wagon, a literature survey on\nexperimental measurements in defective wheels was conducted . Three experimental irregularity profiles were collected, illustrated in Figure 3. The first group (H6-8)\ncorresponds to a study carried out by Cai et al. with dominant harmonics from 6 to 8;**Figure 3.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) of polygonal wheels with**Figure 4.** Examples of polygonal damage profiles for each of the dominant harmonic intervals.the second group (H12-14) to a study authored by Tao et al. with dominant harmonics from 12 to 14; and the third profile (H17-18) to a study performed by Wu et al. with\nBased on the wheel irregularity spectra ( Lw ) taken from the respective measurement profiles, shown in Figure 3, and considering the contribution of the first 30 harmonics, several irregularity profiles were generated, according to Figure 4.

Then,predefined hyperparameters of the algorithm. The set hyperparameters are encoding and\ndecoding transfer functions, hidden layer size, maximum number of epochs, L2 weight regularisation term, sparsity regularisation term and a sparsity proportion term. Afterwards,**Figure 7.** Flowchart with the main phases of the methodology for detection and classification of OORthe features are extracted in the more compressed layer of the SAE, the so-called bottleneck layer. The number of features obtained is equal to the number of hidden layers which\nis usually considerably lower than the data size, allowing a compression of the input data.\nFurthermore, to enhance the sensitivity to damage, two levels of data fusion are applied to the bottleneck features using the Mahalanobis distance. In the first level, all features are\nfused into a damage index (DI) for each sensor and, in the second level, all the sensors\nare merged resulting in only one DI for each simulation. Finally, automatic damage detection is achieved by performing an outlier analysis, in which a statistical confidence limit\n(CB) is used, based on the Inverse Cumulative Gaussian Distribution Function (ICDF).\nFor feature classification, an automatic clustering process based on the k-means technique is implemented. This algorithm allows for the unsupervised and automatic classification of data, based on the calculation of statistical distances between objects. In k-means technique given a vector of data and chosen k clusters, the key is to find k centroids that minimise\nthe distance of each vector to its nearest centroid . Since it is necessary to define the number of clusters in advance, a global Silhouette index (SIL) was adopted to make\nan automatic process. At the end, the clusters will allow the classification of the two typesbetween the number of correct classifications and the total number of cases.damage detection problems, as it allows a signal to be converted from the time domain to the frequency domain, to capture the excitation frequencies induced by the wheel defects.\nIn addition, a data reduction is carried out at this stage, since the initial records contain aa crossing speed of 80 km/h. When comparing the FFT spectra for a train passage with flats, Figure 8a), with polygonal wheels, Figure 8b), there are visible differences in terms\nof amplitude peak values and excited frequency ranges. For flats, the amplitude peak values are higher and they induce frequencies in the range between DC and 1500accordance with some authors reports . In terms of severities, for flats, the more severe group (55–100 mm) is the one with the higher frequency content, as expected,a baseline response. For polygonal wheels, from the analysis of Figure 8b), it can be seen the frequency peaks for the H12–14 and H17–18 profiles around 100 and 150\nrespectively, while for the profile H6-8 a more flat spectrum is obtained without showing any significant peak. This can be explained by the irregularity level profile of thisThese two graphs can show which frequencies have higher content in the original signal.Autoencoders are artificial neural networks trained using an unsupervised approach,\nwhich aim first to learn coded representations of the data, compressing the input into\na latent space representation, and second, through this compressed information, reconstructing the information. The basic architecture of this type of network consists of threewhere **Wij**, **Wjk** are the weights connection matrices between input layer-hidden\nlayer and hidden layer-output layer, **X** = ( **X** 1, **X** 2, . . ., **Xn** ) is the input data vector,\n**H** = ( **H** 1, . . ., **Hm** ) is the low-dimensional vector and **X** [ˆ] = ( **X** [ˆ] 1, **X** [ˆ] 2, . . ., **X** [ˆ] **n** ) is the output**Figure 8.** Frequency domain responses on position 1 for the crossing speed of 80 km/h: (a) wheel flats,data vector. **b** 1, **b** 2 are bias vectors and σ 1, σ 2 are the activation function used in each of thereconstruction of the input X [ˆ], as shown in Equation (3).

After incorporating various inputs into the SSAE training, they are integrated into the so-called\n‘Input 1’. As training progresses, the data is compressed, and the main characteristics of the signals are obtained and retained in ‘Bottleneck 1’. Subsequently, these characteristics are\nused as input for training the second sparse autoencoder, which, after further compression,\nenables the extraction of the final features. Depending on the type of data under analysis,\nthe compression level differs, so multiple tests should be conducted to optimise these layer sizes. This optimisation was achieved by trial and test, changing both the size of the first\nIt should be noted that this network architecture, where the dimensions of the layers gradually decrease along the network until reaching the bottleneck layer , has proven\nto be highly robust for the type of data used. It allows for effective compression of results**Figure 9.** Schematic of the structure of the SSAE neural network used in this study.After extracting the features from the bottleneck layer of the SSAE, the difference between the healthy wheels scenarios and the damage wheels scenarios is still not sufficient. Hence\na data fusion is performed. With this fusion, it is possible to increase the sensitivity of the\nfeatures, and as a result, to obtain a damage index (DI) for each simulation. Thus, the Mahalanobis distance (MD) is used to reduce the volume of extracted data and preserve the most relevant information . Briefly, MD is a metric that measures the distance between two points in a feature space consisting of two or more variables, being independent of the\nscale of the features, thus allowing an increase in the sensitivity of the features to cases with damage. The MD, denoted here as DI, is calculated for each simulation using the followingin which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−], and ¯ x is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The MD is calculated for each sensor and for each simulation, obtaining a matrix of n distances per k number of sensors.Finally, the discrimination of the features consists in distinguishing the features as corresponding to a healthy or damaged case. At this stage of the methodology, an analysis of\nabnormal values is carried out, which will allow the condition of the train wheels to beautomatically monitored and these values to be classified into different classes. This phaseThe outlier analysis consists of grouping, by probabilistic distribution processes, the datato the previously created group. For this, a statistical confidence limit (CB) is used, based on the inverse cumulative Gaussian distribution function (ICDF), considering the mean\nvalue, ¯ μ, and standard deviation, σ, of the baseline feature vector.Whenever a value of a DI indicator is equal to or greater than CB, it is considered an outlier (the null hypothesis is rejected), thus representing a case of damage.For feature classification, a clustering process is used to divide the dataset into distinct clusters that should be as compact and separated as possible . For clustering, the k-meanson the distances of their vectors. Recent studies showed that the k-means algorithm has shown promising results . The main limitation of this technique is that it requires\nknowledge of the number of clusters in advance. For this purpose, the global silhouetteThis section presents the main results obtained through the application of the methodology proposed in section 3 to the calculated track responses. The methodology is applied using damaged wheel passages for the three simulated train speeds (60, 80 and 100 km/h),hyperparameters (presented in section 3). By adjusting these hyperparameters, it is possible to make the algorithm more efficient and improve the generalisation capabilities, as only\nthe most important features are retained. The optimisation of these hyperparameters isof data under analysis. Based on the principles of the SAE already outlined in other works\nIn the context of this study, the non-linear transfer functions (logsig) proved to be more effective than the linear ones, being the ones used in all the studied cases. After analysing Table 3, there is a similarity in the hyperparameters when comparing the two types of OOR damage. It is observed that the data compression level is the same for both cases, around\n93%, as 500 features are extracted in Bottleneck 2 from the initial input data with 7000\nConcerning the type of damage situation, the size of the ‘Bottleneck 1’ and ‘Bottleneck\n2’ was increased to bring them even closer to the initial amount of input data. This can beanalysis, making it challenging for the autoencoder to define relationships between the data, hence requiring a larger number. On the contrary, the maximum number of epochsIt is also important to emphasise that of the various hyperparameters presented, theOnce the hyperparameters have been defined, all the steps of the methodology are applied to the new dataset. For simplicity, in this section, only the last phase of the methodology will be presented, namely an outlier analysis for damage detection and cluster analysis for damage classification. For each sensor, a matrix n × m is created, where n\nis the number of test passages (baseline scenarios + damage scenarios), and m represents the number of extracted features. So, the size of the matrices is 210 × 2000 in case of the\ntype of damage, 75 × 500 for each amplitude in polygonal wheel, and 120 × 500 for wheelDespite the visual distinction between healthy and damaged wheels based on the data processing presented in subsection 3.2, unsupervised learning must use strategies capable of automatically detecting damage. To this end, an outlier analysis is employed, which consists of defining a confidence threshold using a significance level of 1% , represented**Figure 10.** Automatic OOR damage detection based on outlier analysis.by the green line in Figure 10. This approach makes it possible to successfully detect allTo distinguish the two types of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed. Figure 11\nshows a clear distinction between the damage, even when using a dataset with three different train speeds (60,80 and 100 km/h).. In the case of Figure 11a), using all four\naccelerometers, it is possible to efficiently separate the set into two large clusters, despite\n30 misclassifications (16 in the polygonisation and 14 in the flats). Even so, the accuracy\npercentage is around 85%, which is a very good result. To analyse the sensitivity to the number of sensors, only two sensors were used, one on each side ). The results\nimproved, with a decrease in the number of misclassifications from 30 to 21 (13 for polygonisation and 8 for flats). One explanation could be the disparity in sensor sensitivity to the damage, where some sensors are more sensitive than others due to their spatial positioning in relation to the damage. By merging the data from the less sensitive sensors with the\nmore sensitive ones, this could have a negative impact on the results. Thus, the percentage\nThe purpose behind presenting these two plots was to demonstrate that, whether using 4 sensors or 2 sensors, the classification remains remarkably robust, showing lowAfter identifying the type of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed once again to\nclassify the severity of each damage separately. Regarding polygonal wheels, the classification involves both amplitude and harmonic orders, leading to the clusters depicted in the obtained clusters reasonably reflect the two amplitude groups, with all misclassifications associated with the H6-8 harmonic cases (17 misclassifications). Once the amplitude\nis identified, harmonic classification must be carried out separately for each of the amplitudes. In Figure 12b), related to amplitude A1, it is observed that the obtained clusters**Figure 11.** Automatic OOR damage classification based on cluster analysis using: a) 4 sensors; b) 2are nearly perfect, with only 3 misclassifications. In Figure 12c), there are only 3 misclassifications, totalling 8 misclassifications in the classification of the number of dominant\nThe classification of harmonic order is only possible with the separation of amplitudes,\nFigure 13 presents the clusters obtained for the wheel flat cases. The separation between\nthe less severe group and baseline cases and intermediate (cluster 3) and severe cases (cluster 4) is reduced, resulting in a total of 19 misclassifications. Nevertheless, this result showsrate of about 84%. One possible reason for this significant number of misclassifications could be directly associated with the number of impacts captured by the sensor.In order to contribute to the safety of railway transportation and service quality, an automatic methodology based on machine learning has been proposed. This methodology can accurately detect and classify two types of OOR wheel damage in railway vehicles allowing to mitigate problems at both track and vehicle level, such as derailments or material\ndegradation. It includes a new technique for feature extraction based on a dedicated neural network, the Sparse Autoencoder. This non-linear technique is an upgrade concerning the commonly used linear techniques for feature extraction since it allows a better normalisation of the operational effects in the analysed data, as well as the reduction of large amounts\nof data without relying on other techniques, while keeping the most valuable information. These improvements are achieved through the use of different hyperparameters in**Figure 12.** Automatic classification of polygonal wheels based on cluster analysis: a) amplitude A1-A2;**Figure 13.** Automatic classification of wheel flats based on cluster analysis.the calculations, such as non-linear activation functions and sparsity terms. Consequently,circulation. Particularly in the railway engineering field, the inclusion of this technique\nshowed a good potential to deal with variable train speeds, essentially due to the amplifying effect on the measured track dynamic responses which could induce errors in damage The application of the methodology to the data set proved to be very successful in detecting and classifying the two types of OOR damages. Damage detection was perfect, without\nany false detection. In terms of classifying the type of damage, the results are very good,\nwith a success rate of around 85%, but if only two accelerometers are considered the successrate increases to around 90%. These results are encouraging since the range of speeds considered in the analysis, between 60 and 100 km/h, is the most representative of in-service\nfreight trains. Also, the results show that including the Sparse Autoencoder has a positive\neffect in the normalization of the train speed in the damage data set.\nRegarding the severity classification for each type of damage, the methodology proved equally successful in clustering the different damage severities. For polygonal wheels, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the severity groups in terms of defect amplitude, failing only for the H6-8 harmonic cases, and in terms of harmonic orders for each amplitude,\nwith almost perfect results. For wheel flats, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the three severity groups, though with some misclassifications between the less severe group\nand baseline cases and between intermediate and severe cases. A success rate of around 86%\nis achieved in the classification of polygonal wheel severities and 84% in the classification of wheel flat severities.

Within this context,\nan unsupervised methodology based on artificial intelligence techniques is presented, which allows the detection and classification of wheels, based on dynamic responses induced on the track by crossing freight railway vehicles. The methodology involves the following\nsteps: (i) data collection and pre-processing, (ii) feature extraction (iii)\ndata fusion and (iv) feature discrimination. In the first phase, an FFT\nalgorithm is applied to the acceleration track responses. Then, features are extracted after training a Stacked Sparse Autoencoder, in which the main features of the responses are obtained after a compression stage using an encoder network. This lower dimensional\nlayer forces the model to learn a compression of the input data. Then,\nwhich enhances the sensitivity to the damage recognition. Posteriorly, an outlier analysis is performed to distinguish a healthy wheelRail vehicle wheels are subjected to constant wear and tear due to continuous use and inadequate maintenance plans. Over time, this wear and tear can generate more significant defects, so it is extremely important to use sensing to understand when maintenance of both the track and rolling stock is required.

However, this type of system entail high costs envisaging the vehicle wheel condition monitoring, since sensors need to be installed in every vehicle in order to achieve a good representativity . On the other hand, wayside systems are a more viable solution for identifying wheel defects, since the condition of allThe most common wheel defects are known as OOR. As the name infers, this defect is related to deformations on the surface of the wheel circumference that make it not round.\nThis deformation can have many forms and different causes, leading to faults on the vehicle and on the track due to the higher dynamic force values [4–6]. The OOR damagesa function of their shape and size, vehicle characteristics and speed [7–10]. Wheel flats induce high dynamic impact loads on the railway infrastructure, which causes significant damage to both tracks and vehicles, such as broken axles, damaged rolling bearings and cracks in the wheels, rails and sleepers . Moreover, it also generates high vibrations\ntransmitted to the rolling stock, inducing significant stresses and causing damage to the In the case of polygonal wheels, the formation mechanism can be roughly classified\ninto three categories, namely, (1) initial wheel defects , (2) a natural vibration of the\nvehicle–track system and (3) thermoelastic instability . The formation mechanism is strongly contingent on the vehicle type and its operational characteristics, withof dominant harmonic orders [19–22]. For example, Tao et al. studied asymmetrical polygonal wear on metro wheels and obtained harmonic orders of 12–14, while another study by Tao et al. found that the most common harmonic order in Chinese freight trains is 18–19. Although a polygonal wheel could generate less impact on the track than a\nwheel flat, this defect can cause serious damage to the track due to resonance effects in the\nTo identify the occurrence of these OOR anomalies in train wheels, innovative\nmethodologies have been developed combining signal processing and automatic learning techniques. These methodologies are based on the extraction of damage sensitivity features, making possible the distinction between undamaged and damaged situations. Recently, many studies have shown good results in detecting OOR damages using\ndistinct approaches [24–29]. Mishra et al. concluded that a single FBG (Fiber Bragg Grating) sensor, positioned along the rail can detect the presence of wheel flats.\nLourenço et al. created an automatic algorithm for diagnosing OOR defects. The\nproposed methodology consists of isolating specific defective wheels and then identifying the severity of the damage, using only acceleration and strain data measured on\nthe track. In another study, Krummenacher et al. , proposed two machine-learningBy extracting the features, it is possible to transform the measured data into an alternative form of information where the correlation with damage is more easily observed. There are various techniques for feature extraction, the most common being CWT\n(continuous wavelet transform) [31–33], PCA (principal component analysis) ,detection of polygonal wheels on freight vehicles using CWT and ARX features, using\n6 accelerometers, 3 on each side of the railway track. Mosleh et al. introduced aflats by extracting AR features from acceleration records. Moreover, Mohammadi et al.\nadopted linear features, particularly, CWT, PCA, ARX and AR, and their research findingsin the context of wheel flat damage detection. Although these studies have demonstrated robust results in detection, they show some limitations in dealing with the non-linear effects associated with operational effects, such as the train speed. Due to the inability of these linear techniques to attenuate operation effects, the inclusion of different speeds\nFor most of these studies, a feature normalisation stage is used when it is necessary to remove the operational effects. Usually, latent variable methods are used, such as PCA or multiple linear regression (MLR) . Thus, to deal with the non-linear phenomena and reduce the large amounts of data without relying on the aforementioned methods,\nthe first artificial neural networks were created to inherently execute this task . Over the years, new and more advanced networks have been developed, with the Autoencoder\n(AE) being one of the main types. Later, Olshausen et al. proposed the creation of\nsparse coding and Ng et al. introduced a sparse penalisation term in the hidden layer,\nto acquire more compact and effective features from lower-dimensional data. For some datasets with complex relationships between characteristics, employing more than one SAE\nis necessary, which is why stacked sparse autoencoders (SSAE) are commonly used .\nNowadays, these types of AE are widely used in various scientific fields, but specifically\nfor structural engineering only a few studies are found, and most are about damage detection on bridges [45–47]. Amaral et al. , proposed an approach for detecting structural anomalies based on SAE and Shewhart’s T control chart. The characteristics extracted byin structures. In another similar study, Amaral et al. , applied the same approach to\na numerical model of a highway viaduct in Brazil reaching more than 99% of successful classifications of structural damage with the combination of SAE and Support Vector Machine. Pathirage et al. proposed a framework utilizing SAE’s potential for dimensionality reduction, which facilitated the assessment of damage detection performance on Many of these AE algorithms already performed feature classification in order to discriminate the different types of damages and severities. However, the AE methods can also be combined with other techniques commonly used to classify the data. They can be used unsupervised methods, in which the model is trained without any labels provided to the\ntraining dataset, such as k-means , self-organising maps (SOM) , isolation forest, gaussian mixture model , k-medoids and cluster analysis , or supervised\nmethods, which assume that the hierarchy of database categories is known, such as NaiveBayes classifiers , k-Nearest Neighbours classifiers , Support Vector Machinetwo types of OOR damages, flats and polygonal wheels, based on acceleration responses obtained from a virtual wayside monitoring system.

The application of sensors on both sides of theTo obtain the responses from the railway track, it is necessary to apply sensors on the track that can measure the dynamic responses of the crossing trains. As it is not always possible\nto install them due to the high costs involved, simulations have been carried out based on calibrated models of the track , vehicle and considering their dynamic interaction,\nas well as including the track irregularities. Simulations include cases with healthy wheelsTo simulate the dynamic interactions between the vehicle and the track, an in-house software VSI – Vehicle-Structure Interaction Analysis is used, which was initially developed by\nNeves et al. and later improved by Montenegro et al. .

Using Lagrange multipliers, this tool connects\nwheel displacements with the track nodal displacements, incorporating track irregularities and OOR profiles through a set of constraint equations. These equations are solved\nalongside equilibrium equations, forming a unified system that couples the two subsystems\n. Including the track irregularities directly in the constraint equations are beneficial since it avoids explicitly considering\nthem in the FEM model. Moreover, it also allows to include the wheel and OOR profiles as a periodic rail irregularity, simplifying the analysis. Thus, before starting the analysis, the\nVSI software imports track irregularities and OOR profiles from a MATLAB file, whichto the vertical and lateral irregularities in each rail in each respective position, and adds it to the constraint equations of the system throughout the dynamics analysis. Then, the\nsystem of dynamic equations is solved using the typical Newmark integration method.\nThe impact of track irregularity on wheel defect classification is significant, as a lower track quality tends to result in a higher likelihood of misclassification. A comprehensive\nexploration of this influence was previously undertaken by Mosleh et al. as documented in their research study . Hence, this study does not delve into the impact of track\nquality; rather, it primarily centres on the utilisation of AI-based methodologies for the detection and classification of wheel defects. For this, four different profiles are used, based\non European Standard EN 13848–2 . In this case, power spectral density (PSD) curvesFor OOR defects, several profiles are defined based on real measurements in representative profiles of the various severities. Subsequently, the structural matrices are imported\nMore details on track and train properties, including additional information on traintrack interaction, can be found in previous publications . Figure 1 shows the\nvehicle–track interaction model schematisation and some details about the train and track\nsubsystems, as well as the track irregularities and wheel-rail contact model.According to the conclusions reached in other studies with this type of damage ,\nthe most promising location of the sensors is on the rail. To reduce installation and maintenance costs, it is important to reduce the number of sensors without compromising the\nquality of the results. Therefore, based on a sensitivity analysis performed during the study,\nonly two vertical unidirectional accelerometers were used on each rail, 4 in total (A1 to A4),\nsince they provided a higher cost–benefit ratio. These sensors are mounted on the rail atdefects, different simulation scenarios with perfect wheels (baseline) and OOR wheels\n(damage) were defined for a five-wagon Laagrss freight train. Based on different crossing speeds, loading schemes and rail irregularities profiles, 120 baseline and 180 damage scenarios (90 for polygonal wheels and 90 for wheel flats) were defined, as summarised in For baseline scenarios, six loading schemes with five different speeds (40, 60, 80, 100\nand 120 km/h) and four rail irregularity profiles were considered, giving a total of 120 scenarios. The loading schemes used are: empty, half-loaded, full-loaded and, additionally,For the damage cases, a total of 90 scenarios were generated for polygonal wheels. These\nscenarios including 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (H1, H2 and H3) x 10 different irregularity profiles within each specified harmonic interval. In these 10 irregularity\nprofiles, based on the defect amplitude, two amplitudes are considered, five simulations for\nA1 and five simulations for A2. Similarly, 90 scenarios were created for wheel flats, involving 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (F1, F2 and F3) x 10 different irregularitywheel radius . This wave phenomenon can be characterised by the different wavelengths formed (harmonics θ ), and by the levels of irregularity ( Lw ) associated with each of the harmonics. According to Peng , it is considered a polygonal wheel when the wear amplitude assumes values above 0. mm and wavelengths between 140 mm and the wheelTo define scenarios with polygonal wheels for the Laagrss wagon, a literature survey on\nexperimental measurements in defective wheels was conducted . Three experimental irregularity profiles were collected, illustrated in Figure 3. The first group (H6-8)\ncorresponds to a study carried out by Cai et al. with dominant harmonics from 6 to 8;**Figure 3.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) of polygonal wheels with**Figure 4.** Examples of polygonal damage profiles for each of the dominant harmonic intervals.the second group (H12-14) to a study authored by Tao et al. with dominant harmonics from 12 to 14; and the third profile (H17-18) to a study performed by Wu et al. with\nBased on the wheel irregularity spectra ( Lw ) taken from the respective measurement profiles, shown in Figure 3, and considering the contribution of the first 30 harmonics, several irregularity profiles were generated, according to Figure 4.

The irregularity profiles are generated randomly, but in this case, in function of two geometric\nvariables, the length and the depth of the flat. More details about the process of generation of flat profiles can be found in the study performed by Mosleh et al .

The sampling frequency for data acquisition is considered 10 kHz in order to ensure a good problem Figure 6a) shows two baseline cases for two speeds (40 and 100 km/h), where it is possible to observe the influence of speed on the dynamic response. The amplifying effect\nof speed can influence the identification of damage, which is why a robust baseline with a wide range of scenarios is very important. At a speed of 40 km/h, lower accelerations\naround 0. m/s⊃2 are observed. In contrast, at a speed of 100 km/h (considerably higher),\naccelerations increase substantially to around 3. m/s⊃2. This illustrates the significant**Figure 6.** Acceleration time-series in sensor A1 for Laagrss vehicle: (a) influence of speed, (b) influencehigher speeds.

After obtaining the acceleration measurements from the numerical simulations, an FFT algorithm is applied to the time series allowing the conversion of the signal from the time domain to the frequency domain. Then,predefined hyperparameters of the algorithm. The set hyperparameters are encoding and\ndecoding transfer functions, hidden layer size, maximum number of epochs, L2 weight regularisation term, sparsity regularisation term and a sparsity proportion term. Afterwards,**Figure 7.** Flowchart with the main phases of the methodology for detection and classification of OORthe features are extracted in the more compressed layer of the SAE, the so-called bottleneck layer. The number of features obtained is equal to the number of hidden layers which\nis usually considerably lower than the data size, allowing a compression of the input data.\nFurthermore, to enhance the sensitivity to damage, two levels of data fusion are applied to the bottleneck features using the Mahalanobis distance. In the first level, all features are\nfused into a damage index (DI) for each sensor and, in the second level, all the sensors\nare merged resulting in only one DI for each simulation. Finally, automatic damage detection is achieved by performing an outlier analysis, in which a statistical confidence limit\n(CB) is used, based on the Inverse Cumulative Gaussian Distribution Function (ICDF).\nFor feature classification, an automatic clustering process based on the k-means technique is implemented. This algorithm allows for the unsupervised and automatic classification of data, based on the calculation of statistical distances between objects. In k-means technique given a vector of data and chosen k clusters, the key is to find k centroids that minimise\nthe distance of each vector to its nearest centroid . Since it is necessary to define the number of clusters in advance, a global Silhouette index (SIL) was adopted to make\nan automatic process. At the end, the clusters will allow the classification of the two typesbetween the number of correct classifications and the total number of cases.damage detection problems, as it allows a signal to be converted from the time domain to the frequency domain, to capture the excitation frequencies induced by the wheel defects.\nIn addition, a data reduction is carried out at this stage, since the initial records contain aa crossing speed of 80 km/h. When comparing the FFT spectra for a train passage with flats, Figure 8a), with polygonal wheels, Figure 8b), there are visible differences in terms\nof amplitude peak values and excited frequency ranges. For flats, the amplitude peak values are higher and they induce frequencies in the range between DC and 1500accordance with some authors reports . In terms of severities, for flats, the more severe group (55–100 mm) is the one with the higher frequency content, as expected,a baseline response. For polygonal wheels, from the analysis of Figure 8b), it can be seen the frequency peaks for the H12–14 and H17–18 profiles around 100 and 150\nrespectively, while for the profile H6-8 a more flat spectrum is obtained without showing any significant peak. This can be explained by the irregularity level profile of thisThese two graphs can show which frequencies have higher content in the original signal.Autoencoders are artificial neural networks trained using an unsupervised approach,\nwhich aim first to learn coded representations of the data, compressing the input into\na latent space representation, and second, through this compressed information, reconstructing the information.

As training progresses, the data is compressed, and the main characteristics of the signals are obtained and retained in ‘Bottleneck 1’. Subsequently, these characteristics are\nused as input for training the second sparse autoencoder, which, after further compression,\nenables the extraction of the final features. Depending on the type of data under analysis,\nthe compression level differs, so multiple tests should be conducted to optimise these layer sizes. This optimisation was achieved by trial and test, changing both the size of the first\nIt should be noted that this network architecture, where the dimensions of the layers gradually decrease along the network until reaching the bottleneck layer , has proven\nto be highly robust for the type of data used. It allows for effective compression of results**Figure 9.** Schematic of the structure of the SSAE neural network used in this study.After extracting the features from the bottleneck layer of the SSAE, the difference between the healthy wheels scenarios and the damage wheels scenarios is still not sufficient. Hence\na data fusion is performed. With this fusion, it is possible to increase the sensitivity of the\nfeatures, and as a result, to obtain a damage index (DI) for each simulation. Thus, the Mahalanobis distance (MD) is used to reduce the volume of extracted data and preserve the most relevant information . Briefly, MD is a metric that measures the distance between two points in a feature space consisting of two or more variables, being independent of the\nscale of the features, thus allowing an increase in the sensitivity of the features to cases with damage. The MD, denoted here as DI, is calculated for each simulation using the followingin which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−], and ¯ x is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The MD is calculated for each sensor and for each simulation, obtaining a matrix of n distances per k number of sensors.Finally, the discrimination of the features consists in distinguishing the features as corresponding to a healthy or damaged case. At this stage of the methodology, an analysis of\nabnormal values is carried out, which will allow the condition of the train wheels to beautomatically monitored and these values to be classified into different classes. This phaseThe outlier analysis consists of grouping, by probabilistic distribution processes, the datato the previously created group. For this, a statistical confidence limit (CB) is used, based on the inverse cumulative Gaussian distribution function (ICDF), considering the mean\nvalue, ¯ μ, and standard deviation, σ, of the baseline feature vector.Whenever a value of a DI indicator is equal to or greater than CB, it is considered an outlier (the null hypothesis is rejected), thus representing a case of damage.For feature classification, a clustering process is used to divide the dataset into distinct clusters that should be as compact and separated as possible . For clustering, the k-meanson the distances of their vectors. Recent studies showed that the k-means algorithm has shown promising results . The main limitation of this technique is that it requires\nknowledge of the number of clusters in advance. For this purpose, the global silhouetteThis section presents the main results obtained through the application of the methodology proposed in section 3 to the calculated track responses. The methodology is applied using damaged wheel passages for the three simulated train speeds (60, 80 and 100 km/h),hyperparameters (presented in section 3). By adjusting these hyperparameters, it is possible to make the algorithm more efficient and improve the generalisation capabilities, as only\nthe most important features are retained. The optimisation of these hyperparameters isof data under analysis. Based on the principles of the SAE already outlined in other works\nIn the context of this study, the non-linear transfer functions (logsig) proved to be more effective than the linear ones, being the ones used in all the studied cases. After analysing Table 3, there is a similarity in the hyperparameters when comparing the two types of OOR damage. It is observed that the data compression level is the same for both cases, around\n93%, as 500 features are extracted in Bottleneck 2 from the initial input data with 7000\nConcerning the type of damage situation, the size of the ‘Bottleneck 1’ and ‘Bottleneck\n2’ was increased to bring them even closer to the initial amount of input data. This can beanalysis, making it challenging for the autoencoder to define relationships between the data, hence requiring a larger number. On the contrary, the maximum number of epochsIt is also important to emphasise that of the various hyperparameters presented, theOnce the hyperparameters have been defined, all the steps of the methodology are applied to the new dataset. For simplicity, in this section, only the last phase of the methodology will be presented, namely an outlier analysis for damage detection and cluster analysis for damage classification. For each sensor, a matrix n × m is created, where n\nis the number of test passages (baseline scenarios + damage scenarios), and m represents the number of extracted features. So, the size of the matrices is 210 × 2000 in case of the\ntype of damage, 75 × 500 for each amplitude in polygonal wheel, and 120 × 500 for wheelDespite the visual distinction between healthy and damaged wheels based on the data processing presented in subsection 3.2, unsupervised learning must use strategies capable of automatically detecting damage. To this end, an outlier analysis is employed, which consists of defining a confidence threshold using a significance level of 1% , represented**Figure 10.** Automatic OOR damage detection based on outlier analysis.by the green line in Figure 10. This approach makes it possible to successfully detect allTo distinguish the two types of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed. Figure 11\nshows a clear distinction between the damage, even when using a dataset with three different train speeds (60,80 and 100 km/h).. In the case of Figure 11a), using all four\naccelerometers, it is possible to efficiently separate the set into two large clusters, despite\n30 misclassifications (16 in the polygonisation and 14 in the flats). Even so, the accuracy\npercentage is around 85%, which is a very good result. To analyse the sensitivity to the number of sensors, only two sensors were used, one on each side ). The results\nimproved, with a decrease in the number of misclassifications from 30 to 21 (13 for polygonisation and 8 for flats). One explanation could be the disparity in sensor sensitivity to the damage, where some sensors are more sensitive than others due to their spatial positioning in relation to the damage. By merging the data from the less sensitive sensors with the\nmore sensitive ones, this could have a negative impact on the results. Thus, the percentage\nThe purpose behind presenting these two plots was to demonstrate that, whether using 4 sensors or 2 sensors, the classification remains remarkably robust, showing lowAfter identifying the type of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed once again to\nclassify the severity of each damage separately. Regarding polygonal wheels, the classification involves both amplitude and harmonic orders, leading to the clusters depicted in the obtained clusters reasonably reflect the two amplitude groups, with all misclassifications associated with the H6-8 harmonic cases (17 misclassifications). Once the amplitude\nis identified, harmonic classification must be carried out separately for each of the amplitudes. In Figure 12b), related to amplitude A1, it is observed that the obtained clusters**Figure 11.** Automatic OOR damage classification based on cluster analysis using: a) 4 sensors; b) 2are nearly perfect, with only 3 misclassifications. In Figure 12c), there are only 3 misclassifications, totalling 8 misclassifications in the classification of the number of dominant\nThe classification of harmonic order is only possible with the separation of amplitudes,\nFigure 13 presents the clusters obtained for the wheel flat cases. The separation between\nthe less severe group and baseline cases and intermediate (cluster 3) and severe cases (cluster 4) is reduced, resulting in a total of 19 misclassifications. Nevertheless, this result showsrate of about 84%. One possible reason for this significant number of misclassifications could be directly associated with the number of impacts captured by the sensor.In order to contribute to the safety of railway transportation and service quality, an automatic methodology based on machine learning has been proposed. This methodology can accurately detect and classify two types of OOR wheel damage in railway vehicles allowing to mitigate problems at both track and vehicle level, such as derailments or material\ndegradation. It includes a new technique for feature extraction based on a dedicated neural network, the Sparse Autoencoder. This non-linear technique is an upgrade concerning the commonly used linear techniques for feature extraction since it allows a better normalisation of the operational effects in the analysed data, as well as the reduction of large amounts\nof data without relying on other techniques, while keeping the most valuable information. These improvements are achieved through the use of different hyperparameters in**Figure 12.** Automatic classification of polygonal wheels based on cluster analysis: a) amplitude A1-A2;**Figure 13.** Automatic classification of wheel flats based on cluster analysis.the calculations, such as non-linear activation functions and sparsity terms. Consequently,circulation. Particularly in the railway engineering field, the inclusion of this technique\nshowed a good potential to deal with variable train speeds, essentially due to the amplifying effect on the measured track dynamic responses which could induce errors in damage The application of the methodology to the data set proved to be very successful in detecting and classifying the two types of OOR damages. Damage detection was perfect, without\nany false detection. In terms of classifying the type of damage, the results are very good,\nwith a success rate of around 85%, but if only two accelerometers are considered the successrate increases to around 90%. These results are encouraging since the range of speeds considered in the analysis, between 60 and 100 km/h, is the most representative of in-service\nfreight trains. Also, the results show that including the Sparse Autoencoder has a positive\neffect in the normalization of the train speed in the damage data set.\nRegarding the severity classification for each type of damage, the methodology proved equally successful in clustering the different damage severities. For polygonal wheels, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the severity groups in terms of defect amplitude, failing only for the H6-8 harmonic cases, and in terms of harmonic orders for each amplitude,\nwith almost perfect results. For wheel flats, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the three severity groups, though with some misclassifications between the less severe group\nand baseline cases and between intermediate and severe cases. A success rate of around 86%\nis achieved in the classification of polygonal wheel severities and 84% in the classification of wheel flat severities. Even so, these high success rates of over 80% show the robustness\nof this methodology in damage classification regardless of the train speed.on on-site measurements. Additionally, this methodology could be carried out for other types of railway vehicles, for example, passenger vehicles, since the dynamic responses are\ndifferent from freight vehicles. In that case, exploring other recent types of autoencoders,\nTo increase the complexity of the problem, the objective is to explore the concept of\nmultiple damages (same or different OOR types). For this, it will be necessary to incorporate a new stage in the methodology, the damage location stage, which will make it possible\nto distinguish isolated damage from multiple damage, as well as their respective location.\nThus, damage will be identified using cut signals, which will then be used to classify theThis work is a result of project WAY4SafeRail-WAYside monitoring system FOR SAFE RAIL transportation, with reference NORTE-01-0247-FEDER-069595, co-funded by the European Regional\nDevelopment Fund (ERDF), through the North Portugal Regional Operational Programme\nPartnership Agreement.

Within this context,\nan unsupervised methodology based on artificial intelligence techniques is presented, which allows the detection and classification of wheels, based on dynamic responses induced on the track by crossing freight railway vehicles. The methodology involves the following\nsteps: (i) data collection and pre-processing, (ii) feature extraction (iii)\ndata fusion and (iv) feature discrimination.

However, this type of system entail high costs envisaging the vehicle wheel condition monitoring, since sensors need to be installed in every vehicle in order to achieve a good representativity . On the other hand, wayside systems are a more viable solution for identifying wheel defects, since the condition of allThe most common wheel defects are known as OOR. As the name infers, this defect is related to deformations on the surface of the wheel circumference that make it not round.\nThis deformation can have many forms and different causes, leading to faults on the vehicle and on the track due to the higher dynamic force values [4–6]. The OOR damagesa function of their shape and size, vehicle characteristics and speed [7–10]. Wheel flats induce high dynamic impact loads on the railway infrastructure, which causes significant damage to both tracks and vehicles, such as broken axles, damaged rolling bearings and cracks in the wheels, rails and sleepers . Moreover, it also generates high vibrations\ntransmitted to the rolling stock, inducing significant stresses and causing damage to the In the case of polygonal wheels, the formation mechanism can be roughly classified\ninto three categories, namely, (1) initial wheel defects , (2) a natural vibration of the\nvehicle–track system and (3) thermoelastic instability . The formation mechanism is strongly contingent on the vehicle type and its operational characteristics, withof dominant harmonic orders [19–22]. For example, Tao et al. studied asymmetrical polygonal wear on metro wheels and obtained harmonic orders of 12–14, while another study by Tao et al. found that the most common harmonic order in Chinese freight trains is 18–19. Although a polygonal wheel could generate less impact on the track than a\nwheel flat, this defect can cause serious damage to the track due to resonance effects in the\nTo identify the occurrence of these OOR anomalies in train wheels, innovative\nmethodologies have been developed combining signal processing and automatic learning techniques. These methodologies are based on the extraction of damage sensitivity features, making possible the distinction between undamaged and damaged situations. Recently, many studies have shown good results in detecting OOR damages using\ndistinct approaches [24–29]. Mishra et al. concluded that a single FBG (Fiber Bragg Grating) sensor, positioned along the rail can detect the presence of wheel flats.\nLourenço et al. created an automatic algorithm for diagnosing OOR defects. The\nproposed methodology consists of isolating specific defective wheels and then identifying the severity of the damage, using only acceleration and strain data measured on\nthe track. In another study, Krummenacher et al. , proposed two machine-learningBy extracting the features, it is possible to transform the measured data into an alternative form of information where the correlation with damage is more easily observed. There are various techniques for feature extraction, the most common being CWT\n(continuous wavelet transform) [31–33], PCA (principal component analysis) ,detection of polygonal wheels on freight vehicles using CWT and ARX features, using\n6 accelerometers, 3 on each side of the railway track. Mosleh et al. introduced aflats by extracting AR features from acceleration records. Moreover, Mohammadi et al.\nadopted linear features, particularly, CWT, PCA, ARX and AR, and their research findingsin the context of wheel flat damage detection. Although these studies have demonstrated robust results in detection, they show some limitations in dealing with the non-linear effects associated with operational effects, such as the train speed. Due to the inability of these linear techniques to attenuate operation effects, the inclusion of different speeds\nFor most of these studies, a feature normalisation stage is used when it is necessary to remove the operational effects. Usually, latent variable methods are used, such as PCA or multiple linear regression (MLR) . Thus, to deal with the non-linear phenomena and reduce the large amounts of data without relying on the aforementioned methods,\nthe first artificial neural networks were created to inherently execute this task . Over the years, new and more advanced networks have been developed, with the Autoencoder\n(AE) being one of the main types. Later, Olshausen et al. proposed the creation of\nsparse coding and Ng et al. introduced a sparse penalisation term in the hidden layer,\nto acquire more compact and effective features from lower-dimensional data. For some datasets with complex relationships between characteristics, employing more than one SAE\nis necessary, which is why stacked sparse autoencoders (SSAE) are commonly used .\nNowadays, these types of AE are widely used in various scientific fields, but specifically\nfor structural engineering only a few studies are found, and most are about damage detection on bridges [45–47].

Pathirage et al. proposed a framework utilizing SAE’s potential for dimensionality reduction, which facilitated the assessment of damage detection performance on Many of these AE algorithms already performed feature classification in order to discriminate the different types of damages and severities. However, the AE methods can also be combined with other techniques commonly used to classify the data. They can be used unsupervised methods, in which the model is trained without any labels provided to the\ntraining dataset, such as k-means , self-organising maps (SOM) , isolation forest, gaussian mixture model , k-medoids and cluster analysis , or supervised\nmethods, which assume that the hierarchy of database categories is known, such as NaiveBayes classifiers , k-Nearest Neighbours classifiers , Support Vector Machinetwo types of OOR damages, flats and polygonal wheels, based on acceleration responses obtained from a virtual wayside monitoring system.

The application of sensors on both sides of theTo obtain the responses from the railway track, it is necessary to apply sensors on the track that can measure the dynamic responses of the crossing trains. As it is not always possible\nto install them due to the high costs involved, simulations have been carried out based on calibrated models of the track , vehicle and considering their dynamic interaction,\nas well as including the track irregularities.

Including the track irregularities directly in the constraint equations are beneficial since it avoids explicitly considering\nthem in the FEM model. Moreover, it also allows to include the wheel and OOR profiles as a periodic rail irregularity, simplifying the analysis. Thus, before starting the analysis, the\nVSI software imports track irregularities and OOR profiles from a MATLAB file, whichto the vertical and lateral irregularities in each rail in each respective position, and adds it to the constraint equations of the system throughout the dynamics analysis. Then, the\nsystem of dynamic equations is solved using the typical Newmark integration method.\nThe impact of track irregularity on wheel defect classification is significant, as a lower track quality tends to result in a higher likelihood of misclassification. A comprehensive\nexploration of this influence was previously undertaken by Mosleh et al. as documented in their research study . Hence, this study does not delve into the impact of track\nquality; rather, it primarily centres on the utilisation of AI-based methodologies for the detection and classification of wheel defects. For this, four different profiles are used, based\non European Standard EN 13848–2 .

To reduce installation and maintenance costs, it is important to reduce the number of sensors without compromising the\nquality of the results.

Based on different crossing speeds, loading schemes and rail irregularities profiles, 120 baseline and 180 damage scenarios (90 for polygonal wheels and 90 for wheel flats) were defined, as summarised in For baseline scenarios, six loading schemes with five different speeds (40, 60, 80, 100\nand 120 km/h) and four rail irregularity profiles were considered, giving a total of 120 scenarios. The loading schemes used are: empty, half-loaded, full-loaded and, additionally,For the damage cases, a total of 90 scenarios were generated for polygonal wheels.

In these 10 irregularity\nprofiles, based on the defect amplitude, two amplitudes are considered, five simulations for\nA1 and five simulations for A2. Similarly, 90 scenarios were created for wheel flats, involving 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (F1, F2 and F3) x 10 different irregularitywheel radius . This wave phenomenon can be characterised by the different wavelengths formed (harmonics θ ), and by the levels of irregularity ( Lw ) associated with each of the harmonics. According to Peng , it is considered a polygonal wheel when the wear amplitude assumes values above 0. mm and wavelengths between 140 mm and the wheelTo define scenarios with polygonal wheels for the Laagrss wagon, a literature survey on\nexperimental measurements in defective wheels was conducted . Three experimental irregularity profiles were collected, illustrated in Figure 3. The first group (H6-8)\ncorresponds to a study carried out by Cai et al. with dominant harmonics from 6 to 8;**Figure 3.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) of polygonal wheels with**Figure 4.** Examples of polygonal damage profiles for each of the dominant harmonic intervals.the second group (H12-14) to a study authored by Tao et al. with dominant harmonics from 12 to 14; and the third profile (H17-18) to a study performed by Wu et al. with\nBased on the wheel irregularity spectra ( Lw ) taken from the respective measurement profiles, shown in Figure 3, and considering the contribution of the first 30 harmonics, several irregularity profiles were generated, according to Figure 4.

After obtaining the acceleration measurements from the numerical simulations, an FFT algorithm is applied to the time series allowing the conversion of the signal from the time domain to the frequency domain. Then,predefined hyperparameters of the algorithm. The set hyperparameters are encoding and\ndecoding transfer functions, hidden layer size, maximum number of epochs, L2 weight regularisation term, sparsity regularisation term and a sparsity proportion term. Afterwards,**Figure 7.** Flowchart with the main phases of the methodology for detection and classification of OORthe features are extracted in the more compressed layer of the SAE, the so-called bottleneck layer. The number of features obtained is equal to the number of hidden layers which\nis usually considerably lower than the data size, allowing a compression of the input data.\nFurthermore, to enhance the sensitivity to damage, two levels of data fusion are applied to the bottleneck features using the Mahalanobis distance. In the first level, all features are\nfused into a damage index (DI) for each sensor and, in the second level, all the sensors\nare merged resulting in only one DI for each simulation. Finally, automatic damage detection is achieved by performing an outlier analysis, in which a statistical confidence limit\n(CB) is used, based on the Inverse Cumulative Gaussian Distribution Function (ICDF).\nFor feature classification, an automatic clustering process based on the k-means technique is implemented. This algorithm allows for the unsupervised and automatic classification of data, based on the calculation of statistical distances between objects. In k-means technique given a vector of data and chosen k clusters, the key is to find k centroids that minimise\nthe distance of each vector to its nearest centroid . Since it is necessary to define the number of clusters in advance, a global Silhouette index (SIL) was adopted to make\nan automatic process. At the end, the clusters will allow the classification of the two typesbetween the number of correct classifications and the total number of cases.damage detection problems, as it allows a signal to be converted from the time domain to the frequency domain, to capture the excitation frequencies induced by the wheel defects.\nIn addition, a data reduction is carried out at this stage, since the initial records contain aa crossing speed of 80 km/h. When comparing the FFT spectra for a train passage with flats, Figure 8a), with polygonal wheels, Figure 8b), there are visible differences in terms\nof amplitude peak values and excited frequency ranges. For flats, the amplitude peak values are higher and they induce frequencies in the range between DC and 1500accordance with some authors reports . In terms of severities, for flats, the more severe group (55–100 mm) is the one with the higher frequency content, as expected,a baseline response. For polygonal wheels, from the analysis of Figure 8b), it can be seen the frequency peaks for the H12–14 and H17–18 profiles around 100 and 150\nrespectively, while for the profile H6-8 a more flat spectrum is obtained without showing any significant peak. This can be explained by the irregularity level profile of thisThese two graphs can show which frequencies have higher content in the original signal.Autoencoders are artificial neural networks trained using an unsupervised approach,\nwhich aim first to learn coded representations of the data, compressing the input into\na latent space representation, and second, through this compressed information, reconstructing the information. The basic architecture of this type of network consists of threewhere **Wij**, **Wjk** are the weights connection matrices between input layer-hidden\nlayer and hidden layer-output layer, **X** = ( **X** 1, **X** 2, . . ., **Xn** ) is the input data vector,\n**H** = ( **H** 1, . . ., **Hm** ) is the low-dimensional vector and **X** [ˆ] = ( **X** [ˆ] 1, **X** [ˆ] 2, . . ., **X** [ˆ] **n** ) is the output**Figure 8.** Frequency domain responses on position 1 for the crossing speed of 80 km/h: (a) wheel flats,data vector. **b** 1, **b** 2 are bias vectors and σ 1, σ 2 are the activation function used in each of thereconstruction of the input X [ˆ], as shown in Equation (3).

After incorporating various inputs into the SSAE training, they are integrated into the so-called\n‘Input 1’. As training progresses, the data is compressed, and the main characteristics of the signals are obtained and retained in ‘Bottleneck 1’. Subsequently, these characteristics are\nused as input for training the second sparse autoencoder, which, after further compression,\nenables the extraction of the final features. Depending on the type of data under analysis,\nthe compression level differs, so multiple tests should be conducted to optimise these layer sizes. This optimisation was achieved by trial and test, changing both the size of the first\nIt should be noted that this network architecture, where the dimensions of the layers gradually decrease along the network until reaching the bottleneck layer , has proven\nto be highly robust for the type of data used. It allows for effective compression of results**Figure 9.** Schematic of the structure of the SSAE neural network used in this study.After extracting the features from the bottleneck layer of the SSAE, the difference between the healthy wheels scenarios and the damage wheels scenarios is still not sufficient. Hence\na data fusion is performed. With this fusion, it is possible to increase the sensitivity of the\nfeatures, and as a result, to obtain a damage index (DI) for each simulation. Thus, the Mahalanobis distance (MD) is used to reduce the volume of extracted data and preserve the most relevant information . Briefly, MD is a metric that measures the distance between two points in a feature space consisting of two or more variables, being independent of the\nscale of the features, thus allowing an increase in the sensitivity of the features to cases with damage. The MD, denoted here as DI, is calculated for each simulation using the followingin which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−], and ¯ x is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The MD is calculated for each sensor and for each simulation, obtaining a matrix of n distances per k number of sensors.Finally, the discrimination of the features consists in distinguishing the features as corresponding to a healthy or damaged case. At this stage of the methodology, an analysis of\nabnormal values is carried out, which will allow the condition of the train wheels to beautomatically monitored and these values to be classified into different classes. This phaseThe outlier analysis consists of grouping, by probabilistic distribution processes, the datato the previously created group. For this, a statistical confidence limit (CB) is used, based on the inverse cumulative Gaussian distribution function (ICDF), considering the mean\nvalue, ¯ μ, and standard deviation, σ, of the baseline feature vector.Whenever a value of a DI indicator is equal to or greater than CB, it is considered an outlier (the null hypothesis is rejected), thus representing a case of damage.For feature classification, a clustering process is used to divide the dataset into distinct clusters that should be as compact and separated as possible . For clustering, the k-meanson the distances of their vectors. Recent studies showed that the k-means algorithm has shown promising results . The main limitation of this technique is that it requires\nknowledge of the number of clusters in advance. For this purpose, the global silhouetteThis section presents the main results obtained through the application of the methodology proposed in section 3 to the calculated track responses. The methodology is applied using damaged wheel passages for the three simulated train speeds (60, 80 and 100 km/h),hyperparameters (presented in section 3). By adjusting these hyperparameters, it is possible to make the algorithm more efficient and improve the generalisation capabilities, as only\nthe most important features are retained. The optimisation of these hyperparameters isof data under analysis. Based on the principles of the SAE already outlined in other works\nIn the context of this study, the non-linear transfer functions (logsig) proved to be more effective than the linear ones, being the ones used in all the studied cases. After analysing Table 3, there is a similarity in the hyperparameters when comparing the two types of OOR damage. It is observed that the data compression level is the same for both cases, around\n93%, as 500 features are extracted in Bottleneck 2 from the initial input data with 7000\nConcerning the type of damage situation, the size of the ‘Bottleneck 1’ and ‘Bottleneck\n2’ was increased to bring them even closer to the initial amount of input data. This can beanalysis, making it challenging for the autoencoder to define relationships between the data, hence requiring a larger number. On the contrary, the maximum number of epochsIt is also important to emphasise that of the various hyperparameters presented, theOnce the hyperparameters have been defined, all the steps of the methodology are applied to the new dataset. For simplicity, in this section, only the last phase of the methodology will be presented, namely an outlier analysis for damage detection and cluster analysis for damage classification. For each sensor, a matrix n × m is created, where n\nis the number of test passages (baseline scenarios + damage scenarios), and m represents the number of extracted features. So, the size of the matrices is 210 × 2000 in case of the\ntype of damage, 75 × 500 for each amplitude in polygonal wheel, and 120 × 500 for wheelDespite the visual distinction between healthy and damaged wheels based on the data processing presented in subsection 3.2, unsupervised learning must use strategies capable of automatically detecting damage. To this end, an outlier analysis is employed, which consists of defining a confidence threshold using a significance level of 1% , represented**Figure 10.** Automatic OOR damage detection based on outlier analysis.by the green line in Figure 10. This approach makes it possible to successfully detect allTo distinguish the two types of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed. Figure 11\nshows a clear distinction between the damage, even when using a dataset with three different train speeds (60,80 and 100 km/h).. In the case of Figure 11a), using all four\naccelerometers, it is possible to efficiently separate the set into two large clusters, despite\n30 misclassifications (16 in the polygonisation and 14 in the flats). Even so, the accuracy\npercentage is around 85%, which is a very good result. To analyse the sensitivity to the number of sensors, only two sensors were used, one on each side ). The results\nimproved, with a decrease in the number of misclassifications from 30 to 21 (13 for polygonisation and 8 for flats). One explanation could be the disparity in sensor sensitivity to the damage, where some sensors are more sensitive than others due to their spatial positioning in relation to the damage. By merging the data from the less sensitive sensors with the\nmore sensitive ones, this could have a negative impact on the results. Thus, the percentage\nThe purpose behind presenting these two plots was to demonstrate that, whether using 4 sensors or 2 sensors, the classification remains remarkably robust, showing lowAfter identifying the type of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed once again to\nclassify the severity of each damage separately. Regarding polygonal wheels, the classification involves both amplitude and harmonic orders, leading to the clusters depicted in the obtained clusters reasonably reflect the two amplitude groups, with all misclassifications associated with the H6-8 harmonic cases (17 misclassifications). Once the amplitude\nis identified, harmonic classification must be carried out separately for each of the amplitudes. In Figure 12b), related to amplitude A1, it is observed that the obtained clusters**Figure 11.** Automatic OOR damage classification based on cluster analysis using: a) 4 sensors; b) 2are nearly perfect, with only 3 misclassifications. In Figure 12c), there are only 3 misclassifications, totalling 8 misclassifications in the classification of the number of dominant\nThe classification of harmonic order is only possible with the separation of amplitudes,\nFigure 13 presents the clusters obtained for the wheel flat cases. The separation between\nthe less severe group and baseline cases and intermediate (cluster 3) and severe cases (cluster 4) is reduced, resulting in a total of 19 misclassifications. Nevertheless, this result showsrate of about 84%. One possible reason for this significant number of misclassifications could be directly associated with the number of impacts captured by the sensor.In order to contribute to the safety of railway transportation and service quality, an automatic methodology based on machine learning has been proposed. This methodology can accurately detect and classify two types of OOR wheel damage in railway vehicles allowing to mitigate problems at both track and vehicle level, such as derailments or material\ndegradation. It includes a new technique for feature extraction based on a dedicated neural network, the Sparse Autoencoder. This non-linear technique is an upgrade concerning the commonly used linear techniques for feature extraction since it allows a better normalisation of the operational effects in the analysed data, as well as the reduction of large amounts\nof data without relying on other techniques, while keeping the most valuable information. These improvements are achieved through the use of different hyperparameters in**Figure 12.** Automatic classification of polygonal wheels based on cluster analysis: a) amplitude A1-A2;**Figure 13.** Automatic classification of wheel flats based on cluster analysis.the calculations, such as non-linear activation functions and sparsity terms. Consequently,circulation. Particularly in the railway engineering field, the inclusion of this technique\nshowed a good potential to deal with variable train speeds, essentially due to the amplifying effect on the measured track dynamic responses which could induce errors in damage The application of the methodology to the data set proved to be very successful in detecting and classifying the two types of OOR damages. Damage detection was perfect, without\nany false detection. In terms of classifying the type of damage, the results are very good,\nwith a success rate of around 85%, but if only two accelerometers are considered the successrate increases to around 90%. These results are encouraging since the range of speeds considered in the analysis, between 60 and 100 km/h, is the most representative of in-service\nfreight trains. Also, the results show that including the Sparse Autoencoder has a positive\neffect in the normalization of the train speed in the damage data set.\nRegarding the severity classification for each type of damage, the methodology proved equally successful in clustering the different damage severities. For polygonal wheels, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the severity groups in terms of defect amplitude, failing only for the H6-8 harmonic cases, and in terms of harmonic orders for each amplitude,\nwith almost perfect results. For wheel flats, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the three severity groups, though with some misclassifications between the less severe group\nand baseline cases and between intermediate and severe cases. A success rate of around 86%\nis achieved in the classification of polygonal wheel severities and 84% in the classification of wheel flat severities. Even so, these high success rates of over 80% show the robustness\nof this methodology in damage classification regardless of the train speed.on on-site measurements. Additionally, this methodology could be carried out for other types of railway vehicles, for example, passenger vehicles, since the dynamic responses are\ndifferent from freight vehicles. In that case, exploring other recent types of autoencoders,\nTo increase the complexity of the problem, the objective is to explore the concept of\nmultiple damages (same or different OOR types). For this, it will be necessary to incorporate a new stage in the methodology, the damage location stage, which will make it possible\nto distinguish isolated damage from multiple damage, as well as their respective location.\nThus, damage will be identified using cut signals, which will then be used to classify theThis work is a result of project WAY4SafeRail-WAYside monitoring system FOR SAFE RAIL transportation, with reference NORTE-01-0247-FEDER-069595, co-funded by the European Regional\nDevelopment Fund (ERDF), through the North Portugal Regional Operational Programme\nPartnership Agreement.

However, this type of system entail high costs envisaging the vehicle wheel condition monitoring, since sensors need to be installed in every vehicle in order to achieve a good representativity . On the other hand, wayside systems are a more viable solution for identifying wheel defects, since the condition of allThe most common wheel defects are known as OOR. As the name infers, this defect is related to deformations on the surface of the wheel circumference that make it not round.\nThis deformation can have many forms and different causes, leading to faults on the vehicle and on the track due to the higher dynamic force values [4–6]. The OOR damagesa function of their shape and size, vehicle characteristics and speed [7–10]. Wheel flats induce high dynamic impact loads on the railway infrastructure, which causes significant damage to both tracks and vehicles, such as broken axles, damaged rolling bearings and cracks in the wheels, rails and sleepers . Moreover, it also generates high vibrations\ntransmitted to the rolling stock, inducing significant stresses and causing damage to the In the case of polygonal wheels, the formation mechanism can be roughly classified\ninto three categories, namely, (1) initial wheel defects , (2) a natural vibration of the\nvehicle–track system and (3) thermoelastic instability . The formation mechanism is strongly contingent on the vehicle type and its operational characteristics, withof dominant harmonic orders [19–22]. For example, Tao et al. studied asymmetrical polygonal wear on metro wheels and obtained harmonic orders of 12–14, while another study by Tao et al. found that the most common harmonic order in Chinese freight trains is 18–19. Although a polygonal wheel could generate less impact on the track than a\nwheel flat, this defect can cause serious damage to the track due to resonance effects in the\nTo identify the occurrence of these OOR anomalies in train wheels, innovative\nmethodologies have been developed combining signal processing and automatic learning techniques. These methodologies are based on the extraction of damage sensitivity features, making possible the distinction between undamaged and damaged situations. Recently, many studies have shown good results in detecting OOR damages using\ndistinct approaches [24–29]. Mishra et al. concluded that a single FBG (Fiber Bragg Grating) sensor, positioned along the rail can detect the presence of wheel flats.\nLourenço et al. created an automatic algorithm for diagnosing OOR defects. The\nproposed methodology consists of isolating specific defective wheels and then identifying the severity of the damage, using only acceleration and strain data measured on\nthe track. In another study, Krummenacher et al. , proposed two machine-learningBy extracting the features, it is possible to transform the measured data into an alternative form of information where the correlation with damage is more easily observed. There are various techniques for feature extraction, the most common being CWT\n(continuous wavelet transform) [31–33], PCA (principal component analysis) ,detection of polygonal wheels on freight vehicles using CWT and ARX features, using\n6 accelerometers, 3 on each side of the railway track. Mosleh et al. introduced aflats by extracting AR features from acceleration records. Moreover, Mohammadi et al.\nadopted linear features, particularly, CWT, PCA, ARX and AR, and their research findingsin the context of wheel flat damage detection. Although these studies have demonstrated robust results in detection, they show some limitations in dealing with the non-linear effects associated with operational effects, such as the train speed. Due to the inability of these linear techniques to attenuate operation effects, the inclusion of different speeds\nFor most of these studies, a feature normalisation stage is used when it is necessary to remove the operational effects. Usually, latent variable methods are used, such as PCA or multiple linear regression (MLR) . Thus, to deal with the non-linear phenomena and reduce the large amounts of data without relying on the aforementioned methods,\nthe first artificial neural networks were created to inherently execute this task . Over the years, new and more advanced networks have been developed, with the Autoencoder\n(AE) being one of the main types. Later, Olshausen et al. proposed the creation of\nsparse coding and Ng et al. introduced a sparse penalisation term in the hidden layer,\nto acquire more compact and effective features from lower-dimensional data. For some datasets with complex relationships between characteristics, employing more than one SAE\nis necessary, which is why stacked sparse autoencoders (SSAE) are commonly used .\nNowadays, these types of AE are widely used in various scientific fields, but specifically\nfor structural engineering only a few studies are found, and most are about damage detection on bridges [45–47].

However, the AE methods can also be combined with other techniques commonly used to classify the data. They can be used unsupervised methods, in which the model is trained without any labels provided to the\ntraining dataset, such as k-means , self-organising maps (SOM) , isolation forest, gaussian mixture model , k-medoids and cluster analysis , or supervised\nmethods, which assume that the hierarchy of database categories is known, such as NaiveBayes classifiers , k-Nearest Neighbours classifiers , Support Vector Machinetwo types of OOR damages, flats and polygonal wheels, based on acceleration responses obtained from a virtual wayside monitoring system.

The application of sensors on both sides of theTo obtain the responses from the railway track, it is necessary to apply sensors on the track that can measure the dynamic responses of the crossing trains. As it is not always possible\nto install them due to the high costs involved, simulations have been carried out based on calibrated models of the track , vehicle and considering their dynamic interaction,\nas well as including the track irregularities. Simulations include cases with healthy wheelsTo simulate the dynamic interactions between the vehicle and the track, an in-house software VSI – Vehicle-Structure Interaction Analysis is used, which was initially developed by\nNeves et al. and later improved by Montenegro et al. .

Including the track irregularities directly in the constraint equations are beneficial since it avoids explicitly considering\nthem in the FEM model. Moreover, it also allows to include the wheel and OOR profiles as a periodic rail irregularity, simplifying the analysis. Thus, before starting the analysis, the\nVSI software imports track irregularities and OOR profiles from a MATLAB file, whichto the vertical and lateral irregularities in each rail in each respective position, and adds it to the constraint equations of the system throughout the dynamics analysis. Then, the\nsystem of dynamic equations is solved using the typical Newmark integration method.\nThe impact of track irregularity on wheel defect classification is significant, as a lower track quality tends to result in a higher likelihood of misclassification. A comprehensive\nexploration of this influence was previously undertaken by Mosleh et al. as documented in their research study . Hence, this study does not delve into the impact of track\nquality; rather, it primarily centres on the utilisation of AI-based methodologies for the detection and classification of wheel defects. For this, four different profiles are used, based\non European Standard EN 13848–2 .

Subsequently, the structural matrices are imported\nMore details on track and train properties, including additional information on traintrack interaction, can be found in previous publications . Figure 1 shows the\nvehicle–track interaction model schematisation and some details about the train and track\nsubsystems, as well as the track irregularities and wheel-rail contact model.According to the conclusions reached in other studies with this type of damage ,\nthe most promising location of the sensors is on the rail. To reduce installation and maintenance costs, it is important to reduce the number of sensors without compromising the\nquality of the results. Therefore, based on a sensitivity analysis performed during the study,\nonly two vertical unidirectional accelerometers were used on each rail, 4 in total (A1 to A4),\nsince they provided a higher cost–benefit ratio. These sensors are mounted on the rail atdefects, different simulation scenarios with perfect wheels (baseline) and OOR wheels\n(damage) were defined for a five-wagon Laagrss freight train. Based on different crossing speeds, loading schemes and rail irregularities profiles, 120 baseline and 180 damage scenarios (90 for polygonal wheels and 90 for wheel flats) were defined, as summarised in For baseline scenarios, six loading schemes with five different speeds (40, 60, 80, 100\nand 120 km/h) and four rail irregularity profiles were considered, giving a total of 120 scenarios. The loading schemes used are: empty, half-loaded, full-loaded and, additionally,For the damage cases, a total of 90 scenarios were generated for polygonal wheels. These\nscenarios including 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (H1, H2 and H3) x 10 different irregularity profiles within each specified harmonic interval. In these 10 irregularity\nprofiles, based on the defect amplitude, two amplitudes are considered, five simulations for\nA1 and five simulations for A2. Similarly, 90 scenarios were created for wheel flats, involving 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (F1, F2 and F3) x 10 different irregularitywheel radius . This wave phenomenon can be characterised by the different wavelengths formed (harmonics θ ), and by the levels of irregularity ( Lw ) associated with each of the harmonics. According to Peng , it is considered a polygonal wheel when the wear amplitude assumes values above 0. mm and wavelengths between 140 mm and the wheelTo define scenarios with polygonal wheels for the Laagrss wagon, a literature survey on\nexperimental measurements in defective wheels was conducted . Three experimental irregularity profiles were collected, illustrated in Figure 3. The first group (H6-8)\ncorresponds to a study carried out by Cai et al. with dominant harmonics from 6 to 8;**Figure 3.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) of polygonal wheels with**Figure 4.** Examples of polygonal damage profiles for each of the dominant harmonic intervals.the second group (H12-14) to a study authored by Tao et al. with dominant harmonics from 12 to 14; and the third profile (H17-18) to a study performed by Wu et al. with\nBased on the wheel irregularity spectra ( Lw ) taken from the respective measurement profiles, shown in Figure 3, and considering the contribution of the first 30 harmonics, several irregularity profiles were generated, according to Figure 4.

The set hyperparameters are encoding and\ndecoding transfer functions, hidden layer size, maximum number of epochs, L2 weight regularisation term, sparsity regularisation term and a sparsity proportion term. Afterwards,**Figure 7.** Flowchart with the main phases of the methodology for detection and classification of OORthe features are extracted in the more compressed layer of the SAE, the so-called bottleneck layer. The number of features obtained is equal to the number of hidden layers which\nis usually considerably lower than the data size, allowing a compression of the input data.\nFurthermore, to enhance the sensitivity to damage, two levels of data fusion are applied to the bottleneck features using the Mahalanobis distance. In the first level, all features are\nfused into a damage index (DI) for each sensor and, in the second level, all the sensors\nare merged resulting in only one DI for each simulation. Finally, automatic damage detection is achieved by performing an outlier analysis, in which a statistical confidence limit\n(CB) is used, based on the Inverse Cumulative Gaussian Distribution Function (ICDF).\nFor feature classification, an automatic clustering process based on the k-means technique is implemented. This algorithm allows for the unsupervised and automatic classification of data, based on the calculation of statistical distances between objects. In k-means technique given a vector of data and chosen k clusters, the key is to find k centroids that minimise\nthe distance of each vector to its nearest centroid . Since it is necessary to define the number of clusters in advance, a global Silhouette index (SIL) was adopted to make\nan automatic process. At the end, the clusters will allow the classification of the two typesbetween the number of correct classifications and the total number of cases.damage detection problems, as it allows a signal to be converted from the time domain to the frequency domain, to capture the excitation frequencies induced by the wheel defects.\nIn addition, a data reduction is carried out at this stage, since the initial records contain aa crossing speed of 80 km/h. When comparing the FFT spectra for a train passage with flats, Figure 8a), with polygonal wheels, Figure 8b), there are visible differences in terms\nof amplitude peak values and excited frequency ranges. For flats, the amplitude peak values are higher and they induce frequencies in the range between DC and 1500accordance with some authors reports . In terms of severities, for flats, the more severe group (55–100 mm) is the one with the higher frequency content, as expected,a baseline response. For polygonal wheels, from the analysis of Figure 8b), it can be seen the frequency peaks for the H12–14 and H17–18 profiles around 100 and 150\nrespectively, while for the profile H6-8 a more flat spectrum is obtained without showing any significant peak. This can be explained by the irregularity level profile of thisThese two graphs can show which frequencies have higher content in the original signal.Autoencoders are artificial neural networks trained using an unsupervised approach,\nwhich aim first to learn coded representations of the data, compressing the input into\na latent space representation, and second, through this compressed information, reconstructing the information.

After incorporating various inputs into the SSAE training, they are integrated into the so-called\n‘Input 1’. As training progresses, the data is compressed, and the main characteristics of the signals are obtained and retained in ‘Bottleneck 1’. Subsequently, these characteristics are\nused as input for training the second sparse autoencoder, which, after further compression,\nenables the extraction of the final features. Depending on the type of data under analysis,\nthe compression level differs, so multiple tests should be conducted to optimise these layer sizes. This optimisation was achieved by trial and test, changing both the size of the first\nIt should be noted that this network architecture, where the dimensions of the layers gradually decrease along the network until reaching the bottleneck layer , has proven\nto be highly robust for the type of data used. It allows for effective compression of results**Figure 9.** Schematic of the structure of the SSAE neural network used in this study.After extracting the features from the bottleneck layer of the SSAE, the difference between the healthy wheels scenarios and the damage wheels scenarios is still not sufficient. Hence\na data fusion is performed. With this fusion, it is possible to increase the sensitivity of the\nfeatures, and as a result, to obtain a damage index (DI) for each simulation. Thus, the Mahalanobis distance (MD) is used to reduce the volume of extracted data and preserve the most relevant information . Briefly, MD is a metric that measures the distance between two points in a feature space consisting of two or more variables, being independent of the\nscale of the features, thus allowing an increase in the sensitivity of the features to cases with damage. The MD, denoted here as DI, is calculated for each simulation using the followingin which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−], and ¯ x is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The MD is calculated for each sensor and for each simulation, obtaining a matrix of n distances per k number of sensors.Finally, the discrimination of the features consists in distinguishing the features as corresponding to a healthy or damaged case. At this stage of the methodology, an analysis of\nabnormal values is carried out, which will allow the condition of the train wheels to beautomatically monitored and these values to be classified into different classes. This phaseThe outlier analysis consists of grouping, by probabilistic distribution processes, the datato the previously created group. For this, a statistical confidence limit (CB) is used, based on the inverse cumulative Gaussian distribution function (ICDF), considering the mean\nvalue, ¯ μ, and standard deviation, σ, of the baseline feature vector.Whenever a value of a DI indicator is equal to or greater than CB, it is considered an outlier (the null hypothesis is rejected), thus representing a case of damage.For feature classification, a clustering process is used to divide the dataset into distinct clusters that should be as compact and separated as possible . For clustering, the k-meanson the distances of their vectors. Recent studies showed that the k-means algorithm has shown promising results . The main limitation of this technique is that it requires\nknowledge of the number of clusters in advance. For this purpose, the global silhouetteThis section presents the main results obtained through the application of the methodology proposed in section 3 to the calculated track responses. The methodology is applied using damaged wheel passages for the three simulated train speeds (60, 80 and 100 km/h),hyperparameters (presented in section 3). By adjusting these hyperparameters, it is possible to make the algorithm more efficient and improve the generalisation capabilities, as only\nthe most important features are retained. The optimisation of these hyperparameters isof data under analysis. Based on the principles of the SAE already outlined in other works\nIn the context of this study, the non-linear transfer functions (logsig) proved to be more effective than the linear ones, being the ones used in all the studied cases. After analysing Table 3, there is a similarity in the hyperparameters when comparing the two types of OOR damage. It is observed that the data compression level is the same for both cases, around\n93%, as 500 features are extracted in Bottleneck 2 from the initial input data with 7000\nConcerning the type of damage situation, the size of the ‘Bottleneck 1’ and ‘Bottleneck\n2’ was increased to bring them even closer to the initial amount of input data. This can beanalysis, making it challenging for the autoencoder to define relationships between the data, hence requiring a larger number. On the contrary, the maximum number of epochsIt is also important to emphasise that of the various hyperparameters presented, theOnce the hyperparameters have been defined, all the steps of the methodology are applied to the new dataset. For simplicity, in this section, only the last phase of the methodology will be presented, namely an outlier analysis for damage detection and cluster analysis for damage classification. For each sensor, a matrix n × m is created, where n\nis the number of test passages (baseline scenarios + damage scenarios), and m represents the number of extracted features. So, the size of the matrices is 210 × 2000 in case of the\ntype of damage, 75 × 500 for each amplitude in polygonal wheel, and 120 × 500 for wheelDespite the visual distinction between healthy and damaged wheels based on the data processing presented in subsection 3.2, unsupervised learning must use strategies capable of automatically detecting damage. To this end, an outlier analysis is employed, which consists of defining a confidence threshold using a significance level of 1% , represented**Figure 10.** Automatic OOR damage detection based on outlier analysis.by the green line in Figure 10. This approach makes it possible to successfully detect allTo distinguish the two types of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed. Figure 11\nshows a clear distinction between the damage, even when using a dataset with three different train speeds (60,80 and 100 km/h).. In the case of Figure 11a), using all four\naccelerometers, it is possible to efficiently separate the set into two large clusters, despite\n30 misclassifications (16 in the polygonisation and 14 in the flats). Even so, the accuracy\npercentage is around 85%, which is a very good result. To analyse the sensitivity to the number of sensors, only two sensors were used, one on each side ). The results\nimproved, with a decrease in the number of misclassifications from 30 to 21 (13 for polygonisation and 8 for flats). One explanation could be the disparity in sensor sensitivity to the damage, where some sensors are more sensitive than others due to their spatial positioning in relation to the damage. By merging the data from the less sensitive sensors with the\nmore sensitive ones, this could have a negative impact on the results. Thus, the percentage\nThe purpose behind presenting these two plots was to demonstrate that, whether using 4 sensors or 2 sensors, the classification remains remarkably robust, showing lowAfter identifying the type of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed once again to\nclassify the severity of each damage separately. Regarding polygonal wheels, the classification involves both amplitude and harmonic orders, leading to the clusters depicted in the obtained clusters reasonably reflect the two amplitude groups, with all misclassifications associated with the H6-8 harmonic cases (17 misclassifications). Once the amplitude\nis identified, harmonic classification must be carried out separately for each of the amplitudes. In Figure 12b), related to amplitude A1, it is observed that the obtained clusters**Figure 11.** Automatic OOR damage classification based on cluster analysis using: a) 4 sensors; b) 2are nearly perfect, with only 3 misclassifications. In Figure 12c), there are only 3 misclassifications, totalling 8 misclassifications in the classification of the number of dominant\nThe classification of harmonic order is only possible with the separation of amplitudes,\nFigure 13 presents the clusters obtained for the wheel flat cases. The separation between\nthe less severe group and baseline cases and intermediate (cluster 3) and severe cases (cluster 4) is reduced, resulting in a total of 19 misclassifications. Nevertheless, this result showsrate of about 84%. One possible reason for this significant number of misclassifications could be directly associated with the number of impacts captured by the sensor.In order to contribute to the safety of railway transportation and service quality, an automatic methodology based on machine learning has been proposed. This methodology can accurately detect and classify two types of OOR wheel damage in railway vehicles allowing to mitigate problems at both track and vehicle level, such as derailments or material\ndegradation. It includes a new technique for feature extraction based on a dedicated neural network, the Sparse Autoencoder. This non-linear technique is an upgrade concerning the commonly used linear techniques for feature extraction since it allows a better normalisation of the operational effects in the analysed data, as well as the reduction of large amounts\nof data without relying on other techniques, while keeping the most valuable information. These improvements are achieved through the use of different hyperparameters in**Figure 12.** Automatic classification of polygonal wheels based on cluster analysis: a) amplitude A1-A2;**Figure 13.** Automatic classification of wheel flats based on cluster analysis.the calculations, such as non-linear activation functions and sparsity terms. Consequently,circulation. Particularly in the railway engineering field, the inclusion of this technique\nshowed a good potential to deal with variable train speeds, essentially due to the amplifying effect on the measured track dynamic responses which could induce errors in damage The application of the methodology to the data set proved to be very successful in detecting and classifying the two types of OOR damages. Damage detection was perfect, without\nany false detection. In terms of classifying the type of damage, the results are very good,\nwith a success rate of around 85%, but if only two accelerometers are considered the successrate increases to around 90%. These results are encouraging since the range of speeds considered in the analysis, between 60 and 100 km/h, is the most representative of in-service\nfreight trains. Also, the results show that including the Sparse Autoencoder has a positive\neffect in the normalization of the train speed in the damage data set.\nRegarding the severity classification for each type of damage, the methodology proved equally successful in clustering the different damage severities. For polygonal wheels, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the severity groups in terms of defect amplitude, failing only for the H6-8 harmonic cases, and in terms of harmonic orders for each amplitude,\nwith almost perfect results. For wheel flats, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the three severity groups, though with some misclassifications between the less severe group\nand baseline cases and between intermediate and severe cases. A success rate of around 86%\nis achieved in the classification of polygonal wheel severities and 84% in the classification of wheel flat severities. Even so, these high success rates of over 80% show the robustness\nof this methodology in damage classification regardless of the train speed.on on-site measurements. Additionally, this methodology could be carried out for other types of railway vehicles, for example, passenger vehicles, since the dynamic responses are\ndifferent from freight vehicles. In that case, exploring other recent types of autoencoders,\nTo increase the complexity of the problem, the objective is to explore the concept of\nmultiple damages (same or different OOR types). For this, it will be necessary to incorporate a new stage in the methodology, the damage location stage, which will make it possible\nto distinguish isolated damage from multiple damage, as well as their respective location.\nThus, damage will be identified using cut signals, which will then be used to classify theThis work is a result of project WAY4SafeRail-WAYside monitoring system FOR SAFE RAIL transportation, with reference NORTE-01-0247-FEDER-069595, co-funded by the European Regional\nDevelopment Fund (ERDF), through the North Portugal Regional Operational Programme\nPartnership Agreement.

Within this context,\nan unsupervised methodology based on artificial intelligence techniques is presented, which allows the detection and classification of wheels, based on dynamic responses induced on the track by crossing freight railway vehicles. The methodology involves the following\nsteps: (i) data collection and pre-processing, (ii) feature extraction (iii)\ndata fusion and (iv) feature discrimination. In the first phase, an FFT\nalgorithm is applied to the acceleration track responses. Then, features are extracted after training a Stacked Sparse Autoencoder, in which the main features of the responses are obtained after a compression stage using an encoder network. This lower dimensional\nlayer forces the model to learn a compression of the input data. Then,\nwhich enhances the sensitivity to the damage recognition. Posteriorly, an outlier analysis is performed to distinguish a healthy wheelRail vehicle wheels are subjected to constant wear and tear due to continuous use and inadequate maintenance plans. Over time, this wear and tear can generate more significant defects, so it is extremely important to use sensing to understand when maintenance of both the track and rolling stock is required. Over the last few decades, researchers havewayside systems, being the main difference in the location of the measuring devices. MostThe Author(s).

However, this type of system entail high costs envisaging the vehicle wheel condition monitoring, since sensors need to be installed in every vehicle in order to achieve a good representativity . On the other hand, wayside systems are a more viable solution for identifying wheel defects, since the condition of allThe most common wheel defects are known as OOR. As the name infers, this defect is related to deformations on the surface of the wheel circumference that make it not round.\nThis deformation can have many forms and different causes, leading to faults on the vehicle and on the track due to the higher dynamic force values [4–6]. The OOR damagesa function of their shape and size, vehicle characteristics and speed [7–10]. Wheel flats induce high dynamic impact loads on the railway infrastructure, which causes significant damage to both tracks and vehicles, such as broken axles, damaged rolling bearings and cracks in the wheels, rails and sleepers . Moreover, it also generates high vibrations\ntransmitted to the rolling stock, inducing significant stresses and causing damage to the In the case of polygonal wheels, the formation mechanism can be roughly classified\ninto three categories, namely, (1) initial wheel defects , (2) a natural vibration of the\nvehicle–track system and (3) thermoelastic instability . The formation mechanism is strongly contingent on the vehicle type and its operational characteristics, withof dominant harmonic orders [19–22]. For example, Tao et al. studied asymmetrical polygonal wear on metro wheels and obtained harmonic orders of 12–14, while another study by Tao et al. found that the most common harmonic order in Chinese freight trains is 18–19. Although a polygonal wheel could generate less impact on the track than a\nwheel flat, this defect can cause serious damage to the track due to resonance effects in the\nTo identify the occurrence of these OOR anomalies in train wheels, innovative\nmethodologies have been developed combining signal processing and automatic learning techniques. These methodologies are based on the extraction of damage sensitivity features, making possible the distinction between undamaged and damaged situations. Recently, many studies have shown good results in detecting OOR damages using\ndistinct approaches [24–29]. Mishra et al. concluded that a single FBG (Fiber Bragg Grating) sensor, positioned along the rail can detect the presence of wheel flats.\nLourenço et al. created an automatic algorithm for diagnosing OOR defects. The\nproposed methodology consists of isolating specific defective wheels and then identifying the severity of the damage, using only acceleration and strain data measured on\nthe track. In another study, Krummenacher et al. , proposed two machine-learningBy extracting the features, it is possible to transform the measured data into an alternative form of information where the correlation with damage is more easily observed. There are various techniques for feature extraction, the most common being CWT\n(continuous wavelet transform) [31–33], PCA (principal component analysis) ,detection of polygonal wheels on freight vehicles using CWT and ARX features, using\n6 accelerometers, 3 on each side of the railway track. Mosleh et al. introduced aflats by extracting AR features from acceleration records. Moreover, Mohammadi et al.\nadopted linear features, particularly, CWT, PCA, ARX and AR, and their research findingsin the context of wheel flat damage detection. Although these studies have demonstrated robust results in detection, they show some limitations in dealing with the non-linear effects associated with operational effects, such as the train speed. Due to the inability of these linear techniques to attenuate operation effects, the inclusion of different speeds\nFor most of these studies, a feature normalisation stage is used when it is necessary to remove the operational effects. Usually, latent variable methods are used, such as PCA or multiple linear regression (MLR) . Thus, to deal with the non-linear phenomena and reduce the large amounts of data without relying on the aforementioned methods,\nthe first artificial neural networks were created to inherently execute this task . Over the years, new and more advanced networks have been developed, with the Autoencoder\n(AE) being one of the main types. Later, Olshausen et al. proposed the creation of\nsparse coding and Ng et al. introduced a sparse penalisation term in the hidden layer,\nto acquire more compact and effective features from lower-dimensional data. For some datasets with complex relationships between characteristics, employing more than one SAE\nis necessary, which is why stacked sparse autoencoders (SSAE) are commonly used .\nNowadays, these types of AE are widely used in various scientific fields, but specifically\nfor structural engineering only a few studies are found, and most are about damage detection on bridges [45–47]. Amaral et al. , proposed an approach for detecting structural anomalies based on SAE and Shewhart’s T control chart. The characteristics extracted byin structures. In another similar study, Amaral et al. , applied the same approach to\na numerical model of a highway viaduct in Brazil reaching more than 99% of successful classifications of structural damage with the combination of SAE and Support Vector Machine. Pathirage et al. proposed a framework utilizing SAE’s potential for dimensionality reduction, which facilitated the assessment of damage detection performance on Many of these AE algorithms already performed feature classification in order to discriminate the different types of damages and severities. However, the AE methods can also be combined with other techniques commonly used to classify the data. They can be used unsupervised methods, in which the model is trained without any labels provided to the\ntraining dataset, such as k-means , self-organising maps (SOM) , isolation forest, gaussian mixture model , k-medoids and cluster analysis , or supervised\nmethods, which assume that the hierarchy of database categories is known, such as NaiveBayes classifiers , k-Nearest Neighbours classifiers , Support Vector Machinetwo types of OOR damages, flats and polygonal wheels, based on acceleration responses obtained from a virtual wayside monitoring system. The methodology comprises seven\nstages: (i) data collection, (ii) data pre-processing, (iii) training on a Stacked Sparse Autoencoder, (iv) feature extraction, (v) data fusion, (vi) outlier analysis and (vii) cluster analysis.\nThus, this numerical study aims to make innovative contributions to the current state of- Use of a Autoencoder neural network for feature extraction.

The application of sensors on both sides of theTo obtain the responses from the railway track, it is necessary to apply sensors on the track that can measure the dynamic responses of the crossing trains. As it is not always possible\nto install them due to the high costs involved, simulations have been carried out based on calibrated models of the track , vehicle and considering their dynamic interaction,\nas well as including the track irregularities. Simulations include cases with healthy wheelsTo simulate the dynamic interactions between the vehicle and the track, an in-house software VSI – Vehicle-Structure Interaction Analysis is used, which was initially developed by\nNeves et al. and later improved by Montenegro et al. .

The vehicle model integrates spring elements to simulate suspensions, mass elements to represent the mass and\ninertia at the centre of gravity of the wagon components. For the structural connection of these elements, rigid beam elements are adopted. Table 1 outlines the properties of the The Hertzian theory is applied to calculate the normal contact forces, while the USETABthe train to the track in the VSI software. Using Lagrange multipliers, this tool connects\nwheel displacements with the track nodal displacements, incorporating track irregularities and OOR profiles through a set of constraint equations. These equations are solved\nalongside equilibrium equations, forming a unified system that couples the two subsystems\n. Including the track irregularities directly in the constraint equations are beneficial since it avoids explicitly considering\nthem in the FEM model. Moreover, it also allows to include the wheel and OOR profiles as a periodic rail irregularity, simplifying the analysis. Thus, before starting the analysis, the\nVSI software imports track irregularities and OOR profiles from a MATLAB file, whichto the vertical and lateral irregularities in each rail in each respective position, and adds it to the constraint equations of the system throughout the dynamics analysis. Then, the\nsystem of dynamic equations is solved using the typical Newmark integration method.\nThe impact of track irregularity on wheel defect classification is significant, as a lower track quality tends to result in a higher likelihood of misclassification. A comprehensive\nexploration of this influence was previously undertaken by Mosleh et al. as documented in their research study . Hence, this study does not delve into the impact of track\nquality; rather, it primarily centres on the utilisation of AI-based methodologies for the detection and classification of wheel defects. For this, four different profiles are used, based\non European Standard EN 13848–2 . In this case, power spectral density (PSD) curvesFor OOR defects, several profiles are defined based on real measurements in representative profiles of the various severities. Subsequently, the structural matrices are imported\nMore details on track and train properties, including additional information on traintrack interaction, can be found in previous publications . Figure 1 shows the\nvehicle–track interaction model schematisation and some details about the train and track\nsubsystems, as well as the track irregularities and wheel-rail contact model.According to the conclusions reached in other studies with this type of damage ,\nthe most promising location of the sensors is on the rail. To reduce installation and maintenance costs, it is important to reduce the number of sensors without compromising the\nquality of the results. Therefore, based on a sensitivity analysis performed during the study,\nonly two vertical unidirectional accelerometers were used on each rail, 4 in total (A1 to A4),\nsince they provided a higher cost–benefit ratio. These sensors are mounted on the rail atdefects, different simulation scenarios with perfect wheels (baseline) and OOR wheels\n(damage) were defined for a five-wagon Laagrss freight train. Based on different crossing speeds, loading schemes and rail irregularities profiles, 120 baseline and 180 damage scenarios (90 for polygonal wheels and 90 for wheel flats) were defined, as summarised in For baseline scenarios, six loading schemes with five different speeds (40, 60, 80, 100\nand 120 km/h) and four rail irregularity profiles were considered, giving a total of 120 scenarios. The loading schemes used are: empty, half-loaded, full-loaded and, additionally,For the damage cases, a total of 90 scenarios were generated for polygonal wheels. These\nscenarios including 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (H1, H2 and H3) x 10 different irregularity profiles within each specified harmonic interval. In these 10 irregularity\nprofiles, based on the defect amplitude, two amplitudes are considered, five simulations for\nA1 and five simulations for A2. Similarly, 90 scenarios were created for wheel flats, involving 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (F1, F2 and F3) x 10 different irregularitywheel radius . This wave phenomenon can be characterised by the different wavelengths formed (harmonics θ ), and by the levels of irregularity ( Lw ) associated with each of the harmonics. According to Peng , it is considered a polygonal wheel when the wear amplitude assumes values above 0. mm and wavelengths between 140 mm and the wheelTo define scenarios with polygonal wheels for the Laagrss wagon, a literature survey on\nexperimental measurements in defective wheels was conducted . Three experimental irregularity profiles were collected, illustrated in Figure 3. The first group (H6-8)\ncorresponds to a study carried out by Cai et al. with dominant harmonics from 6 to 8;**Figure 3.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) of polygonal wheels with**Figure 4.** Examples of polygonal damage profiles for each of the dominant harmonic intervals.the second group (H12-14) to a study authored by Tao et al. with dominant harmonics from 12 to 14; and the third profile (H17-18) to a study performed by Wu et al. with\nBased on the wheel irregularity spectra ( Lw ) taken from the respective measurement profiles, shown in Figure 3, and considering the contribution of the first 30 harmonics, several irregularity profiles were generated, according to Figure 4.

A less severe group, with a 10–20 mm length, an intermediate group, with a 25–50 mm length and a more severe case, with a 55–100 mm length. The irregularity profiles are generated randomly, but in this case, in function of two geometric\nvariables, the length and the depth of the flat. More details about the process of generation of flat profiles can be found in the study performed by Mosleh et al .

The sampling frequency for data acquisition is considered 10 kHz in order to ensure a good problem Figure 6a) shows two baseline cases for two speeds (40 and 100 km/h), where it is possible to observe the influence of speed on the dynamic response. The amplifying effect\nof speed can influence the identification of damage, which is why a robust baseline with a wide range of scenarios is very important. At a speed of 40 km/h, lower accelerations\naround 0. m/s⊃2 are observed. In contrast, at a speed of 100 km/h (considerably higher),\naccelerations increase substantially to around 3. m/s⊃2. This illustrates the significant**Figure 6.** Acceleration time-series in sensor A1 for Laagrss vehicle: (a) influence of speed, (b) influencehigher speeds.

After obtaining the acceleration measurements from the numerical simulations, an FFT algorithm is applied to the time series allowing the conversion of the signal from the time domain to the frequency domain. Then,predefined hyperparameters of the algorithm. The set hyperparameters are encoding and\ndecoding transfer functions, hidden layer size, maximum number of epochs, L2 weight regularisation term, sparsity regularisation term and a sparsity proportion term. Afterwards,**Figure 7.** Flowchart with the main phases of the methodology for detection and classification of OORthe features are extracted in the more compressed layer of the SAE, the so-called bottleneck layer. The number of features obtained is equal to the number of hidden layers which\nis usually considerably lower than the data size, allowing a compression of the input data.\nFurthermore, to enhance the sensitivity to damage, two levels of data fusion are applied to the bottleneck features using the Mahalanobis distance. In the first level, all features are\nfused into a damage index (DI) for each sensor and, in the second level, all the sensors\nare merged resulting in only one DI for each simulation. Finally, automatic damage detection is achieved by performing an outlier analysis, in which a statistical confidence limit\n(CB) is used, based on the Inverse Cumulative Gaussian Distribution Function (ICDF).\nFor feature classification, an automatic clustering process based on the k-means technique is implemented. This algorithm allows for the unsupervised and automatic classification of data, based on the calculation of statistical distances between objects. In k-means technique given a vector of data and chosen k clusters, the key is to find k centroids that minimise\nthe distance of each vector to its nearest centroid . Since it is necessary to define the number of clusters in advance, a global Silhouette index (SIL) was adopted to make\nan automatic process. At the end, the clusters will allow the classification of the two typesbetween the number of correct classifications and the total number of cases.damage detection problems, as it allows a signal to be converted from the time domain to the frequency domain, to capture the excitation frequencies induced by the wheel defects.\nIn addition, a data reduction is carried out at this stage, since the initial records contain aa crossing speed of 80 km/h. When comparing the FFT spectra for a train passage with flats, Figure 8a), with polygonal wheels, Figure 8b), there are visible differences in terms\nof amplitude peak values and excited frequency ranges. For flats, the amplitude peak values are higher and they induce frequencies in the range between DC and 1500accordance with some authors reports . In terms of severities, for flats, the more severe group (55–100 mm) is the one with the higher frequency content, as expected,a baseline response. For polygonal wheels, from the analysis of Figure 8b), it can be seen the frequency peaks for the H12–14 and H17–18 profiles around 100 and 150\nrespectively, while for the profile H6-8 a more flat spectrum is obtained without showing any significant peak. This can be explained by the irregularity level profile of thisThese two graphs can show which frequencies have higher content in the original signal.Autoencoders are artificial neural networks trained using an unsupervised approach,\nwhich aim first to learn coded representations of the data, compressing the input into\na latent space representation, and second, through this compressed information, reconstructing the information. The basic architecture of this type of network consists of threewhere **Wij**, **Wjk** are the weights connection matrices between input layer-hidden\nlayer and hidden layer-output layer, **X** = ( **X** 1, **X** 2, . . ., **Xn** ) is the input data vector,\n**H** = ( **H** 1, . . ., **Hm** ) is the low-dimensional vector and **X** [ˆ] = ( **X** [ˆ] 1, **X** [ˆ] 2, . . ., **X** [ˆ] **n** ) is the output**Figure 8.** Frequency domain responses on position 1 for the crossing speed of 80 km/h: (a) wheel flats,data vector. **b** 1, **b** 2 are bias vectors and σ 1, σ 2 are the activation function used in each of thereconstruction of the input X [ˆ], as shown in Equation (3).

After incorporating various inputs into the SSAE training, they are integrated into the so-called\n‘Input 1’. As training progresses, the data is compressed, and the main characteristics of the signals are obtained and retained in ‘Bottleneck 1’. Subsequently, these characteristics are\nused as input for training the second sparse autoencoder, which, after further compression,\nenables the extraction of the final features. Depending on the type of data under analysis,\nthe compression level differs, so multiple tests should be conducted to optimise these layer sizes. This optimisation was achieved by trial and test, changing both the size of the first\nIt should be noted that this network architecture, where the dimensions of the layers gradually decrease along the network until reaching the bottleneck layer , has proven\nto be highly robust for the type of data used. It allows for effective compression of results**Figure 9.** Schematic of the structure of the SSAE neural network used in this study.After extracting the features from the bottleneck layer of the SSAE, the difference between the healthy wheels scenarios and the damage wheels scenarios is still not sufficient. Hence\na data fusion is performed. With this fusion, it is possible to increase the sensitivity of the\nfeatures, and as a result, to obtain a damage index (DI) for each simulation. Thus, the Mahalanobis distance (MD) is used to reduce the volume of extracted data and preserve the most relevant information . Briefly, MD is a metric that measures the distance between two points in a feature space consisting of two or more variables, being independent of the\nscale of the features, thus allowing an increase in the sensitivity of the features to cases with damage. The MD, denoted here as DI, is calculated for each simulation using the followingin which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−], and ¯ x is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The MD is calculated for each sensor and for each simulation, obtaining a matrix of n distances per k number of sensors.Finally, the discrimination of the features consists in distinguishing the features as corresponding to a healthy or damaged case. At this stage of the methodology, an analysis of\nabnormal values is carried out, which will allow the condition of the train wheels to beautomatically monitored and these values to be classified into different classes. This phaseThe outlier analysis consists of grouping, by probabilistic distribution processes, the datato the previously created group. For this, a statistical confidence limit (CB) is used, based on the inverse cumulative Gaussian distribution function (ICDF), considering the mean\nvalue, ¯ μ, and standard deviation, σ, of the baseline feature vector.Whenever a value of a DI indicator is equal to or greater than CB, it is considered an outlier (the null hypothesis is rejected), thus representing a case of damage.For feature classification, a clustering process is used to divide the dataset into distinct clusters that should be as compact and separated as possible . For clustering, the k-meanson the distances of their vectors. Recent studies showed that the k-means algorithm has shown promising results . The main limitation of this technique is that it requires\nknowledge of the number of clusters in advance. For this purpose, the global silhouetteThis section presents the main results obtained through the application of the methodology proposed in section 3 to the calculated track responses. The methodology is applied using damaged wheel passages for the three simulated train speeds (60, 80 and 100 km/h),hyperparameters (presented in section 3). By adjusting these hyperparameters, it is possible to make the algorithm more efficient and improve the generalisation capabilities, as only\nthe most important features are retained. The optimisation of these hyperparameters isof data under analysis. Based on the principles of the SAE already outlined in other works\nIn the context of this study, the non-linear transfer functions (logsig) proved to be more effective than the linear ones, being the ones used in all the studied cases. After analysing Table 3, there is a similarity in the hyperparameters when comparing the two types of OOR damage. It is observed that the data compression level is the same for both cases, around\n93%, as 500 features are extracted in Bottleneck 2 from the initial input data with 7000\nConcerning the type of damage situation, the size of the ‘Bottleneck 1’ and ‘Bottleneck\n2’ was increased to bring them even closer to the initial amount of input data. This can beanalysis, making it challenging for the autoencoder to define relationships between the data, hence requiring a larger number. On the contrary, the maximum number of epochsIt is also important to emphasise that of the various hyperparameters presented, theOnce the hyperparameters have been defined, all the steps of the methodology are applied to the new dataset. For simplicity, in this section, only the last phase of the methodology will be presented, namely an outlier analysis for damage detection and cluster analysis for damage classification. For each sensor, a matrix n × m is created, where n\nis the number of test passages (baseline scenarios + damage scenarios), and m represents the number of extracted features. So, the size of the matrices is 210 × 2000 in case of the\ntype of damage, 75 × 500 for each amplitude in polygonal wheel, and 120 × 500 for wheelDespite the visual distinction between healthy and damaged wheels based on the data processing presented in subsection 3.2, unsupervised learning must use strategies capable of automatically detecting damage. To this end, an outlier analysis is employed, which consists of defining a confidence threshold using a significance level of 1% , represented**Figure 10.** Automatic OOR damage detection based on outlier analysis.by the green line in Figure 10. This approach makes it possible to successfully detect allTo distinguish the two types of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed. Figure 11\nshows a clear distinction between the damage, even when using a dataset with three different train speeds (60,80 and 100 km/h).. In the case of Figure 11a), using all four\naccelerometers, it is possible to efficiently separate the set into two large clusters, despite\n30 misclassifications (16 in the polygonisation and 14 in the flats). Even so, the accuracy\npercentage is around 85%, which is a very good result. To analyse the sensitivity to the number of sensors, only two sensors were used, one on each side ). The results\nimproved, with a decrease in the number of misclassifications from 30 to 21 (13 for polygonisation and 8 for flats). One explanation could be the disparity in sensor sensitivity to the damage, where some sensors are more sensitive than others due to their spatial positioning in relation to the damage. By merging the data from the less sensitive sensors with the\nmore sensitive ones, this could have a negative impact on the results. Thus, the percentage\nThe purpose behind presenting these two plots was to demonstrate that, whether using 4 sensors or 2 sensors, the classification remains remarkably robust, showing lowAfter identifying the type of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed once again to\nclassify the severity of each damage separately. Regarding polygonal wheels, the classification involves both amplitude and harmonic orders, leading to the clusters depicted in the obtained clusters reasonably reflect the two amplitude groups, with all misclassifications associated with the H6-8 harmonic cases (17 misclassifications). Once the amplitude\nis identified, harmonic classification must be carried out separately for each of the amplitudes. In Figure 12b), related to amplitude A1, it is observed that the obtained clusters**Figure 11.** Automatic OOR damage classification based on cluster analysis using: a) 4 sensors; b) 2are nearly perfect, with only 3 misclassifications. In Figure 12c), there are only 3 misclassifications, totalling 8 misclassifications in the classification of the number of dominant\nThe classification of harmonic order is only possible with the separation of amplitudes,\nFigure 13 presents the clusters obtained for the wheel flat cases. The separation between\nthe less severe group and baseline cases and intermediate (cluster 3) and severe cases (cluster 4) is reduced, resulting in a total of 19 misclassifications. Nevertheless, this result showsrate of about 84%. One possible reason for this significant number of misclassifications could be directly associated with the number of impacts captured by the sensor.In order to contribute to the safety of railway transportation and service quality, an automatic methodology based on machine learning has been proposed. This methodology can accurately detect and classify two types of OOR wheel damage in railway vehicles allowing to mitigate problems at both track and vehicle level, such as derailments or material\ndegradation. It includes a new technique for feature extraction based on a dedicated neural network, the Sparse Autoencoder. This non-linear technique is an upgrade concerning the commonly used linear techniques for feature extraction since it allows a better normalisation of the operational effects in the analysed data, as well as the reduction of large amounts\nof data without relying on other techniques, while keeping the most valuable information. These improvements are achieved through the use of different hyperparameters in**Figure 12.** Automatic classification of polygonal wheels based on cluster analysis: a) amplitude A1-A2;**Figure 13.** Automatic classification of wheel flats based on cluster analysis.the calculations, such as non-linear activation functions and sparsity terms. Consequently,circulation. Particularly in the railway engineering field, the inclusion of this technique\nshowed a good potential to deal with variable train speeds, essentially due to the amplifying effect on the measured track dynamic responses which could induce errors in damage The application of the methodology to the data set proved to be very successful in detecting and classifying the two types of OOR damages. Damage detection was perfect, without\nany false detection. In terms of classifying the type of damage, the results are very good,\nwith a success rate of around 85%, but if only two accelerometers are considered the successrate increases to around 90%. These results are encouraging since the range of speeds considered in the analysis, between 60 and 100 km/h, is the most representative of in-service\nfreight trains. Also, the results show that including the Sparse Autoencoder has a positive\neffect in the normalization of the train speed in the damage data set.\nRegarding the severity classification for each type of damage, the methodology proved equally successful in clustering the different damage severities. For polygonal wheels, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the severity groups in terms of defect amplitude, failing only for the H6-8 harmonic cases, and in terms of harmonic orders for each amplitude,\nwith almost perfect results. For wheel flats, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the three severity groups, though with some misclassifications between the less severe group\nand baseline cases and between intermediate and severe cases. A success rate of around 86%\nis achieved in the classification of polygonal wheel severities and 84% in the classification of wheel flat severities. Even so, these high success rates of over 80% show the robustness\nof this methodology in damage classification regardless of the train speed.on on-site measurements. Additionally, this methodology could be carried out for other types of railway vehicles, for example, passenger vehicles, since the dynamic responses are\ndifferent from freight vehicles. In that case, exploring other recent types of autoencoders,\nTo increase the complexity of the problem, the objective is to explore the concept of\nmultiple damages (same or different OOR types). For this, it will be necessary to incorporate a new stage in the methodology, the damage location stage, which will make it possible\nto distinguish isolated damage from multiple damage, as well as their respective location.\nThus, damage will be identified using cut signals, which will then be used to classify theThis work is a result of project WAY4SafeRail-WAYside monitoring system FOR SAFE RAIL transportation, with reference NORTE-01-0247-FEDER-069595, co-funded by the European Regional\nDevelopment Fund (ERDF), through the North Portugal Regional Operational Programme\nPartnership Agreement.

Within this context,\nan unsupervised methodology based on artificial intelligence techniques is presented, which allows the detection and classification of wheels, based on dynamic responses induced on the track by crossing freight railway vehicles. The methodology involves the following\nsteps: (i) data collection and pre-processing, (ii) feature extraction (iii)\ndata fusion and (iv) feature discrimination. In the first phase, an FFT\nalgorithm is applied to the acceleration track responses. Then, features are extracted after training a Stacked Sparse Autoencoder, in which the main features of the responses are obtained after a compression stage using an encoder network. This lower dimensional\nlayer forces the model to learn a compression of the input data. Then,\nwhich enhances the sensitivity to the damage recognition. Posteriorly, an outlier analysis is performed to distinguish a healthy wheelRail vehicle wheels are subjected to constant wear and tear due to continuous use and inadequate maintenance plans. Over time, this wear and tear can generate more significant defects, so it is extremely important to use sensing to understand when maintenance of both the track and rolling stock is required.

However, this type of system entail high costs envisaging the vehicle wheel condition monitoring, since sensors need to be installed in every vehicle in order to achieve a good representativity . On the other hand, wayside systems are a more viable solution for identifying wheel defects, since the condition of allThe most common wheel defects are known as OOR. As the name infers, this defect is related to deformations on the surface of the wheel circumference that make it not round.\nThis deformation can have many forms and different causes, leading to faults on the vehicle and on the track due to the higher dynamic force values [4–6]. The OOR damagesa function of their shape and size, vehicle characteristics and speed [7–10]. Wheel flats induce high dynamic impact loads on the railway infrastructure, which causes significant damage to both tracks and vehicles, such as broken axles, damaged rolling bearings and cracks in the wheels, rails and sleepers . Moreover, it also generates high vibrations\ntransmitted to the rolling stock, inducing significant stresses and causing damage to the In the case of polygonal wheels, the formation mechanism can be roughly classified\ninto three categories, namely, (1) initial wheel defects , (2) a natural vibration of the\nvehicle–track system and (3) thermoelastic instability . The formation mechanism is strongly contingent on the vehicle type and its operational characteristics, withof dominant harmonic orders [19–22]. For example, Tao et al. studied asymmetrical polygonal wear on metro wheels and obtained harmonic orders of 12–14, while another study by Tao et al. found that the most common harmonic order in Chinese freight trains is 18–19. Although a polygonal wheel could generate less impact on the track than a\nwheel flat, this defect can cause serious damage to the track due to resonance effects in the\nTo identify the occurrence of these OOR anomalies in train wheels, innovative\nmethodologies have been developed combining signal processing and automatic learning techniques. These methodologies are based on the extraction of damage sensitivity features, making possible the distinction between undamaged and damaged situations. Recently, many studies have shown good results in detecting OOR damages using\ndistinct approaches [24–29]. Mishra et al. concluded that a single FBG (Fiber Bragg Grating) sensor, positioned along the rail can detect the presence of wheel flats.\nLourenço et al. created an automatic algorithm for diagnosing OOR defects. The\nproposed methodology consists of isolating specific defective wheels and then identifying the severity of the damage, using only acceleration and strain data measured on\nthe track. In another study, Krummenacher et al. , proposed two machine-learningBy extracting the features, it is possible to transform the measured data into an alternative form of information where the correlation with damage is more easily observed. There are various techniques for feature extraction, the most common being CWT\n(continuous wavelet transform) [31–33], PCA (principal component analysis) ,detection of polygonal wheels on freight vehicles using CWT and ARX features, using\n6 accelerometers, 3 on each side of the railway track. Mosleh et al. introduced aflats by extracting AR features from acceleration records. Moreover, Mohammadi et al.\nadopted linear features, particularly, CWT, PCA, ARX and AR, and their research findingsin the context of wheel flat damage detection. Although these studies have demonstrated robust results in detection, they show some limitations in dealing with the non-linear effects associated with operational effects, such as the train speed. Due to the inability of these linear techniques to attenuate operation effects, the inclusion of different speeds\nFor most of these studies, a feature normalisation stage is used when it is necessary to remove the operational effects. Usually, latent variable methods are used, such as PCA or multiple linear regression (MLR) . Thus, to deal with the non-linear phenomena and reduce the large amounts of data without relying on the aforementioned methods,\nthe first artificial neural networks were created to inherently execute this task . Over the years, new and more advanced networks have been developed, with the Autoencoder\n(AE) being one of the main types. Later, Olshausen et al. proposed the creation of\nsparse coding and Ng et al. introduced a sparse penalisation term in the hidden layer,\nto acquire more compact and effective features from lower-dimensional data. For some datasets with complex relationships between characteristics, employing more than one SAE\nis necessary, which is why stacked sparse autoencoders (SSAE) are commonly used .\nNowadays, these types of AE are widely used in various scientific fields, but specifically\nfor structural engineering only a few studies are found, and most are about damage detection on bridges [45–47].

Pathirage et al. proposed a framework utilizing SAE’s potential for dimensionality reduction, which facilitated the assessment of damage detection performance on Many of these AE algorithms already performed feature classification in order to discriminate the different types of damages and severities. However, the AE methods can also be combined with other techniques commonly used to classify the data. They can be used unsupervised methods, in which the model is trained without any labels provided to the\ntraining dataset, such as k-means , self-organising maps (SOM) , isolation forest, gaussian mixture model , k-medoids and cluster analysis , or supervised\nmethods, which assume that the hierarchy of database categories is known, such as NaiveBayes classifiers , k-Nearest Neighbours classifiers , Support Vector Machinetwo types of OOR damages, flats and polygonal wheels, based on acceleration responses obtained from a virtual wayside monitoring system.

The application of sensors on both sides of theTo obtain the responses from the railway track, it is necessary to apply sensors on the track that can measure the dynamic responses of the crossing trains. As it is not always possible\nto install them due to the high costs involved, simulations have been carried out based on calibrated models of the track , vehicle and considering their dynamic interaction,\nas well as including the track irregularities. Simulations include cases with healthy wheelsTo simulate the dynamic interactions between the vehicle and the track, an in-house software VSI – Vehicle-Structure Interaction Analysis is used, which was initially developed by\nNeves et al. and later improved by Montenegro et al. .

Including the track irregularities directly in the constraint equations are beneficial since it avoids explicitly considering\nthem in the FEM model. Moreover, it also allows to include the wheel and OOR profiles as a periodic rail irregularity, simplifying the analysis. Thus, before starting the analysis, the\nVSI software imports track irregularities and OOR profiles from a MATLAB file, whichto the vertical and lateral irregularities in each rail in each respective position, and adds it to the constraint equations of the system throughout the dynamics analysis. Then, the\nsystem of dynamic equations is solved using the typical Newmark integration method.\nThe impact of track irregularity on wheel defect classification is significant, as a lower track quality tends to result in a higher likelihood of misclassification. A comprehensive\nexploration of this influence was previously undertaken by Mosleh et al. as documented in their research study . Hence, this study does not delve into the impact of track\nquality; rather, it primarily centres on the utilisation of AI-based methodologies for the detection and classification of wheel defects. For this, four different profiles are used, based\non European Standard EN 13848–2 . In this case, power spectral density (PSD) curvesFor OOR defects, several profiles are defined based on real measurements in representative profiles of the various severities. Subsequently, the structural matrices are imported\nMore details on track and train properties, including additional information on traintrack interaction, can be found in previous publications . Figure 1 shows the\nvehicle–track interaction model schematisation and some details about the train and track\nsubsystems, as well as the track irregularities and wheel-rail contact model.According to the conclusions reached in other studies with this type of damage ,\nthe most promising location of the sensors is on the rail. To reduce installation and maintenance costs, it is important to reduce the number of sensors without compromising the\nquality of the results. Therefore, based on a sensitivity analysis performed during the study,\nonly two vertical unidirectional accelerometers were used on each rail, 4 in total (A1 to A4),\nsince they provided a higher cost–benefit ratio. These sensors are mounted on the rail atdefects, different simulation scenarios with perfect wheels (baseline) and OOR wheels\n(damage) were defined for a five-wagon Laagrss freight train. Based on different crossing speeds, loading schemes and rail irregularities profiles, 120 baseline and 180 damage scenarios (90 for polygonal wheels and 90 for wheel flats) were defined, as summarised in For baseline scenarios, six loading schemes with five different speeds (40, 60, 80, 100\nand 120 km/h) and four rail irregularity profiles were considered, giving a total of 120 scenarios. The loading schemes used are: empty, half-loaded, full-loaded and, additionally,For the damage cases, a total of 90 scenarios were generated for polygonal wheels. These\nscenarios including 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (H1, H2 and H3) x 10 different irregularity profiles within each specified harmonic interval. In these 10 irregularity\nprofiles, based on the defect amplitude, two amplitudes are considered, five simulations for\nA1 and five simulations for A2. Similarly, 90 scenarios were created for wheel flats, involving 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (F1, F2 and F3) x 10 different irregularitywheel radius . This wave phenomenon can be characterised by the different wavelengths formed (harmonics θ ), and by the levels of irregularity ( Lw ) associated with each of the harmonics.

Three experimental irregularity profiles were collected, illustrated in Figure 3. The first group (H6-8)\ncorresponds to a study carried out by Cai et al. with dominant harmonics from 6 to 8;**Figure 3.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) of polygonal wheels with**Figure 4.** Examples of polygonal damage profiles for each of the dominant harmonic intervals.the second group (H12-14) to a study authored by Tao et al. with dominant harmonics from 12 to 14; and the third profile (H17-18) to a study performed by Wu et al. with\nBased on the wheel irregularity spectra ( Lw ) taken from the respective measurement profiles, shown in Figure 3, and considering the contribution of the first 30 harmonics, several irregularity profiles were generated, according to Figure 4.

After obtaining the acceleration measurements from the numerical simulations, an FFT algorithm is applied to the time series allowing the conversion of the signal from the time domain to the frequency domain. Then,predefined hyperparameters of the algorithm. The set hyperparameters are encoding and\ndecoding transfer functions, hidden layer size, maximum number of epochs, L2 weight regularisation term, sparsity regularisation term and a sparsity proportion term. Afterwards,**Figure 7.** Flowchart with the main phases of the methodology for detection and classification of OORthe features are extracted in the more compressed layer of the SAE, the so-called bottleneck layer. The number of features obtained is equal to the number of hidden layers which\nis usually considerably lower than the data size, allowing a compression of the input data.\nFurthermore, to enhance the sensitivity to damage, two levels of data fusion are applied to the bottleneck features using the Mahalanobis distance. In the first level, all features are\nfused into a damage index (DI) for each sensor and, in the second level, all the sensors\nare merged resulting in only one DI for each simulation. Finally, automatic damage detection is achieved by performing an outlier analysis, in which a statistical confidence limit\n(CB) is used, based on the Inverse Cumulative Gaussian Distribution Function (ICDF).\nFor feature classification, an automatic clustering process based on the k-means technique is implemented. This algorithm allows for the unsupervised and automatic classification of data, based on the calculation of statistical distances between objects. In k-means technique given a vector of data and chosen k clusters, the key is to find k centroids that minimise\nthe distance of each vector to its nearest centroid . Since it is necessary to define the number of clusters in advance, a global Silhouette index (SIL) was adopted to make\nan automatic process. At the end, the clusters will allow the classification of the two typesbetween the number of correct classifications and the total number of cases.damage detection problems, as it allows a signal to be converted from the time domain to the frequency domain, to capture the excitation frequencies induced by the wheel defects.\nIn addition, a data reduction is carried out at this stage, since the initial records contain aa crossing speed of 80 km/h. When comparing the FFT spectra for a train passage with flats, Figure 8a), with polygonal wheels, Figure 8b), there are visible differences in terms\nof amplitude peak values and excited frequency ranges. For flats, the amplitude peak values are higher and they induce frequencies in the range between DC and 1500accordance with some authors reports . In terms of severities, for flats, the more severe group (55–100 mm) is the one with the higher frequency content, as expected,a baseline response. For polygonal wheels, from the analysis of Figure 8b), it can be seen the frequency peaks for the H12–14 and H17–18 profiles around 100 and 150\nrespectively, while for the profile H6-8 a more flat spectrum is obtained without showing any significant peak. This can be explained by the irregularity level profile of thisThese two graphs can show which frequencies have higher content in the original signal.Autoencoders are artificial neural networks trained using an unsupervised approach,\nwhich aim first to learn coded representations of the data, compressing the input into\na latent space representation, and second, through this compressed information, reconstructing the information. The basic architecture of this type of network consists of threewhere **Wij**, **Wjk** are the weights connection matrices between input layer-hidden\nlayer and hidden layer-output layer, **X** = ( **X** 1, **X** 2, . . ., **Xn** ) is the input data vector,\n**H** = ( **H** 1, . . ., **Hm** ) is the low-dimensional vector and **X** [ˆ] = ( **X** [ˆ] 1, **X** [ˆ] 2, . . ., **X** [ˆ] **n** ) is the output**Figure 8.** Frequency domain responses on position 1 for the crossing speed of 80 km/h: (a) wheel flats,data vector. **b** 1, **b** 2 are bias vectors and σ 1, σ 2 are the activation function used in each of thereconstruction of the input X [ˆ], as shown in Equation (3).

After incorporating various inputs into the SSAE training, they are integrated into the so-called\n‘Input 1’. As training progresses, the data is compressed, and the main characteristics of the signals are obtained and retained in ‘Bottleneck 1’. Subsequently, these characteristics are\nused as input for training the second sparse autoencoder, which, after further compression,\nenables the extraction of the final features. Depending on the type of data under analysis,\nthe compression level differs, so multiple tests should be conducted to optimise these layer sizes. This optimisation was achieved by trial and test, changing both the size of the first\nIt should be noted that this network architecture, where the dimensions of the layers gradually decrease along the network until reaching the bottleneck layer , has proven\nto be highly robust for the type of data used. It allows for effective compression of results**Figure 9.** Schematic of the structure of the SSAE neural network used in this study.After extracting the features from the bottleneck layer of the SSAE, the difference between the healthy wheels scenarios and the damage wheels scenarios is still not sufficient. Hence\na data fusion is performed. With this fusion, it is possible to increase the sensitivity of the\nfeatures, and as a result, to obtain a damage index (DI) for each simulation. Thus, the Mahalanobis distance (MD) is used to reduce the volume of extracted data and preserve the most relevant information . Briefly, MD is a metric that measures the distance between two points in a feature space consisting of two or more variables, being independent of the\nscale of the features, thus allowing an increase in the sensitivity of the features to cases with damage. The MD, denoted here as DI, is calculated for each simulation using the followingin which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−], and ¯ x is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The MD is calculated for each sensor and for each simulation, obtaining a matrix of n distances per k number of sensors.Finally, the discrimination of the features consists in distinguishing the features as corresponding to a healthy or damaged case. At this stage of the methodology, an analysis of\nabnormal values is carried out, which will allow the condition of the train wheels to beautomatically monitored and these values to be classified into different classes. This phaseThe outlier analysis consists of grouping, by probabilistic distribution processes, the datato the previously created group. For this, a statistical confidence limit (CB) is used, based on the inverse cumulative Gaussian distribution function (ICDF), considering the mean\nvalue, ¯ μ, and standard deviation, σ, of the baseline feature vector.Whenever a value of a DI indicator is equal to or greater than CB, it is considered an outlier (the null hypothesis is rejected), thus representing a case of damage.For feature classification, a clustering process is used to divide the dataset into distinct clusters that should be as compact and separated as possible . For clustering, the k-meanson the distances of their vectors. Recent studies showed that the k-means algorithm has shown promising results . The main limitation of this technique is that it requires\nknowledge of the number of clusters in advance. For this purpose, the global silhouetteThis section presents the main results obtained through the application of the methodology proposed in section 3 to the calculated track responses. The methodology is applied using damaged wheel passages for the three simulated train speeds (60, 80 and 100 km/h),hyperparameters (presented in section 3). By adjusting these hyperparameters, it is possible to make the algorithm more efficient and improve the generalisation capabilities, as only\nthe most important features are retained. The optimisation of these hyperparameters isof data under analysis. Based on the principles of the SAE already outlined in other works\nIn the context of this study, the non-linear transfer functions (logsig) proved to be more effective than the linear ones, being the ones used in all the studied cases. After analysing Table 3, there is a similarity in the hyperparameters when comparing the two types of OOR damage. It is observed that the data compression level is the same for both cases, around\n93%, as 500 features are extracted in Bottleneck 2 from the initial input data with 7000\nConcerning the type of damage situation, the size of the ‘Bottleneck 1’ and ‘Bottleneck\n2’ was increased to bring them even closer to the initial amount of input data. This can beanalysis, making it challenging for the autoencoder to define relationships between the data, hence requiring a larger number. On the contrary, the maximum number of epochsIt is also important to emphasise that of the various hyperparameters presented, theOnce the hyperparameters have been defined, all the steps of the methodology are applied to the new dataset. For simplicity, in this section, only the last phase of the methodology will be presented, namely an outlier analysis for damage detection and cluster analysis for damage classification. For each sensor, a matrix n × m is created, where n\nis the number of test passages (baseline scenarios + damage scenarios), and m represents the number of extracted features. So, the size of the matrices is 210 × 2000 in case of the\ntype of damage, 75 × 500 for each amplitude in polygonal wheel, and 120 × 500 for wheelDespite the visual distinction between healthy and damaged wheels based on the data processing presented in subsection 3.2, unsupervised learning must use strategies capable of automatically detecting damage. To this end, an outlier analysis is employed, which consists of defining a confidence threshold using a significance level of 1% , represented**Figure 10.** Automatic OOR damage detection based on outlier analysis.by the green line in Figure 10. This approach makes it possible to successfully detect allTo distinguish the two types of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed. Figure 11\nshows a clear distinction between the damage, even when using a dataset with three different train speeds (60,80 and 100 km/h).. In the case of Figure 11a), using all four\naccelerometers, it is possible to efficiently separate the set into two large clusters, despite\n30 misclassifications (16 in the polygonisation and 14 in the flats). Even so, the accuracy\npercentage is around 85%, which is a very good result. To analyse the sensitivity to the number of sensors, only two sensors were used, one on each side ). The results\nimproved, with a decrease in the number of misclassifications from 30 to 21 (13 for polygonisation and 8 for flats). One explanation could be the disparity in sensor sensitivity to the damage, where some sensors are more sensitive than others due to their spatial positioning in relation to the damage. By merging the data from the less sensitive sensors with the\nmore sensitive ones, this could have a negative impact on the results. Thus, the percentage\nThe purpose behind presenting these two plots was to demonstrate that, whether using 4 sensors or 2 sensors, the classification remains remarkably robust, showing lowAfter identifying the type of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed once again to\nclassify the severity of each damage separately. Regarding polygonal wheels, the classification involves both amplitude and harmonic orders, leading to the clusters depicted in the obtained clusters reasonably reflect the two amplitude groups, with all misclassifications associated with the H6-8 harmonic cases (17 misclassifications). Once the amplitude\nis identified, harmonic classification must be carried out separately for each of the amplitudes. In Figure 12b), related to amplitude A1, it is observed that the obtained clusters**Figure 11.** Automatic OOR damage classification based on cluster analysis using: a) 4 sensors; b) 2are nearly perfect, with only 3 misclassifications. In Figure 12c), there are only 3 misclassifications, totalling 8 misclassifications in the classification of the number of dominant\nThe classification of harmonic order is only possible with the separation of amplitudes,\nFigure 13 presents the clusters obtained for the wheel flat cases. The separation between\nthe less severe group and baseline cases and intermediate (cluster 3) and severe cases (cluster 4) is reduced, resulting in a total of 19 misclassifications. Nevertheless, this result showsrate of about 84%. One possible reason for this significant number of misclassifications could be directly associated with the number of impacts captured by the sensor.In order to contribute to the safety of railway transportation and service quality, an automatic methodology based on machine learning has been proposed. This methodology can accurately detect and classify two types of OOR wheel damage in railway vehicles allowing to mitigate problems at both track and vehicle level, such as derailments or material\ndegradation. It includes a new technique for feature extraction based on a dedicated neural network, the Sparse Autoencoder. This non-linear technique is an upgrade concerning the commonly used linear techniques for feature extraction since it allows a better normalisation of the operational effects in the analysed data, as well as the reduction of large amounts\nof data without relying on other techniques, while keeping the most valuable information. These improvements are achieved through the use of different hyperparameters in**Figure 12.** Automatic classification of polygonal wheels based on cluster analysis: a) amplitude A1-A2;**Figure 13.** Automatic classification of wheel flats based on cluster analysis.the calculations, such as non-linear activation functions and sparsity terms. Consequently,circulation. Particularly in the railway engineering field, the inclusion of this technique\nshowed a good potential to deal with variable train speeds, essentially due to the amplifying effect on the measured track dynamic responses which could induce errors in damage The application of the methodology to the data set proved to be very successful in detecting and classifying the two types of OOR damages. Damage detection was perfect, without\nany false detection. In terms of classifying the type of damage, the results are very good,\nwith a success rate of around 85%, but if only two accelerometers are considered the successrate increases to around 90%. These results are encouraging since the range of speeds considered in the analysis, between 60 and 100 km/h, is the most representative of in-service\nfreight trains. Also, the results show that including the Sparse Autoencoder has a positive\neffect in the normalization of the train speed in the damage data set.\nRegarding the severity classification for each type of damage, the methodology proved equally successful in clustering the different damage severities. For polygonal wheels, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the severity groups in terms of defect amplitude, failing only for the H6-8 harmonic cases, and in terms of harmonic orders for each amplitude,\nwith almost perfect results. For wheel flats, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the three severity groups, though with some misclassifications between the less severe group\nand baseline cases and between intermediate and severe cases. A success rate of around 86%\nis achieved in the classification of polygonal wheel severities and 84% in the classification of wheel flat severities. Even so, these high success rates of over 80% show the robustness\nof this methodology in damage classification regardless of the train speed.on on-site measurements. Additionally, this methodology could be carried out for other types of railway vehicles, for example, passenger vehicles, since the dynamic responses are\ndifferent from freight vehicles. In that case, exploring other recent types of autoencoders,\nTo increase the complexity of the problem, the objective is to explore the concept of\nmultiple damages (same or different OOR types). For this, it will be necessary to incorporate a new stage in the methodology, the damage location stage, which will make it possible\nto distinguish isolated damage from multiple damage, as well as their respective location.\nThus, damage will be identified using cut signals, which will then be used to classify theThis work is a result of project WAY4SafeRail-WAYside monitoring system FOR SAFE RAIL transportation, with reference NORTE-01-0247-FEDER-069595, co-funded by the European Regional\nDevelopment Fund (ERDF), through the North Portugal Regional Operational Programme\nPartnership Agreement.

However, this type of system entail high costs envisaging the vehicle wheel condition monitoring, since sensors need to be installed in every vehicle in order to achieve a good representativity . On the other hand, wayside systems are a more viable solution for identifying wheel defects, since the condition of allThe most common wheel defects are known as OOR. As the name infers, this defect is related to deformations on the surface of the wheel circumference that make it not round.\nThis deformation can have many forms and different causes, leading to faults on the vehicle and on the track due to the higher dynamic force values [4–6]. The OOR damagesa function of their shape and size, vehicle characteristics and speed [7–10]. Wheel flats induce high dynamic impact loads on the railway infrastructure, which causes significant damage to both tracks and vehicles, such as broken axles, damaged rolling bearings and cracks in the wheels, rails and sleepers . Moreover, it also generates high vibrations\ntransmitted to the rolling stock, inducing significant stresses and causing damage to the In the case of polygonal wheels, the formation mechanism can be roughly classified\ninto three categories, namely, (1) initial wheel defects , (2) a natural vibration of the\nvehicle–track system and (3) thermoelastic instability . The formation mechanism is strongly contingent on the vehicle type and its operational characteristics, withof dominant harmonic orders [19–22]. For example, Tao et al. studied asymmetrical polygonal wear on metro wheels and obtained harmonic orders of 12–14, while another study by Tao et al. found that the most common harmonic order in Chinese freight trains is 18–19. Although a polygonal wheel could generate less impact on the track than a\nwheel flat, this defect can cause serious damage to the track due to resonance effects in the\nTo identify the occurrence of these OOR anomalies in train wheels, innovative\nmethodologies have been developed combining signal processing and automatic learning techniques. These methodologies are based on the extraction of damage sensitivity features, making possible the distinction between undamaged and damaged situations. Recently, many studies have shown good results in detecting OOR damages using\ndistinct approaches [24–29]. Mishra et al. concluded that a single FBG (Fiber Bragg Grating) sensor, positioned along the rail can detect the presence of wheel flats.\nLourenço et al. created an automatic algorithm for diagnosing OOR defects. The\nproposed methodology consists of isolating specific defective wheels and then identifying the severity of the damage, using only acceleration and strain data measured on\nthe track. In another study, Krummenacher et al. , proposed two machine-learningBy extracting the features, it is possible to transform the measured data into an alternative form of information where the correlation with damage is more easily observed. There are various techniques for feature extraction, the most common being CWT\n(continuous wavelet transform) [31–33], PCA (principal component analysis) ,detection of polygonal wheels on freight vehicles using CWT and ARX features, using\n6 accelerometers, 3 on each side of the railway track. Mosleh et al. introduced aflats by extracting AR features from acceleration records. Moreover, Mohammadi et al.\nadopted linear features, particularly, CWT, PCA, ARX and AR, and their research findingsin the context of wheel flat damage detection. Although these studies have demonstrated robust results in detection, they show some limitations in dealing with the non-linear effects associated with operational effects, such as the train speed. Due to the inability of these linear techniques to attenuate operation effects, the inclusion of different speeds\nFor most of these studies, a feature normalisation stage is used when it is necessary to remove the operational effects. Usually, latent variable methods are used, such as PCA or multiple linear regression (MLR) . Thus, to deal with the non-linear phenomena and reduce the large amounts of data without relying on the aforementioned methods,\nthe first artificial neural networks were created to inherently execute this task . Over the years, new and more advanced networks have been developed, with the Autoencoder\n(AE) being one of the main types. Later, Olshausen et al. proposed the creation of\nsparse coding and Ng et al. introduced a sparse penalisation term in the hidden layer,\nto acquire more compact and effective features from lower-dimensional data. For some datasets with complex relationships between characteristics, employing more than one SAE\nis necessary, which is why stacked sparse autoencoders (SSAE) are commonly used .\nNowadays, these types of AE are widely used in various scientific fields, but specifically\nfor structural engineering only a few studies are found, and most are about damage detection on bridges [45–47].

Pathirage et al. proposed a framework utilizing SAE’s potential for dimensionality reduction, which facilitated the assessment of damage detection performance on Many of these AE algorithms already performed feature classification in order to discriminate the different types of damages and severities. However, the AE methods can also be combined with other techniques commonly used to classify the data. They can be used unsupervised methods, in which the model is trained without any labels provided to the\ntraining dataset, such as k-means , self-organising maps (SOM) , isolation forest, gaussian mixture model , k-medoids and cluster analysis , or supervised\nmethods, which assume that the hierarchy of database categories is known, such as NaiveBayes classifiers , k-Nearest Neighbours classifiers , Support Vector Machinetwo types of OOR damages, flats and polygonal wheels, based on acceleration responses obtained from a virtual wayside monitoring system.

The application of sensors on both sides of theTo obtain the responses from the railway track, it is necessary to apply sensors on the track that can measure the dynamic responses of the crossing trains. As it is not always possible\nto install them due to the high costs involved, simulations have been carried out based on calibrated models of the track , vehicle and considering their dynamic interaction,\nas well as including the track irregularities. Simulations include cases with healthy wheelsTo simulate the dynamic interactions between the vehicle and the track, an in-house software VSI – Vehicle-Structure Interaction Analysis is used, which was initially developed by\nNeves et al. and later improved by Montenegro et al. .

Including the track irregularities directly in the constraint equations are beneficial since it avoids explicitly considering\nthem in the FEM model. Moreover, it also allows to include the wheel and OOR profiles as a periodic rail irregularity, simplifying the analysis. Thus, before starting the analysis, the\nVSI software imports track irregularities and OOR profiles from a MATLAB file, whichto the vertical and lateral irregularities in each rail in each respective position, and adds it to the constraint equations of the system throughout the dynamics analysis. Then, the\nsystem of dynamic equations is solved using the typical Newmark integration method.\nThe impact of track irregularity on wheel defect classification is significant, as a lower track quality tends to result in a higher likelihood of misclassification. A comprehensive\nexploration of this influence was previously undertaken by Mosleh et al. as documented in their research study . Hence, this study does not delve into the impact of track\nquality; rather, it primarily centres on the utilisation of AI-based methodologies for the detection and classification of wheel defects. For this, four different profiles are used, based\non European Standard EN 13848–2 . In this case, power spectral density (PSD) curvesFor OOR defects, several profiles are defined based on real measurements in representative profiles of the various severities. Subsequently, the structural matrices are imported\nMore details on track and train properties, including additional information on traintrack interaction, can be found in previous publications . Figure 1 shows the\nvehicle–track interaction model schematisation and some details about the train and track\nsubsystems, as well as the track irregularities and wheel-rail contact model.According to the conclusions reached in other studies with this type of damage ,\nthe most promising location of the sensors is on the rail. To reduce installation and maintenance costs, it is important to reduce the number of sensors without compromising the\nquality of the results. Therefore, based on a sensitivity analysis performed during the study,\nonly two vertical unidirectional accelerometers were used on each rail, 4 in total (A1 to A4),\nsince they provided a higher cost–benefit ratio. These sensors are mounted on the rail atdefects, different simulation scenarios with perfect wheels (baseline) and OOR wheels\n(damage) were defined for a five-wagon Laagrss freight train. Based on different crossing speeds, loading schemes and rail irregularities profiles, 120 baseline and 180 damage scenarios (90 for polygonal wheels and 90 for wheel flats) were defined, as summarised in For baseline scenarios, six loading schemes with five different speeds (40, 60, 80, 100\nand 120 km/h) and four rail irregularity profiles were considered, giving a total of 120 scenarios. The loading schemes used are: empty, half-loaded, full-loaded and, additionally,For the damage cases, a total of 90 scenarios were generated for polygonal wheels. These\nscenarios including 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (H1, H2 and H3) x 10 different irregularity profiles within each specified harmonic interval. In these 10 irregularity\nprofiles, based on the defect amplitude, two amplitudes are considered, five simulations for\nA1 and five simulations for A2. Similarly, 90 scenarios were created for wheel flats, involving 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (F1, F2 and F3) x 10 different irregularitywheel radius . This wave phenomenon can be characterised by the different wavelengths formed (harmonics θ ), and by the levels of irregularity ( Lw ) associated with each of the harmonics. According to Peng , it is considered a polygonal wheel when the wear amplitude assumes values above 0. mm and wavelengths between 140 mm and the wheelTo define scenarios with polygonal wheels for the Laagrss wagon, a literature survey on\nexperimental measurements in defective wheels was conducted . Three experimental irregularity profiles were collected, illustrated in Figure 3. The first group (H6-8)\ncorresponds to a study carried out by Cai et al. with dominant harmonics from 6 to 8;**Figure 3.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) of polygonal wheels with**Figure 4.** Examples of polygonal damage profiles for each of the dominant harmonic intervals.the second group (H12-14) to a study authored by Tao et al. with dominant harmonics from 12 to 14; and the third profile (H17-18) to a study performed by Wu et al. with\nBased on the wheel irregularity spectra ( Lw ) taken from the respective measurement profiles, shown in Figure 3, and considering the contribution of the first 30 harmonics, several irregularity profiles were generated, according to Figure 4.

Then,predefined hyperparameters of the algorithm. The set hyperparameters are encoding and\ndecoding transfer functions, hidden layer size, maximum number of epochs, L2 weight regularisation term, sparsity regularisation term and a sparsity proportion term. Afterwards,**Figure 7.** Flowchart with the main phases of the methodology for detection and classification of OORthe features are extracted in the more compressed layer of the SAE, the so-called bottleneck layer. The number of features obtained is equal to the number of hidden layers which\nis usually considerably lower than the data size, allowing a compression of the input data.\nFurthermore, to enhance the sensitivity to damage, two levels of data fusion are applied to the bottleneck features using the Mahalanobis distance. In the first level, all features are\nfused into a damage index (DI) for each sensor and, in the second level, all the sensors\nare merged resulting in only one DI for each simulation. Finally, automatic damage detection is achieved by performing an outlier analysis, in which a statistical confidence limit\n(CB) is used, based on the Inverse Cumulative Gaussian Distribution Function (ICDF).\nFor feature classification, an automatic clustering process based on the k-means technique is implemented. This algorithm allows for the unsupervised and automatic classification of data, based on the calculation of statistical distances between objects. In k-means technique given a vector of data and chosen k clusters, the key is to find k centroids that minimise\nthe distance of each vector to its nearest centroid . Since it is necessary to define the number of clusters in advance, a global Silhouette index (SIL) was adopted to make\nan automatic process. At the end, the clusters will allow the classification of the two typesbetween the number of correct classifications and the total number of cases.damage detection problems, as it allows a signal to be converted from the time domain to the frequency domain, to capture the excitation frequencies induced by the wheel defects.\nIn addition, a data reduction is carried out at this stage, since the initial records contain aa crossing speed of 80 km/h. When comparing the FFT spectra for a train passage with flats, Figure 8a), with polygonal wheels, Figure 8b), there are visible differences in terms\nof amplitude peak values and excited frequency ranges. For flats, the amplitude peak values are higher and they induce frequencies in the range between DC and 1500accordance with some authors reports . In terms of severities, for flats, the more severe group (55–100 mm) is the one with the higher frequency content, as expected,a baseline response. For polygonal wheels, from the analysis of Figure 8b), it can be seen the frequency peaks for the H12–14 and H17–18 profiles around 100 and 150\nrespectively, while for the profile H6-8 a more flat spectrum is obtained without showing any significant peak. This can be explained by the irregularity level profile of thisThese two graphs can show which frequencies have higher content in the original signal.Autoencoders are artificial neural networks trained using an unsupervised approach,\nwhich aim first to learn coded representations of the data, compressing the input into\na latent space representation, and second, through this compressed information, reconstructing the information. The basic architecture of this type of network consists of threewhere **Wij**, **Wjk** are the weights connection matrices between input layer-hidden\nlayer and hidden layer-output layer, **X** = ( **X** 1, **X** 2, . . ., **Xn** ) is the input data vector,\n**H** = ( **H** 1, . . ., **Hm** ) is the low-dimensional vector and **X** [ˆ] = ( **X** [ˆ] 1, **X** [ˆ] 2, . . ., **X** [ˆ] **n** ) is the output**Figure 8.** Frequency domain responses on position 1 for the crossing speed of 80 km/h: (a) wheel flats,data vector. **b** 1, **b** 2 are bias vectors and σ 1, σ 2 are the activation function used in each of thereconstruction of the input X [ˆ], as shown in Equation (3).

After incorporating various inputs into the SSAE training, they are integrated into the so-called\n‘Input 1’. As training progresses, the data is compressed, and the main characteristics of the signals are obtained and retained in ‘Bottleneck 1’. Subsequently, these characteristics are\nused as input for training the second sparse autoencoder, which, after further compression,\nenables the extraction of the final features. Depending on the type of data under analysis,\nthe compression level differs, so multiple tests should be conducted to optimise these layer sizes. This optimisation was achieved by trial and test, changing both the size of the first\nIt should be noted that this network architecture, where the dimensions of the layers gradually decrease along the network until reaching the bottleneck layer , has proven\nto be highly robust for the type of data used. It allows for effective compression of results**Figure 9.** Schematic of the structure of the SSAE neural network used in this study.After extracting the features from the bottleneck layer of the SSAE, the difference between the healthy wheels scenarios and the damage wheels scenarios is still not sufficient. Hence\na data fusion is performed. With this fusion, it is possible to increase the sensitivity of the\nfeatures, and as a result, to obtain a damage index (DI) for each simulation. Thus, the Mahalanobis distance (MD) is used to reduce the volume of extracted data and preserve the most relevant information . Briefly, MD is a metric that measures the distance between two points in a feature space consisting of two or more variables, being independent of the\nscale of the features, thus allowing an increase in the sensitivity of the features to cases with damage. The MD, denoted here as DI, is calculated for each simulation using the followingin which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−], and ¯ x is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The MD is calculated for each sensor and for each simulation, obtaining a matrix of n distances per k number of sensors.Finally, the discrimination of the features consists in distinguishing the features as corresponding to a healthy or damaged case. At this stage of the methodology, an analysis of\nabnormal values is carried out, which will allow the condition of the train wheels to beautomatically monitored and these values to be classified into different classes. This phaseThe outlier analysis consists of grouping, by probabilistic distribution processes, the datato the previously created group. For this, a statistical confidence limit (CB) is used, based on the inverse cumulative Gaussian distribution function (ICDF), considering the mean\nvalue, ¯ μ, and standard deviation, σ, of the baseline feature vector.Whenever a value of a DI indicator is equal to or greater than CB, it is considered an outlier (the null hypothesis is rejected), thus representing a case of damage.For feature classification, a clustering process is used to divide the dataset into distinct clusters that should be as compact and separated as possible . For clustering, the k-meanson the distances of their vectors. Recent studies showed that the k-means algorithm has shown promising results . The main limitation of this technique is that it requires\nknowledge of the number of clusters in advance. For this purpose, the global silhouetteThis section presents the main results obtained through the application of the methodology proposed in section 3 to the calculated track responses. The methodology is applied using damaged wheel passages for the three simulated train speeds (60, 80 and 100 km/h),hyperparameters (presented in section 3). By adjusting these hyperparameters, it is possible to make the algorithm more efficient and improve the generalisation capabilities, as only\nthe most important features are retained. The optimisation of these hyperparameters isof data under analysis. Based on the principles of the SAE already outlined in other works\nIn the context of this study, the non-linear transfer functions (logsig) proved to be more effective than the linear ones, being the ones used in all the studied cases. After analysing Table 3, there is a similarity in the hyperparameters when comparing the two types of OOR damage. It is observed that the data compression level is the same for both cases, around\n93%, as 500 features are extracted in Bottleneck 2 from the initial input data with 7000\nConcerning the type of damage situation, the size of the ‘Bottleneck 1’ and ‘Bottleneck\n2’ was increased to bring them even closer to the initial amount of input data. This can beanalysis, making it challenging for the autoencoder to define relationships between the data, hence requiring a larger number. On the contrary, the maximum number of epochsIt is also important to emphasise that of the various hyperparameters presented, theOnce the hyperparameters have been defined, all the steps of the methodology are applied to the new dataset. For simplicity, in this section, only the last phase of the methodology will be presented, namely an outlier analysis for damage detection and cluster analysis for damage classification. For each sensor, a matrix n × m is created, where n\nis the number of test passages (baseline scenarios + damage scenarios), and m represents the number of extracted features. So, the size of the matrices is 210 × 2000 in case of the\ntype of damage, 75 × 500 for each amplitude in polygonal wheel, and 120 × 500 for wheelDespite the visual distinction between healthy and damaged wheels based on the data processing presented in subsection 3.2, unsupervised learning must use strategies capable of automatically detecting damage. To this end, an outlier analysis is employed, which consists of defining a confidence threshold using a significance level of 1% , represented**Figure 10.** Automatic OOR damage detection based on outlier analysis.by the green line in Figure 10. This approach makes it possible to successfully detect allTo distinguish the two types of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed. Figure 11\nshows a clear distinction between the damage, even when using a dataset with three different train speeds (60,80 and 100 km/h).. In the case of Figure 11a), using all four\naccelerometers, it is possible to efficiently separate the set into two large clusters, despite\n30 misclassifications (16 in the polygonisation and 14 in the flats). Even so, the accuracy\npercentage is around 85%, which is a very good result. To analyse the sensitivity to the number of sensors, only two sensors were used, one on each side ). The results\nimproved, with a decrease in the number of misclassifications from 30 to 21 (13 for polygonisation and 8 for flats). One explanation could be the disparity in sensor sensitivity to the damage, where some sensors are more sensitive than others due to their spatial positioning in relation to the damage. By merging the data from the less sensitive sensors with the\nmore sensitive ones, this could have a negative impact on the results. Thus, the percentage\nThe purpose behind presenting these two plots was to demonstrate that, whether using 4 sensors or 2 sensors, the classification remains remarkably robust, showing lowAfter identifying the type of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed once again to\nclassify the severity of each damage separately. Regarding polygonal wheels, the classification involves both amplitude and harmonic orders, leading to the clusters depicted in the obtained clusters reasonably reflect the two amplitude groups, with all misclassifications associated with the H6-8 harmonic cases (17 misclassifications). Once the amplitude\nis identified, harmonic classification must be carried out separately for each of the amplitudes. In Figure 12b), related to amplitude A1, it is observed that the obtained clusters**Figure 11.** Automatic OOR damage classification based on cluster analysis using: a) 4 sensors; b) 2are nearly perfect, with only 3 misclassifications. In Figure 12c), there are only 3 misclassifications, totalling 8 misclassifications in the classification of the number of dominant\nThe classification of harmonic order is only possible with the separation of amplitudes,\nFigure 13 presents the clusters obtained for the wheel flat cases. The separation between\nthe less severe group and baseline cases and intermediate (cluster 3) and severe cases (cluster 4) is reduced, resulting in a total of 19 misclassifications. Nevertheless, this result showsrate of about 84%. One possible reason for this significant number of misclassifications could be directly associated with the number of impacts captured by the sensor.In order to contribute to the safety of railway transportation and service quality, an automatic methodology based on machine learning has been proposed. This methodology can accurately detect and classify two types of OOR wheel damage in railway vehicles allowing to mitigate problems at both track and vehicle level, such as derailments or material\ndegradation. It includes a new technique for feature extraction based on a dedicated neural network, the Sparse Autoencoder. This non-linear technique is an upgrade concerning the commonly used linear techniques for feature extraction since it allows a better normalisation of the operational effects in the analysed data, as well as the reduction of large amounts\nof data without relying on other techniques, while keeping the most valuable information. These improvements are achieved through the use of different hyperparameters in**Figure 12.** Automatic classification of polygonal wheels based on cluster analysis: a) amplitude A1-A2;**Figure 13.** Automatic classification of wheel flats based on cluster analysis.the calculations, such as non-linear activation functions and sparsity terms. Consequently,circulation. Particularly in the railway engineering field, the inclusion of this technique\nshowed a good potential to deal with variable train speeds, essentially due to the amplifying effect on the measured track dynamic responses which could induce errors in damage The application of the methodology to the data set proved to be very successful in detecting and classifying the two types of OOR damages. Damage detection was perfect, without\nany false detection. In terms of classifying the type of damage, the results are very good,\nwith a success rate of around 85%, but if only two accelerometers are considered the successrate increases to around 90%. These results are encouraging since the range of speeds considered in the analysis, between 60 and 100 km/h, is the most representative of in-service\nfreight trains. Also, the results show that including the Sparse Autoencoder has a positive\neffect in the normalization of the train speed in the damage data set.\nRegarding the severity classification for each type of damage, the methodology proved equally successful in clustering the different damage severities. For polygonal wheels, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the severity groups in terms of defect amplitude, failing only for the H6-8 harmonic cases, and in terms of harmonic orders for each amplitude,\nwith almost perfect results. For wheel flats, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the three severity groups, though with some misclassifications between the less severe group\nand baseline cases and between intermediate and severe cases. A success rate of around 86%\nis achieved in the classification of polygonal wheel severities and 84% in the classification of wheel flat severities. Even so, these high success rates of over 80% show the robustness\nof this methodology in damage classification regardless of the train speed.on on-site measurements. Additionally, this methodology could be carried out for other types of railway vehicles, for example, passenger vehicles, since the dynamic responses are\ndifferent from freight vehicles. In that case, exploring other recent types of autoencoders,\nTo increase the complexity of the problem, the objective is to explore the concept of\nmultiple damages (same or different OOR types). For this, it will be necessary to incorporate a new stage in the methodology, the damage location stage, which will make it possible\nto distinguish isolated damage from multiple damage, as well as their respective location.\nThus, damage will be identified using cut signals, which will then be used to classify theThis work is a result of project WAY4SafeRail-WAYside monitoring system FOR SAFE RAIL transportation, with reference NORTE-01-0247-FEDER-069595, co-funded by the European Regional\nDevelopment Fund (ERDF), through the North Portugal Regional Operational Programme\nPartnership Agreement.

Within this context,\nan unsupervised methodology based on artificial intelligence techniques is presented, which allows the detection and classification of wheels, based on dynamic responses induced on the track by crossing freight railway vehicles. The methodology involves the following\nsteps: (i) data collection and pre-processing, (ii) feature extraction (iii)\ndata fusion and (iv) feature discrimination. In the first phase, an FFT\nalgorithm is applied to the acceleration track responses. Then, features are extracted after training a Stacked Sparse Autoencoder, in which the main features of the responses are obtained after a compression stage using an encoder network. This lower dimensional\nlayer forces the model to learn a compression of the input data. Then,\nwhich enhances the sensitivity to the damage recognition. Posteriorly, an outlier analysis is performed to distinguish a healthy wheelRail vehicle wheels are subjected to constant wear and tear due to continuous use and inadequate maintenance plans. Over time, this wear and tear can generate more significant defects, so it is extremely important to use sensing to understand when maintenance of both the track and rolling stock is required. Over the last few decades, researchers havewayside systems, being the main difference in the location of the measuring devices. MostThe Author(s).

However, this type of system entail high costs envisaging the vehicle wheel condition monitoring, since sensors need to be installed in every vehicle in order to achieve a good representativity . On the other hand, wayside systems are a more viable solution for identifying wheel defects, since the condition of allThe most common wheel defects are known as OOR. As the name infers, this defect is related to deformations on the surface of the wheel circumference that make it not round.\nThis deformation can have many forms and different causes, leading to faults on the vehicle and on the track due to the higher dynamic force values [4–6]. The OOR damagesa function of their shape and size, vehicle characteristics and speed [7–10]. Wheel flats induce high dynamic impact loads on the railway infrastructure, which causes significant damage to both tracks and vehicles, such as broken axles, damaged rolling bearings and cracks in the wheels, rails and sleepers . Moreover, it also generates high vibrations\ntransmitted to the rolling stock, inducing significant stresses and causing damage to the In the case of polygonal wheels, the formation mechanism can be roughly classified\ninto three categories, namely, (1) initial wheel defects , (2) a natural vibration of the\nvehicle–track system and (3) thermoelastic instability . The formation mechanism is strongly contingent on the vehicle type and its operational characteristics, withof dominant harmonic orders [19–22]. For example, Tao et al. studied asymmetrical polygonal wear on metro wheels and obtained harmonic orders of 12–14, while another study by Tao et al. found that the most common harmonic order in Chinese freight trains is 18–19. Although a polygonal wheel could generate less impact on the track than a\nwheel flat, this defect can cause serious damage to the track due to resonance effects in the\nTo identify the occurrence of these OOR anomalies in train wheels, innovative\nmethodologies have been developed combining signal processing and automatic learning techniques. These methodologies are based on the extraction of damage sensitivity features, making possible the distinction between undamaged and damaged situations. Recently, many studies have shown good results in detecting OOR damages using\ndistinct approaches [24–29]. Mishra et al. concluded that a single FBG (Fiber Bragg Grating) sensor, positioned along the rail can detect the presence of wheel flats.\nLourenço et al. created an automatic algorithm for diagnosing OOR defects. The\nproposed methodology consists of isolating specific defective wheels and then identifying the severity of the damage, using only acceleration and strain data measured on\nthe track. In another study, Krummenacher et al. , proposed two machine-learningBy extracting the features, it is possible to transform the measured data into an alternative form of information where the correlation with damage is more easily observed. There are various techniques for feature extraction, the most common being CWT\n(continuous wavelet transform) [31–33], PCA (principal component analysis) ,detection of polygonal wheels on freight vehicles using CWT and ARX features, using\n6 accelerometers, 3 on each side of the railway track. Mosleh et al. introduced aflats by extracting AR features from acceleration records. Moreover, Mohammadi et al.\nadopted linear features, particularly, CWT, PCA, ARX and AR, and their research findingsin the context of wheel flat damage detection. Although these studies have demonstrated robust results in detection, they show some limitations in dealing with the non-linear effects associated with operational effects, such as the train speed. Due to the inability of these linear techniques to attenuate operation effects, the inclusion of different speeds\nFor most of these studies, a feature normalisation stage is used when it is necessary to remove the operational effects. Usually, latent variable methods are used, such as PCA or multiple linear regression (MLR) . Thus, to deal with the non-linear phenomena and reduce the large amounts of data without relying on the aforementioned methods,\nthe first artificial neural networks were created to inherently execute this task . Over the years, new and more advanced networks have been developed, with the Autoencoder\n(AE) being one of the main types. Later, Olshausen et al. proposed the creation of\nsparse coding and Ng et al. introduced a sparse penalisation term in the hidden layer,\nto acquire more compact and effective features from lower-dimensional data. For some datasets with complex relationships between characteristics, employing more than one SAE\nis necessary, which is why stacked sparse autoencoders (SSAE) are commonly used .\nNowadays, these types of AE are widely used in various scientific fields, but specifically\nfor structural engineering only a few studies are found, and most are about damage detection on bridges [45–47]. Amaral et al. , proposed an approach for detecting structural anomalies based on SAE and Shewhart’s T control chart. The characteristics extracted byin structures. In another similar study, Amaral et al. , applied the same approach to\na numerical model of a highway viaduct in Brazil reaching more than 99% of successful classifications of structural damage with the combination of SAE and Support Vector Machine. Pathirage et al. proposed a framework utilizing SAE’s potential for dimensionality reduction, which facilitated the assessment of damage detection performance on Many of these AE algorithms already performed feature classification in order to discriminate the different types of damages and severities. However, the AE methods can also be combined with other techniques commonly used to classify the data. They can be used unsupervised methods, in which the model is trained without any labels provided to the\ntraining dataset, such as k-means , self-organising maps (SOM) , isolation forest, gaussian mixture model , k-medoids and cluster analysis , or supervised\nmethods, which assume that the hierarchy of database categories is known, such as NaiveBayes classifiers , k-Nearest Neighbours classifiers , Support Vector Machinetwo types of OOR damages, flats and polygonal wheels, based on acceleration responses obtained from a virtual wayside monitoring system. The methodology comprises seven\nstages: (i) data collection, (ii) data pre-processing, (iii) training on a Stacked Sparse Autoencoder, (iv) feature extraction, (v) data fusion, (vi) outlier analysis and (vii) cluster analysis.\nThus, this numerical study aims to make innovative contributions to the current state of- Use of a Autoencoder neural network for feature extraction.

The application of sensors on both sides of theTo obtain the responses from the railway track, it is necessary to apply sensors on the track that can measure the dynamic responses of the crossing trains. As it is not always possible\nto install them due to the high costs involved, simulations have been carried out based on calibrated models of the track , vehicle and considering their dynamic interaction,\nas well as including the track irregularities. Simulations include cases with healthy wheelsTo simulate the dynamic interactions between the vehicle and the track, an in-house software VSI – Vehicle-Structure Interaction Analysis is used, which was initially developed by\nNeves et al. and later improved by Montenegro et al. .

The vehicle model integrates spring elements to simulate suspensions, mass elements to represent the mass and\ninertia at the centre of gravity of the wagon components. For the structural connection of these elements, rigid beam elements are adopted. Table 1 outlines the properties of the The Hertzian theory is applied to calculate the normal contact forces, while the USETABthe train to the track in the VSI software. Using Lagrange multipliers, this tool connects\nwheel displacements with the track nodal displacements, incorporating track irregularities and OOR profiles through a set of constraint equations. These equations are solved\nalongside equilibrium equations, forming a unified system that couples the two subsystems\n. Including the track irregularities directly in the constraint equations are beneficial since it avoids explicitly considering\nthem in the FEM model. Moreover, it also allows to include the wheel and OOR profiles as a periodic rail irregularity, simplifying the analysis. Thus, before starting the analysis, the\nVSI software imports track irregularities and OOR profiles from a MATLAB file, whichto the vertical and lateral irregularities in each rail in each respective position, and adds it to the constraint equations of the system throughout the dynamics analysis. Then, the\nsystem of dynamic equations is solved using the typical Newmark integration method.\nThe impact of track irregularity on wheel defect classification is significant, as a lower track quality tends to result in a higher likelihood of misclassification. A comprehensive\nexploration of this influence was previously undertaken by Mosleh et al. as documented in their research study . Hence, this study does not delve into the impact of track\nquality; rather, it primarily centres on the utilisation of AI-based methodologies for the detection and classification of wheel defects. For this, four different profiles are used, based\non European Standard EN 13848–2 . In this case, power spectral density (PSD) curvesFor OOR defects, several profiles are defined based on real measurements in representative profiles of the various severities. Subsequently, the structural matrices are imported\nMore details on track and train properties, including additional information on traintrack interaction, can be found in previous publications . Figure 1 shows the\nvehicle–track interaction model schematisation and some details about the train and track\nsubsystems, as well as the track irregularities and wheel-rail contact model.According to the conclusions reached in other studies with this type of damage ,\nthe most promising location of the sensors is on the rail. To reduce installation and maintenance costs, it is important to reduce the number of sensors without compromising the\nquality of the results. Therefore, based on a sensitivity analysis performed during the study,\nonly two vertical unidirectional accelerometers were used on each rail, 4 in total (A1 to A4),\nsince they provided a higher cost–benefit ratio. These sensors are mounted on the rail atdefects, different simulation scenarios with perfect wheels (baseline) and OOR wheels\n(damage) were defined for a five-wagon Laagrss freight train. Based on different crossing speeds, loading schemes and rail irregularities profiles, 120 baseline and 180 damage scenarios (90 for polygonal wheels and 90 for wheel flats) were defined, as summarised in For baseline scenarios, six loading schemes with five different speeds (40, 60, 80, 100\nand 120 km/h) and four rail irregularity profiles were considered, giving a total of 120 scenarios. The loading schemes used are: empty, half-loaded, full-loaded and, additionally,For the damage cases, a total of 90 scenarios were generated for polygonal wheels. These\nscenarios including 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (H1, H2 and H3) x 10 different irregularity profiles within each specified harmonic interval. In these 10 irregularity\nprofiles, based on the defect amplitude, two amplitudes are considered, five simulations for\nA1 and five simulations for A2. Similarly, 90 scenarios were created for wheel flats, involving 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (F1, F2 and F3) x 10 different irregularitywheel radius . This wave phenomenon can be characterised by the different wavelengths formed (harmonics θ ), and by the levels of irregularity ( Lw ) associated with each of the harmonics. According to Peng , it is considered a polygonal wheel when the wear amplitude assumes values above 0. mm and wavelengths between 140 mm and the wheelTo define scenarios with polygonal wheels for the Laagrss wagon, a literature survey on\nexperimental measurements in defective wheels was conducted . Three experimental irregularity profiles were collected, illustrated in Figure 3. The first group (H6-8)\ncorresponds to a study carried out by Cai et al. with dominant harmonics from 6 to 8;**Figure 3.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) of polygonal wheels with**Figure 4.** Examples of polygonal damage profiles for each of the dominant harmonic intervals.the second group (H12-14) to a study authored by Tao et al. with dominant harmonics from 12 to 14; and the third profile (H17-18) to a study performed by Wu et al. with\nBased on the wheel irregularity spectra ( Lw ) taken from the respective measurement profiles, shown in Figure 3, and considering the contribution of the first 30 harmonics, several irregularity profiles were generated, according to Figure 4.

A less severe group, with a 10–20 mm length, an intermediate group, with a 25–50 mm length and a more severe case, with a 55–100 mm length. The irregularity profiles are generated randomly, but in this case, in function of two geometric\nvariables, the length and the depth of the flat. More details about the process of generation of flat profiles can be found in the study performed by Mosleh et al .

The sampling frequency for data acquisition is considered 10 kHz in order to ensure a good problem Figure 6a) shows two baseline cases for two speeds (40 and 100 km/h), where it is possible to observe the influence of speed on the dynamic response. The amplifying effect\nof speed can influence the identification of damage, which is why a robust baseline with a wide range of scenarios is very important. At a speed of 40 km/h, lower accelerations\naround 0. m/s⊃2 are observed. In contrast, at a speed of 100 km/h (considerably higher),\naccelerations increase substantially to around 3. m/s⊃2. This illustrates the significant**Figure 6.** Acceleration time-series in sensor A1 for Laagrss vehicle: (a) influence of speed, (b) influencehigher speeds.

After obtaining the acceleration measurements from the numerical simulations, an FFT algorithm is applied to the time series allowing the conversion of the signal from the time domain to the frequency domain. Then,predefined hyperparameters of the algorithm. The set hyperparameters are encoding and\ndecoding transfer functions, hidden layer size, maximum number of epochs, L2 weight regularisation term, sparsity regularisation term and a sparsity proportion term. Afterwards,**Figure 7.** Flowchart with the main phases of the methodology for detection and classification of OORthe features are extracted in the more compressed layer of the SAE, the so-called bottleneck layer. The number of features obtained is equal to the number of hidden layers which\nis usually considerably lower than the data size, allowing a compression of the input data.\nFurthermore, to enhance the sensitivity to damage, two levels of data fusion are applied to the bottleneck features using the Mahalanobis distance. In the first level, all features are\nfused into a damage index (DI) for each sensor and, in the second level, all the sensors\nare merged resulting in only one DI for each simulation. Finally, automatic damage detection is achieved by performing an outlier analysis, in which a statistical confidence limit\n(CB) is used, based on the Inverse Cumulative Gaussian Distribution Function (ICDF).\nFor feature classification, an automatic clustering process based on the k-means technique is implemented. This algorithm allows for the unsupervised and automatic classification of data, based on the calculation of statistical distances between objects. In k-means technique given a vector of data and chosen k clusters, the key is to find k centroids that minimise\nthe distance of each vector to its nearest centroid . Since it is necessary to define the number of clusters in advance, a global Silhouette index (SIL) was adopted to make\nan automatic process. At the end, the clusters will allow the classification of the two typesbetween the number of correct classifications and the total number of cases.damage detection problems, as it allows a signal to be converted from the time domain to the frequency domain, to capture the excitation frequencies induced by the wheel defects.\nIn addition, a data reduction is carried out at this stage, since the initial records contain aa crossing speed of 80 km/h. When comparing the FFT spectra for a train passage with flats, Figure 8a), with polygonal wheels, Figure 8b), there are visible differences in terms\nof amplitude peak values and excited frequency ranges. For flats, the amplitude peak values are higher and they induce frequencies in the range between DC and 1500accordance with some authors reports . In terms of severities, for flats, the more severe group (55–100 mm) is the one with the higher frequency content, as expected,a baseline response. For polygonal wheels, from the analysis of Figure 8b), it can be seen the frequency peaks for the H12–14 and H17–18 profiles around 100 and 150\nrespectively, while for the profile H6-8 a more flat spectrum is obtained without showing any significant peak. This can be explained by the irregularity level profile of thisThese two graphs can show which frequencies have higher content in the original signal.Autoencoders are artificial neural networks trained using an unsupervised approach,\nwhich aim first to learn coded representations of the data, compressing the input into\na latent space representation, and second, through this compressed information, reconstructing the information. The basic architecture of this type of network consists of threewhere **Wij**, **Wjk** are the weights connection matrices between input layer-hidden\nlayer and hidden layer-output layer, **X** = ( **X** 1, **X** 2, . . ., **Xn** ) is the input data vector,\n**H** = ( **H** 1, . . ., **Hm** ) is the low-dimensional vector and **X** [ˆ] = ( **X** [ˆ] 1, **X** [ˆ] 2, . . ., **X** [ˆ] **n** ) is the output**Figure 8.** Frequency domain responses on position 1 for the crossing speed of 80 km/h: (a) wheel flats,data vector. **b** 1, **b** 2 are bias vectors and σ 1, σ 2 are the activation function used in each of thereconstruction of the input X [ˆ], as shown in Equation (3). This function uses the meanIn the Sparse Autoencoder, to make the coding more efficient, two regularisation terms,\nsparse penalty term and weight regularisation term, are added to the error function, causing only a subset of neurons to be activated. The average activation of neurons in the hiddenAs the average activation ˆ ρ is intended to be close to a constant ρ (sparsity proportion)\nand it is usually a small positive number near 0, the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence isIn addition to this, a weight regularisation term, called L2 regularisation, is also addedwhere L is the number of hidden layers, nl the output size of layer l, kl the input size ofwhere μ is the coefficient for the L2 regularisation term and β the coefficient for the sparsityAfter data pre-processing, the acceleration responses in the frequency domain, are then In this work, two layers of SAE’s were used to form the network, as shown in Figure 9.layers, with the outputs of the previous autoencoder serving as input for the next one. After incorporating various inputs into the SSAE training, they are integrated into the so-called\n‘Input 1’. As training progresses, the data is compressed, and the main characteristics of the signals are obtained and retained in ‘Bottleneck 1’. Subsequently, these characteristics are\nused as input for training the second sparse autoencoder, which, after further compression,\nenables the extraction of the final features. Depending on the type of data under analysis,\nthe compression level differs, so multiple tests should be conducted to optimise these layer sizes. This optimisation was achieved by trial and test, changing both the size of the first\nIt should be noted that this network architecture, where the dimensions of the layers gradually decrease along the network until reaching the bottleneck layer , has proven\nto be highly robust for the type of data used. It allows for effective compression of results**Figure 9.** Schematic of the structure of the SSAE neural network used in this study.After extracting the features from the bottleneck layer of the SSAE, the difference between the healthy wheels scenarios and the damage wheels scenarios is still not sufficient. Hence\na data fusion is performed. With this fusion, it is possible to increase the sensitivity of the\nfeatures, and as a result, to obtain a damage index (DI) for each simulation. Thus, the Mahalanobis distance (MD) is used to reduce the volume of extracted data and preserve the most relevant information . Briefly, MD is a metric that measures the distance between two points in a feature space consisting of two or more variables, being independent of the\nscale of the features, thus allowing an increase in the sensitivity of the features to cases with damage. The MD, denoted here as DI, is calculated for each simulation using the followingin which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−], and ¯ x is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The MD is calculated for each sensor and for each simulation, obtaining a matrix of n distances per k number of sensors.Finally, the discrimination of the features consists in distinguishing the features as corresponding to a healthy or damaged case. At this stage of the methodology, an analysis of\nabnormal values is carried out, which will allow the condition of the train wheels to beautomatically monitored and these values to be classified into different classes. This phaseThe outlier analysis consists of grouping, by probabilistic distribution processes, the datato the previously created group. For this, a statistical confidence limit (CB) is used, based on the inverse cumulative Gaussian distribution function (ICDF), considering the mean\nvalue, ¯ μ, and standard deviation, σ, of the baseline feature vector.Whenever a value of a DI indicator is equal to or greater than CB, it is considered an outlier (the null hypothesis is rejected), thus representing a case of damage.For feature classification, a clustering process is used to divide the dataset into distinct clusters that should be as compact and separated as possible . For clustering, the k-meanson the distances of their vectors. Recent studies showed that the k-means algorithm has shown promising results . The main limitation of this technique is that it requires\nknowledge of the number of clusters in advance. For this purpose, the global silhouetteThis section presents the main results obtained through the application of the methodology proposed in section 3 to the calculated track responses. The methodology is applied using damaged wheel passages for the three simulated train speeds (60, 80 and 100 km/h),hyperparameters (presented in section 3). By adjusting these hyperparameters, it is possible to make the algorithm more efficient and improve the generalisation capabilities, as only\nthe most important features are retained. The optimisation of these hyperparameters isof data under analysis. Based on the principles of the SAE already outlined in other works\nIn the context of this study, the non-linear transfer functions (logsig) proved to be more effective than the linear ones, being the ones used in all the studied cases. After analysing Table 3, there is a similarity in the hyperparameters when comparing the two types of OOR damage. It is observed that the data compression level is the same for both cases, around\n93%, as 500 features are extracted in Bottleneck 2 from the initial input data with 7000\nConcerning the type of damage situation, the size of the ‘Bottleneck 1’ and ‘Bottleneck\n2’ was increased to bring them even closer to the initial amount of input data. This can beanalysis, making it challenging for the autoencoder to define relationships between the data, hence requiring a larger number. On the contrary, the maximum number of epochsIt is also important to emphasise that of the various hyperparameters presented, theOnce the hyperparameters have been defined, all the steps of the methodology are applied to the new dataset. For simplicity, in this section, only the last phase of the methodology will be presented, namely an outlier analysis for damage detection and cluster analysis for damage classification. For each sensor, a matrix n × m is created, where n\nis the number of test passages (baseline scenarios + damage scenarios), and m represents the number of extracted features. So, the size of the matrices is 210 × 2000 in case of the\ntype of damage, 75 × 500 for each amplitude in polygonal wheel, and 120 × 500 for wheelDespite the visual distinction between healthy and damaged wheels based on the data processing presented in subsection 3.2, unsupervised learning must use strategies capable of automatically detecting damage. To this end, an outlier analysis is employed, which consists of defining a confidence threshold using a significance level of 1% , represented**Figure 10.** Automatic OOR damage detection based on outlier analysis.by the green line in Figure 10. This approach makes it possible to successfully detect allTo distinguish the two types of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed. Figure 11\nshows a clear distinction between the damage, even when using a dataset with three different train speeds (60,80 and 100 km/h).. In the case of Figure 11a), using all four\naccelerometers, it is possible to efficiently separate the set into two large clusters, despite\n30 misclassifications (16 in the polygonisation and 14 in the flats). Even so, the accuracy\npercentage is around 85%, which is a very good result. To analyse the sensitivity to the number of sensors, only two sensors were used, one on each side ). The results\nimproved, with a decrease in the number of misclassifications from 30 to 21 (13 for polygonisation and 8 for flats). One explanation could be the disparity in sensor sensitivity to the damage, where some sensors are more sensitive than others due to their spatial positioning in relation to the damage. By merging the data from the less sensitive sensors with the\nmore sensitive ones, this could have a negative impact on the results. Thus, the percentage\nThe purpose behind presenting these two plots was to demonstrate that, whether using 4 sensors or 2 sensors, the classification remains remarkably robust, showing lowAfter identifying the type of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed once again to\nclassify the severity of each damage separately. Regarding polygonal wheels, the classification involves both amplitude and harmonic orders, leading to the clusters depicted in the obtained clusters reasonably reflect the two amplitude groups, with all misclassifications associated with the H6-8 harmonic cases (17 misclassifications). Once the amplitude\nis identified, harmonic classification must be carried out separately for each of the amplitudes. In Figure 12b), related to amplitude A1, it is observed that the obtained clusters**Figure 11.** Automatic OOR damage classification based on cluster analysis using: a) 4 sensors; b) 2are nearly perfect, with only 3 misclassifications. In Figure 12c), there are only 3 misclassifications, totalling 8 misclassifications in the classification of the number of dominant\nThe classification of harmonic order is only possible with the separation of amplitudes,\nFigure 13 presents the clusters obtained for the wheel flat cases. The separation between\nthe less severe group and baseline cases and intermediate (cluster 3) and severe cases (cluster 4) is reduced, resulting in a total of 19 misclassifications. Nevertheless, this result showsrate of about 84%. One possible reason for this significant number of misclassifications could be directly associated with the number of impacts captured by the sensor.In order to contribute to the safety of railway transportation and service quality, an automatic methodology based on machine learning has been proposed. This methodology can accurately detect and classify two types of OOR wheel damage in railway vehicles allowing to mitigate problems at both track and vehicle level, such as derailments or material\ndegradation. It includes a new technique for feature extraction based on a dedicated neural network, the Sparse Autoencoder. This non-linear technique is an upgrade concerning the commonly used linear techniques for feature extraction since it allows a better normalisation of the operational effects in the analysed data, as well as the reduction of large amounts\nof data without relying on other techniques, while keeping the most valuable information. These improvements are achieved through the use of different hyperparameters in**Figure 12.** Automatic classification of polygonal wheels based on cluster analysis: a) amplitude A1-A2;**Figure 13.** Automatic classification of wheel flats based on cluster analysis.the calculations, such as non-linear activation functions and sparsity terms. Consequently,circulation. Particularly in the railway engineering field, the inclusion of this technique\nshowed a good potential to deal with variable train speeds, essentially due to the amplifying effect on the measured track dynamic responses which could induce errors in damage The application of the methodology to the data set proved to be very successful in detecting and classifying the two types of OOR damages. Damage detection was perfect, without\nany false detection. In terms of classifying the type of damage, the results are very good,\nwith a success rate of around 85%, but if only two accelerometers are considered the successrate increases to around 90%. These results are encouraging since the range of speeds considered in the analysis, between 60 and 100 km/h, is the most representative of in-service\nfreight trains. Also, the results show that including the Sparse Autoencoder has a positive\neffect in the normalization of the train speed in the damage data set.\nRegarding the severity classification for each type of damage, the methodology proved equally successful in clustering the different damage severities. For polygonal wheels, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the severity groups in terms of defect amplitude, failing only for the H6-8 harmonic cases, and in terms of harmonic orders for each amplitude,\nwith almost perfect results. For wheel flats, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the three severity groups, though with some misclassifications between the less severe group\nand baseline cases and between intermediate and severe cases. A success rate of around 86%\nis achieved in the classification of polygonal wheel severities and 84% in the classification of wheel flat severities. Even so, these high success rates of over 80% show the robustness\nof this methodology in damage classification regardless of the train speed.on on-site measurements. Additionally, this methodology could be carried out for other types of railway vehicles, for example, passenger vehicles, since the dynamic responses are\ndifferent from freight vehicles. In that case, exploring other recent types of autoencoders,\nTo increase the complexity of the problem, the objective is to explore the concept of\nmultiple damages (same or different OOR types). For this, it will be necessary to incorporate a new stage in the methodology, the damage location stage, which will make it possible\nto distinguish isolated damage from multiple damage, as well as their respective location.\nThus, damage will be identified using cut signals, which will then be used to classify theThis work is a result of project WAY4SafeRail-WAYside monitoring system FOR SAFE RAIL transportation, with reference NORTE-01-0247-FEDER-069595, co-funded by the European Regional\nDevelopment Fund (ERDF), through the North Portugal Regional Operational Programme\nPartnership Agreement.

Within this context,\nan unsupervised methodology based on artificial intelligence techniques is presented, which allows the detection and classification of wheels, based on dynamic responses induced on the track by crossing freight railway vehicles. The methodology involves the following\nsteps: (i) data collection and pre-processing, (ii) feature extraction (iii)\ndata fusion and (iv) feature discrimination. In the first phase, an FFT\nalgorithm is applied to the acceleration track responses. Then, features are extracted after training a Stacked Sparse Autoencoder, in which the main features of the responses are obtained after a compression stage using an encoder network. This lower dimensional\nlayer forces the model to learn a compression of the input data. Then,\nwhich enhances the sensitivity to the damage recognition. Posteriorly, an outlier analysis is performed to distinguish a healthy wheelRail vehicle wheels are subjected to constant wear and tear due to continuous use and inadequate maintenance plans. Over time, this wear and tear can generate more significant defects, so it is extremely important to use sensing to understand when maintenance of both the track and rolling stock is required.

However, this type of system entail high costs envisaging the vehicle wheel condition monitoring, since sensors need to be installed in every vehicle in order to achieve a good representativity . On the other hand, wayside systems are a more viable solution for identifying wheel defects, since the condition of allThe most common wheel defects are known as OOR. As the name infers, this defect is related to deformations on the surface of the wheel circumference that make it not round.\nThis deformation can have many forms and different causes, leading to faults on the vehicle and on the track due to the higher dynamic force values [4–6]. The OOR damagesa function of their shape and size, vehicle characteristics and speed [7–10]. Wheel flats induce high dynamic impact loads on the railway infrastructure, which causes significant damage to both tracks and vehicles, such as broken axles, damaged rolling bearings and cracks in the wheels, rails and sleepers . Moreover, it also generates high vibrations\ntransmitted to the rolling stock, inducing significant stresses and causing damage to the In the case of polygonal wheels, the formation mechanism can be roughly classified\ninto three categories, namely, (1) initial wheel defects , (2) a natural vibration of the\nvehicle–track system and (3) thermoelastic instability . The formation mechanism is strongly contingent on the vehicle type and its operational characteristics, withof dominant harmonic orders [19–22]. For example, Tao et al. studied asymmetrical polygonal wear on metro wheels and obtained harmonic orders of 12–14, while another study by Tao et al. found that the most common harmonic order in Chinese freight trains is 18–19. Although a polygonal wheel could generate less impact on the track than a\nwheel flat, this defect can cause serious damage to the track due to resonance effects in the\nTo identify the occurrence of these OOR anomalies in train wheels, innovative\nmethodologies have been developed combining signal processing and automatic learning techniques. These methodologies are based on the extraction of damage sensitivity features, making possible the distinction between undamaged and damaged situations. Recently, many studies have shown good results in detecting OOR damages using\ndistinct approaches [24–29]. Mishra et al. concluded that a single FBG (Fiber Bragg Grating) sensor, positioned along the rail can detect the presence of wheel flats.\nLourenço et al. created an automatic algorithm for diagnosing OOR defects. The\nproposed methodology consists of isolating specific defective wheels and then identifying the severity of the damage, using only acceleration and strain data measured on\nthe track. In another study, Krummenacher et al. , proposed two machine-learningBy extracting the features, it is possible to transform the measured data into an alternative form of information where the correlation with damage is more easily observed. There are various techniques for feature extraction, the most common being CWT\n(continuous wavelet transform) [31–33], PCA (principal component analysis) ,detection of polygonal wheels on freight vehicles using CWT and ARX features, using\n6 accelerometers, 3 on each side of the railway track. Mosleh et al. introduced aflats by extracting AR features from acceleration records. Moreover, Mohammadi et al.\nadopted linear features, particularly, CWT, PCA, ARX and AR, and their research findingsin the context of wheel flat damage detection. Although these studies have demonstrated robust results in detection, they show some limitations in dealing with the non-linear effects associated with operational effects, such as the train speed. Due to the inability of these linear techniques to attenuate operation effects, the inclusion of different speeds\nFor most of these studies, a feature normalisation stage is used when it is necessary to remove the operational effects. Usually, latent variable methods are used, such as PCA or multiple linear regression (MLR) . Thus, to deal with the non-linear phenomena and reduce the large amounts of data without relying on the aforementioned methods,\nthe first artificial neural networks were created to inherently execute this task . Over the years, new and more advanced networks have been developed, with the Autoencoder\n(AE) being one of the main types. Later, Olshausen et al. proposed the creation of\nsparse coding and Ng et al. introduced a sparse penalisation term in the hidden layer,\nto acquire more compact and effective features from lower-dimensional data. For some datasets with complex relationships between characteristics, employing more than one SAE\nis necessary, which is why stacked sparse autoencoders (SSAE) are commonly used .\nNowadays, these types of AE are widely used in various scientific fields, but specifically\nfor structural engineering only a few studies are found, and most are about damage detection on bridges [45–47].

Pathirage et al. proposed a framework utilizing SAE’s potential for dimensionality reduction, which facilitated the assessment of damage detection performance on Many of these AE algorithms already performed feature classification in order to discriminate the different types of damages and severities. However, the AE methods can also be combined with other techniques commonly used to classify the data. They can be used unsupervised methods, in which the model is trained without any labels provided to the\ntraining dataset, such as k-means , self-organising maps (SOM) , isolation forest, gaussian mixture model , k-medoids and cluster analysis , or supervised\nmethods, which assume that the hierarchy of database categories is known, such as NaiveBayes classifiers , k-Nearest Neighbours classifiers , Support Vector Machinetwo types of OOR damages, flats and polygonal wheels, based on acceleration responses obtained from a virtual wayside monitoring system.

The application of sensors on both sides of theTo obtain the responses from the railway track, it is necessary to apply sensors on the track that can measure the dynamic responses of the crossing trains. As it is not always possible\nto install them due to the high costs involved, simulations have been carried out based on calibrated models of the track , vehicle and considering their dynamic interaction,\nas well as including the track irregularities.

Including the track irregularities directly in the constraint equations are beneficial since it avoids explicitly considering\nthem in the FEM model. Moreover, it also allows to include the wheel and OOR profiles as a periodic rail irregularity, simplifying the analysis. Thus, before starting the analysis, the\nVSI software imports track irregularities and OOR profiles from a MATLAB file, whichto the vertical and lateral irregularities in each rail in each respective position, and adds it to the constraint equations of the system throughout the dynamics analysis. Then, the\nsystem of dynamic equations is solved using the typical Newmark integration method.\nThe impact of track irregularity on wheel defect classification is significant, as a lower track quality tends to result in a higher likelihood of misclassification. A comprehensive\nexploration of this influence was previously undertaken by Mosleh et al. as documented in their research study . Hence, this study does not delve into the impact of track\nquality; rather, it primarily centres on the utilisation of AI-based methodologies for the detection and classification of wheel defects. For this, four different profiles are used, based\non European Standard EN 13848–2 . In this case, power spectral density (PSD) curvesFor OOR defects, several profiles are defined based on real measurements in representative profiles of the various severities. Subsequently, the structural matrices are imported\nMore details on track and train properties, including additional information on traintrack interaction, can be found in previous publications . Figure 1 shows the\nvehicle–track interaction model schematisation and some details about the train and track\nsubsystems, as well as the track irregularities and wheel-rail contact model.According to the conclusions reached in other studies with this type of damage ,\nthe most promising location of the sensors is on the rail. To reduce installation and maintenance costs, it is important to reduce the number of sensors without compromising the\nquality of the results. Therefore, based on a sensitivity analysis performed during the study,\nonly two vertical unidirectional accelerometers were used on each rail, 4 in total (A1 to A4),\nsince they provided a higher cost–benefit ratio. These sensors are mounted on the rail atdefects, different simulation scenarios with perfect wheels (baseline) and OOR wheels\n(damage) were defined for a five-wagon Laagrss freight train. Based on different crossing speeds, loading schemes and rail irregularities profiles, 120 baseline and 180 damage scenarios (90 for polygonal wheels and 90 for wheel flats) were defined, as summarised in For baseline scenarios, six loading schemes with five different speeds (40, 60, 80, 100\nand 120 km/h) and four rail irregularity profiles were considered, giving a total of 120 scenarios. The loading schemes used are: empty, half-loaded, full-loaded and, additionally,For the damage cases, a total of 90 scenarios were generated for polygonal wheels. These\nscenarios including 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (H1, H2 and H3) x 10 different irregularity profiles within each specified harmonic interval. In these 10 irregularity\nprofiles, based on the defect amplitude, two amplitudes are considered, five simulations for\nA1 and five simulations for A2. Similarly, 90 scenarios were created for wheel flats, involving 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (F1, F2 and F3) x 10 different irregularitywheel radius . This wave phenomenon can be characterised by the different wavelengths formed (harmonics θ ), and by the levels of irregularity ( Lw ) associated with each of the harmonics. According to Peng , it is considered a polygonal wheel when the wear amplitude assumes values above 0. mm and wavelengths between 140 mm and the wheelTo define scenarios with polygonal wheels for the Laagrss wagon, a literature survey on\nexperimental measurements in defective wheels was conducted . Three experimental irregularity profiles were collected, illustrated in Figure 3.

The sampling frequency for data acquisition is considered 10 kHz in order to ensure a good problem Figure 6a) shows two baseline cases for two speeds (40 and 100 km/h), where it is possible to observe the influence of speed on the dynamic response. The amplifying effect\nof speed can influence the identification of damage, which is why a robust baseline with a wide range of scenarios is very important. At a speed of 40 km/h, lower accelerations\naround 0. m/s⊃2 are observed. In contrast, at a speed of 100 km/h (considerably higher),\naccelerations increase substantially to around 3. m/s⊃2. This illustrates the significant**Figure 6.** Acceleration time-series in sensor A1 for Laagrss vehicle: (a) influence of speed, (b) influencehigher speeds.

Lastly, Figure 6c) and d), show two acceleration responses for the two types of simulated OOR damages. Compared to a perfect wheel, there is a significant increase of the peak values, more localised in the case of flats ) and more distributed in thethe wheel condition is based on Machine Learning (ML) and comprises several phases,\nsummarised in the flowchart presented in Figure 7. After obtaining the acceleration measurements from the numerical simulations, an FFT algorithm is applied to the time series allowing the conversion of the signal from the time domain to the frequency domain. Then,predefined hyperparameters of the algorithm. The set hyperparameters are encoding and\ndecoding transfer functions, hidden layer size, maximum number of epochs, L2 weight regularisation term, sparsity regularisation term and a sparsity proportion term. Afterwards,**Figure 7.** Flowchart with the main phases of the methodology for detection and classification of OORthe features are extracted in the more compressed layer of the SAE, the so-called bottleneck layer. The number of features obtained is equal to the number of hidden layers which\nis usually considerably lower than the data size, allowing a compression of the input data.\nFurthermore, to enhance the sensitivity to damage, two levels of data fusion are applied to the bottleneck features using the Mahalanobis distance. In the first level, all features are\nfused into a damage index (DI) for each sensor and, in the second level, all the sensors\nare merged resulting in only one DI for each simulation. Finally, automatic damage detection is achieved by performing an outlier analysis, in which a statistical confidence limit\n(CB) is used, based on the Inverse Cumulative Gaussian Distribution Function (ICDF).\nFor feature classification, an automatic clustering process based on the k-means technique is implemented. This algorithm allows for the unsupervised and automatic classification of data, based on the calculation of statistical distances between objects. In k-means technique given a vector of data and chosen k clusters, the key is to find k centroids that minimise\nthe distance of each vector to its nearest centroid . Since it is necessary to define the number of clusters in advance, a global Silhouette index (SIL) was adopted to make\nan automatic process. At the end, the clusters will allow the classification of the two typesbetween the number of correct classifications and the total number of cases.damage detection problems, as it allows a signal to be converted from the time domain to the frequency domain, to capture the excitation frequencies induced by the wheel defects.\nIn addition, a data reduction is carried out at this stage, since the initial records contain aa crossing speed of 80 km/h. When comparing the FFT spectra for a train passage with flats, Figure 8a), with polygonal wheels, Figure 8b), there are visible differences in terms\nof amplitude peak values and excited frequency ranges. For flats, the amplitude peak values are higher and they induce frequencies in the range between DC and 1500accordance with some authors reports . In terms of severities, for flats, the more severe group (55–100 mm) is the one with the higher frequency content, as expected,a baseline response. For polygonal wheels, from the analysis of Figure 8b), it can be seen the frequency peaks for the H12–14 and H17–18 profiles around 100 and 150\nrespectively, while for the profile H6-8 a more flat spectrum is obtained without showing any significant peak. This can be explained by the irregularity level profile of thisThese two graphs can show which frequencies have higher content in the original signal.Autoencoders are artificial neural networks trained using an unsupervised approach,\nwhich aim first to learn coded representations of the data, compressing the input into\na latent space representation, and second, through this compressed information, reconstructing the information. The basic architecture of this type of network consists of threewhere **Wij**, **Wjk** are the weights connection matrices between input layer-hidden\nlayer and hidden layer-output layer, **X** = ( **X** 1, **X** 2, . . ., **Xn** ) is the input data vector,\n**H** = ( **H** 1, . . ., **Hm** ) is the low-dimensional vector and **X** [ˆ] = ( **X** [ˆ] 1, **X** [ˆ] 2, . . ., **X** [ˆ] **n** ) is the output**Figure 8.** Frequency domain responses on position 1 for the crossing speed of 80 km/h: (a) wheel flats,data vector. **b** 1, **b** 2 are bias vectors and σ 1, σ 2 are the activation function used in each of thereconstruction of the input X [ˆ], as shown in Equation (3). This function uses the meanIn the Sparse Autoencoder, to make the coding more efficient, two regularisation terms,\nsparse penalty term and weight regularisation term, are added to the error function, causing only a subset of neurons to be activated. The average activation of neurons in the hiddenAs the average activation ˆ ρ is intended to be close to a constant ρ (sparsity proportion)\nand it is usually a small positive number near 0, the Kullback-Leibler (KL) divergence isIn addition to this, a weight regularisation term, called L2 regularisation, is also addedwhere L is the number of hidden layers, nl the output size of layer l, kl the input size ofwhere μ is the coefficient for the L2 regularisation term and β the coefficient for the sparsityAfter data pre-processing, the acceleration responses in the frequency domain, are then In this work, two layers of SAE’s were used to form the network, as shown in Figure 9.layers, with the outputs of the previous autoencoder serving as input for the next one. After incorporating various inputs into the SSAE training, they are integrated into the so-called\n‘Input 1’. As training progresses, the data is compressed, and the main characteristics of the signals are obtained and retained in ‘Bottleneck 1’. Subsequently, these characteristics are\nused as input for training the second sparse autoencoder, which, after further compression,\nenables the extraction of the final features. Depending on the type of data under analysis,\nthe compression level differs, so multiple tests should be conducted to optimise these layer sizes. This optimisation was achieved by trial and test, changing both the size of the first\nIt should be noted that this network architecture, where the dimensions of the layers gradually decrease along the network until reaching the bottleneck layer , has proven\nto be highly robust for the type of data used. It allows for effective compression of results**Figure 9.** Schematic of the structure of the SSAE neural network used in this study.After extracting the features from the bottleneck layer of the SSAE, the difference between the healthy wheels scenarios and the damage wheels scenarios is still not sufficient. Hence\na data fusion is performed. With this fusion, it is possible to increase the sensitivity of the\nfeatures, and as a result, to obtain a damage index (DI) for each simulation. Thus, the Mahalanobis distance (MD) is used to reduce the volume of extracted data and preserve the most relevant information . Briefly, MD is a metric that measures the distance between two points in a feature space consisting of two or more variables, being independent of the\nscale of the features, thus allowing an increase in the sensitivity of the features to cases with damage. The MD, denoted here as DI, is calculated for each simulation using the followingin which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−], and ¯ x is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The MD is calculated for each sensor and for each simulation, obtaining a matrix of n distances per k number of sensors.Finally, the discrimination of the features consists in distinguishing the features as corresponding to a healthy or damaged case. At this stage of the methodology, an analysis of\nabnormal values is carried out, which will allow the condition of the train wheels to beautomatically monitored and these values to be classified into different classes. This phaseThe outlier analysis consists of grouping, by probabilistic distribution processes, the datato the previously created group. For this, a statistical confidence limit (CB) is used, based on the inverse cumulative Gaussian distribution function (ICDF), considering the mean\nvalue, ¯ μ, and standard deviation, σ, of the baseline feature vector.Whenever a value of a DI indicator is equal to or greater than CB, it is considered an outlier (the null hypothesis is rejected), thus representing a case of damage.For feature classification, a clustering process is used to divide the dataset into distinct clusters that should be as compact and separated as possible . For clustering, the k-meanson the distances of their vectors. Recent studies showed that the k-means algorithm has shown promising results . The main limitation of this technique is that it requires\nknowledge of the number of clusters in advance. For this purpose, the global silhouetteThis section presents the main results obtained through the application of the methodology proposed in section 3 to the calculated track responses. The methodology is applied using damaged wheel passages for the three simulated train speeds (60, 80 and 100 km/h),hyperparameters (presented in section 3). By adjusting these hyperparameters, it is possible to make the algorithm more efficient and improve the generalisation capabilities, as only\nthe most important features are retained. The optimisation of these hyperparameters isof data under analysis. Based on the principles of the SAE already outlined in other works\nIn the context of this study, the non-linear transfer functions (logsig) proved to be more effective than the linear ones, being the ones used in all the studied cases. After analysing Table 3, there is a similarity in the hyperparameters when comparing the two types of OOR damage. It is observed that the data compression level is the same for both cases, around\n93%, as 500 features are extracted in Bottleneck 2 from the initial input data with 7000\nConcerning the type of damage situation, the size of the ‘Bottleneck 1’ and ‘Bottleneck\n2’ was increased to bring them even closer to the initial amount of input data. This can beanalysis, making it challenging for the autoencoder to define relationships between the data, hence requiring a larger number. On the contrary, the maximum number of epochsIt is also important to emphasise that of the various hyperparameters presented, theOnce the hyperparameters have been defined, all the steps of the methodology are applied to the new dataset. For simplicity, in this section, only the last phase of the methodology will be presented, namely an outlier analysis for damage detection and cluster analysis for damage classification. For each sensor, a matrix n × m is created, where n\nis the number of test passages (baseline scenarios + damage scenarios), and m represents the number of extracted features. So, the size of the matrices is 210 × 2000 in case of the\ntype of damage, 75 × 500 for each amplitude in polygonal wheel, and 120 × 500 for wheelDespite the visual distinction between healthy and damaged wheels based on the data processing presented in subsection 3.2, unsupervised learning must use strategies capable of automatically detecting damage. To this end, an outlier analysis is employed, which consists of defining a confidence threshold using a significance level of 1% , represented**Figure 10.** Automatic OOR damage detection based on outlier analysis.by the green line in Figure 10. This approach makes it possible to successfully detect allTo distinguish the two types of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed. Figure 11\nshows a clear distinction between the damage, even when using a dataset with three different train speeds (60,80 and 100 km/h).. In the case of Figure 11a), using all four\naccelerometers, it is possible to efficiently separate the set into two large clusters, despite\n30 misclassifications (16 in the polygonisation and 14 in the flats). Even so, the accuracy\npercentage is around 85%, which is a very good result. To analyse the sensitivity to the number of sensors, only two sensors were used, one on each side ). The results\nimproved, with a decrease in the number of misclassifications from 30 to 21 (13 for polygonisation and 8 for flats). One explanation could be the disparity in sensor sensitivity to the damage, where some sensors are more sensitive than others due to their spatial positioning in relation to the damage. By merging the data from the less sensitive sensors with the\nmore sensitive ones, this could have a negative impact on the results. Thus, the percentage\nThe purpose behind presenting these two plots was to demonstrate that, whether using 4 sensors or 2 sensors, the classification remains remarkably robust, showing lowAfter identifying the type of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed once again to\nclassify the severity of each damage separately. Regarding polygonal wheels, the classification involves both amplitude and harmonic orders, leading to the clusters depicted in the obtained clusters reasonably reflect the two amplitude groups, with all misclassifications associated with the H6-8 harmonic cases (17 misclassifications). Once the amplitude\nis identified, harmonic classification must be carried out separately for each of the amplitudes. In Figure 12b), related to amplitude A1, it is observed that the obtained clusters**Figure 11.** Automatic OOR damage classification based on cluster analysis using: a) 4 sensors; b) 2are nearly perfect, with only 3 misclassifications. In Figure 12c), there are only 3 misclassifications, totalling 8 misclassifications in the classification of the number of dominant\nThe classification of harmonic order is only possible with the separation of amplitudes,\nFigure 13 presents the clusters obtained for the wheel flat cases. The separation between\nthe less severe group and baseline cases and intermediate (cluster 3) and severe cases (cluster 4) is reduced, resulting in a total of 19 misclassifications. Nevertheless, this result showsrate of about 84%. One possible reason for this significant number of misclassifications could be directly associated with the number of impacts captured by the sensor.In order to contribute to the safety of railway transportation and service quality, an automatic methodology based on machine learning has been proposed. This methodology can accurately detect and classify two types of OOR wheel damage in railway vehicles allowing to mitigate problems at both track and vehicle level, such as derailments or material\ndegradation. It includes a new technique for feature extraction based on a dedicated neural network, the Sparse Autoencoder. This non-linear technique is an upgrade concerning the commonly used linear techniques for feature extraction since it allows a better normalisation of the operational effects in the analysed data, as well as the reduction of large amounts\nof data without relying on other techniques, while keeping the most valuable information. These improvements are achieved through the use of different hyperparameters in**Figure 12.** Automatic classification of polygonal wheels based on cluster analysis: a) amplitude A1-A2;**Figure 13.** Automatic classification of wheel flats based on cluster analysis.the calculations, such as non-linear activation functions and sparsity terms. Consequently,circulation. Particularly in the railway engineering field, the inclusion of this technique\nshowed a good potential to deal with variable train speeds, essentially due to the amplifying effect on the measured track dynamic responses which could induce errors in damage The application of the methodology to the data set proved to be very successful in detecting and classifying the two types of OOR damages. Damage detection was perfect, without\nany false detection. In terms of classifying the type of damage, the results are very good,\nwith a success rate of around 85%, but if only two accelerometers are considered the successrate increases to around 90%. These results are encouraging since the range of speeds considered in the analysis, between 60 and 100 km/h, is the most representative of in-service\nfreight trains. Also, the results show that including the Sparse Autoencoder has a positive\neffect in the normalization of the train speed in the damage data set.\nRegarding the severity classification for each type of damage, the methodology proved equally successful in clustering the different damage severities. For polygonal wheels, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the severity groups in terms of defect amplitude, failing only for the H6-8 harmonic cases, and in terms of harmonic orders for each amplitude,\nwith almost perfect results. For wheel flats, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the three severity groups, though with some misclassifications between the less severe group\nand baseline cases and between intermediate and severe cases. A success rate of around 86%\nis achieved in the classification of polygonal wheel severities and 84% in the classification of wheel flat severities. Even so, these high success rates of over 80% show the robustness\nof this methodology in damage classification regardless of the train speed.on on-site measurements. Additionally, this methodology could be carried out for other types of railway vehicles, for example, passenger vehicles, since the dynamic responses are\ndifferent from freight vehicles. In that case, exploring other recent types of autoencoders,\nTo increase the complexity of the problem, the objective is to explore the concept of\nmultiple damages (same or different OOR types). For this, it will be necessary to incorporate a new stage in the methodology, the damage location stage, which will make it possible\nto distinguish isolated damage from multiple damage, as well as their respective location.\nThus, damage will be identified using cut signals, which will then be used to classify theThis work is a result of project WAY4SafeRail-WAYside monitoring system FOR SAFE RAIL transportation, with reference NORTE-01-0247-FEDER-069595, co-funded by the European Regional\nDevelopment Fund (ERDF), through the North Portugal Regional Operational Programme\nPartnership Agreement.

Within this context,\nan unsupervised methodology based on artificial intelligence techniques is presented, which allows the detection and classification of wheels, based on dynamic responses induced on the track by crossing freight railway vehicles. The methodology involves the following\nsteps: (i) data collection and pre-processing, (ii) feature extraction (iii)\ndata fusion and (iv) feature discrimination.

However, this type of system entail high costs envisaging the vehicle wheel condition monitoring, since sensors need to be installed in every vehicle in order to achieve a good representativity . On the other hand, wayside systems are a more viable solution for identifying wheel defects, since the condition of allThe most common wheel defects are known as OOR. As the name infers, this defect is related to deformations on the surface of the wheel circumference that make it not round.\nThis deformation can have many forms and different causes, leading to faults on the vehicle and on the track due to the higher dynamic force values [4–6]. The OOR damagesa function of their shape and size, vehicle characteristics and speed [7–10]. Wheel flats induce high dynamic impact loads on the railway infrastructure, which causes significant damage to both tracks and vehicles, such as broken axles, damaged rolling bearings and cracks in the wheels, rails and sleepers . Moreover, it also generates high vibrations\ntransmitted to the rolling stock, inducing significant stresses and causing damage to the In the case of polygonal wheels, the formation mechanism can be roughly classified\ninto three categories, namely, (1) initial wheel defects , (2) a natural vibration of the\nvehicle–track system and (3) thermoelastic instability . The formation mechanism is strongly contingent on the vehicle type and its operational characteristics, withof dominant harmonic orders [19–22]. For example, Tao et al. studied asymmetrical polygonal wear on metro wheels and obtained harmonic orders of 12–14, while another study by Tao et al. found that the most common harmonic order in Chinese freight trains is 18–19. Although a polygonal wheel could generate less impact on the track than a\nwheel flat, this defect can cause serious damage to the track due to resonance effects in the\nTo identify the occurrence of these OOR anomalies in train wheels, innovative\nmethodologies have been developed combining signal processing and automatic learning techniques. These methodologies are based on the extraction of damage sensitivity features, making possible the distinction between undamaged and damaged situations. Recently, many studies have shown good results in detecting OOR damages using\ndistinct approaches [24–29]. Mishra et al. concluded that a single FBG (Fiber Bragg Grating) sensor, positioned along the rail can detect the presence of wheel flats.\nLourenço et al. created an automatic algorithm for diagnosing OOR defects. The\nproposed methodology consists of isolating specific defective wheels and then identifying the severity of the damage, using only acceleration and strain data measured on\nthe track. In another study, Krummenacher et al. , proposed two machine-learningBy extracting the features, it is possible to transform the measured data into an alternative form of information where the correlation with damage is more easily observed. There are various techniques for feature extraction, the most common being CWT\n(continuous wavelet transform) [31–33], PCA (principal component analysis) ,detection of polygonal wheels on freight vehicles using CWT and ARX features, using\n6 accelerometers, 3 on each side of the railway track.

Although these studies have demonstrated robust results in detection, they show some limitations in dealing with the non-linear effects associated with operational effects, such as the train speed. Due to the inability of these linear techniques to attenuate operation effects, the inclusion of different speeds\nFor most of these studies, a feature normalisation stage is used when it is necessary to remove the operational effects. Usually, latent variable methods are used, such as PCA or multiple linear regression (MLR) . Thus, to deal with the non-linear phenomena and reduce the large amounts of data without relying on the aforementioned methods,\nthe first artificial neural networks were created to inherently execute this task . Over the years, new and more advanced networks have been developed, with the Autoencoder\n(AE) being one of the main types. Later, Olshausen et al. proposed the creation of\nsparse coding and Ng et al. introduced a sparse penalisation term in the hidden layer,\nto acquire more compact and effective features from lower-dimensional data. For some datasets with complex relationships between characteristics, employing more than one SAE\nis necessary, which is why stacked sparse autoencoders (SSAE) are commonly used .\nNowadays, these types of AE are widely used in various scientific fields, but specifically\nfor structural engineering only a few studies are found, and most are about damage detection on bridges [45–47].

Pathirage et al. proposed a framework utilizing SAE’s potential for dimensionality reduction, which facilitated the assessment of damage detection performance on Many of these AE algorithms already performed feature classification in order to discriminate the different types of damages and severities. However, the AE methods can also be combined with other techniques commonly used to classify the data. They can be used unsupervised methods, in which the model is trained without any labels provided to the\ntraining dataset, such as k-means , self-organising maps (SOM) , isolation forest, gaussian mixture model , k-medoids and cluster analysis , or supervised\nmethods, which assume that the hierarchy of database categories is known, such as NaiveBayes classifiers , k-Nearest Neighbours classifiers , Support Vector Machinetwo types of OOR damages, flats and polygonal wheels, based on acceleration responses obtained from a virtual wayside monitoring system.

The application of sensors on both sides of theTo obtain the responses from the railway track, it is necessary to apply sensors on the track that can measure the dynamic responses of the crossing trains. As it is not always possible\nto install them due to the high costs involved, simulations have been carried out based on calibrated models of the track , vehicle and considering their dynamic interaction,\nas well as including the track irregularities. Simulations include cases with healthy wheelsTo simulate the dynamic interactions between the vehicle and the track, an in-house software VSI – Vehicle-Structure Interaction Analysis is used, which was initially developed by\nNeves et al. and later improved by Montenegro et al. .

Including the track irregularities directly in the constraint equations are beneficial since it avoids explicitly considering\nthem in the FEM model. Moreover, it also allows to include the wheel and OOR profiles as a periodic rail irregularity, simplifying the analysis. Thus, before starting the analysis, the\nVSI software imports track irregularities and OOR profiles from a MATLAB file, whichto the vertical and lateral irregularities in each rail in each respective position, and adds it to the constraint equations of the system throughout the dynamics analysis. Then, the\nsystem of dynamic equations is solved using the typical Newmark integration method.\nThe impact of track irregularity on wheel defect classification is significant, as a lower track quality tends to result in a higher likelihood of misclassification. A comprehensive\nexploration of this influence was previously undertaken by Mosleh et al. as documented in their research study . Hence, this study does not delve into the impact of track\nquality; rather, it primarily centres on the utilisation of AI-based methodologies for the detection and classification of wheel defects. For this, four different profiles are used, based\non European Standard EN 13848–2 . In this case, power spectral density (PSD) curvesFor OOR defects, several profiles are defined based on real measurements in representative profiles of the various severities. Subsequently, the structural matrices are imported\nMore details on track and train properties, including additional information on traintrack interaction, can be found in previous publications . Figure 1 shows the\nvehicle–track interaction model schematisation and some details about the train and track\nsubsystems, as well as the track irregularities and wheel-rail contact model.According to the conclusions reached in other studies with this type of damage ,\nthe most promising location of the sensors is on the rail. To reduce installation and maintenance costs, it is important to reduce the number of sensors without compromising the\nquality of the results. Therefore, based on a sensitivity analysis performed during the study,\nonly two vertical unidirectional accelerometers were used on each rail, 4 in total (A1 to A4),\nsince they provided a higher cost–benefit ratio. These sensors are mounted on the rail atdefects, different simulation scenarios with perfect wheels (baseline) and OOR wheels\n(damage) were defined for a five-wagon Laagrss freight train. Based on different crossing speeds, loading schemes and rail irregularities profiles, 120 baseline and 180 damage scenarios (90 for polygonal wheels and 90 for wheel flats) were defined, as summarised in For baseline scenarios, six loading schemes with five different speeds (40, 60, 80, 100\nand 120 km/h) and four rail irregularity profiles were considered, giving a total of 120 scenarios. The loading schemes used are: empty, half-loaded, full-loaded and, additionally,For the damage cases, a total of 90 scenarios were generated for polygonal wheels. These\nscenarios including 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (H1, H2 and H3) x 10 different irregularity profiles within each specified harmonic interval. In these 10 irregularity\nprofiles, based on the defect amplitude, two amplitudes are considered, five simulations for\nA1 and five simulations for A2. Similarly, 90 scenarios were created for wheel flats, involving 1 load x 1 irregularity x 3 speeds x 3 severities (F1, F2 and F3) x 10 different irregularitywheel radius . This wave phenomenon can be characterised by the different wavelengths formed (harmonics θ ), and by the levels of irregularity ( Lw ) associated with each of the harmonics. According to Peng , it is considered a polygonal wheel when the wear amplitude assumes values above 0. mm and wavelengths between 140 mm and the wheelTo define scenarios with polygonal wheels for the Laagrss wagon, a literature survey on\nexperimental measurements in defective wheels was conducted . Three experimental irregularity profiles were collected, illustrated in Figure 3. The first group (H6-8)\ncorresponds to a study carried out by Cai et al. with dominant harmonics from 6 to 8;**Figure 3.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) of polygonal wheels with**Figure 4.** Examples of polygonal damage profiles for each of the dominant harmonic intervals.the second group (H12-14) to a study authored by Tao et al. with dominant harmonics from 12 to 14; and the third profile (H17-18) to a study performed by Wu et al. with\nBased on the wheel irregularity spectra ( Lw ) taken from the respective measurement profiles, shown in Figure 3, and considering the contribution of the first 30 harmonics, several irregularity profiles were generated, according to Figure 4.

After obtaining the acceleration measurements from the numerical simulations, an FFT algorithm is applied to the time series allowing the conversion of the signal from the time domain to the frequency domain. Then,predefined hyperparameters of the algorithm. The set hyperparameters are encoding and\ndecoding transfer functions, hidden layer size, maximum number of epochs, L2 weight regularisation term, sparsity regularisation term and a sparsity proportion term. Afterwards,**Figure 7.** Flowchart with the main phases of the methodology for detection and classification of OORthe features are extracted in the more compressed layer of the SAE, the so-called bottleneck layer. The number of features obtained is equal to the number of hidden layers which\nis usually considerably lower than the data size, allowing a compression of the input data.\nFurthermore, to enhance the sensitivity to damage, two levels of data fusion are applied to the bottleneck features using the Mahalanobis distance. In the first level, all features are\nfused into a damage index (DI) for each sensor and, in the second level, all the sensors\nare merged resulting in only one DI for each simulation. Finally, automatic damage detection is achieved by performing an outlier analysis, in which a statistical confidence limit\n(CB) is used, based on the Inverse Cumulative Gaussian Distribution Function (ICDF).\nFor feature classification, an automatic clustering process based on the k-means technique is implemented. This algorithm allows for the unsupervised and automatic classification of data, based on the calculation of statistical distances between objects. In k-means technique given a vector of data and chosen k clusters, the key is to find k centroids that minimise\nthe distance of each vector to its nearest centroid . Since it is necessary to define the number of clusters in advance, a global Silhouette index (SIL) was adopted to make\nan automatic process. At the end, the clusters will allow the classification of the two typesbetween the number of correct classifications and the total number of cases.damage detection problems, as it allows a signal to be converted from the time domain to the frequency domain, to capture the excitation frequencies induced by the wheel defects.\nIn addition, a data reduction is carried out at this stage, since the initial records contain aa crossing speed of 80 km/h. When comparing the FFT spectra for a train passage with flats, Figure 8a), with polygonal wheels, Figure 8b), there are visible differences in terms\nof amplitude peak values and excited frequency ranges. For flats, the amplitude peak values are higher and they induce frequencies in the range between DC and 1500accordance with some authors reports . In terms of severities, for flats, the more severe group (55–100 mm) is the one with the higher frequency content, as expected,a baseline response. For polygonal wheels, from the analysis of Figure 8b), it can be seen the frequency peaks for the H12–14 and H17–18 profiles around 100 and 150\nrespectively, while for the profile H6-8 a more flat spectrum is obtained without showing any significant peak. This can be explained by the irregularity level profile of thisThese two graphs can show which frequencies have higher content in the original signal.Autoencoders are artificial neural networks trained using an unsupervised approach,\nwhich aim first to learn coded representations of the data, compressing the input into\na latent space representation, and second, through this compressed information, reconstructing the information. The basic architecture of this type of network consists of threewhere **Wij**, **Wjk** are the weights connection matrices between input layer-hidden\nlayer and hidden layer-output layer, **X** = ( **X** 1, **X** 2, . . ., **Xn** ) is the input data vector,\n**H** = ( **H** 1, . . ., **Hm** ) is the low-dimensional vector and **X** [ˆ] = ( **X** [ˆ] 1, **X** [ˆ] 2, . . ., **X** [ˆ] **n** ) is the output**Figure 8.** Frequency domain responses on position 1 for the crossing speed of 80 km/h: (a) wheel flats,data vector. **b** 1, **b** 2 are bias vectors and σ 1, σ 2 are the activation function used in each of thereconstruction of the input X [ˆ], as shown in Equation (3).

After incorporating various inputs into the SSAE training, they are integrated into the so-called\n‘Input 1’. As training progresses, the data is compressed, and the main characteristics of the signals are obtained and retained in ‘Bottleneck 1’. Subsequently, these characteristics are\nused as input for training the second sparse autoencoder, which, after further compression,\nenables the extraction of the final features. Depending on the type of data under analysis,\nthe compression level differs, so multiple tests should be conducted to optimise these layer sizes. This optimisation was achieved by trial and test, changing both the size of the first\nIt should be noted that this network architecture, where the dimensions of the layers gradually decrease along the network until reaching the bottleneck layer , has proven\nto be highly robust for the type of data used. It allows for effective compression of results**Figure 9.** Schematic of the structure of the SSAE neural network used in this study.After extracting the features from the bottleneck layer of the SSAE, the difference between the healthy wheels scenarios and the damage wheels scenarios is still not sufficient. Hence\na data fusion is performed. With this fusion, it is possible to increase the sensitivity of the\nfeatures, and as a result, to obtain a damage index (DI) for each simulation. Thus, the Mahalanobis distance (MD) is used to reduce the volume of extracted data and preserve the most relevant information . Briefly, MD is a metric that measures the distance between two points in a feature space consisting of two or more variables, being independent of the\nscale of the features, thus allowing an increase in the sensitivity of the features to cases with damage. The MD, denoted here as DI, is calculated for each simulation using the followingin which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−], and ¯ x is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The MD is calculated for each sensor and for each simulation, obtaining a matrix of n distances per k number of sensors.Finally, the discrimination of the features consists in distinguishing the features as corresponding to a healthy or damaged case. At this stage of the methodology, an analysis of\nabnormal values is carried out, which will allow the condition of the train wheels to beautomatically monitored and these values to be classified into different classes. This phaseThe outlier analysis consists of grouping, by probabilistic distribution processes, the datato the previously created group. For this, a statistical confidence limit (CB) is used, based on the inverse cumulative Gaussian distribution function (ICDF), considering the mean\nvalue, ¯ μ, and standard deviation, σ, of the baseline feature vector.Whenever a value of a DI indicator is equal to or greater than CB, it is considered an outlier (the null hypothesis is rejected), thus representing a case of damage.For feature classification, a clustering process is used to divide the dataset into distinct clusters that should be as compact and separated as possible . For clustering, the k-meanson the distances of their vectors. Recent studies showed that the k-means algorithm has shown promising results . The main limitation of this technique is that it requires\nknowledge of the number of clusters in advance. For this purpose, the global silhouetteThis section presents the main results obtained through the application of the methodology proposed in section 3 to the calculated track responses. The methodology is applied using damaged wheel passages for the three simulated train speeds (60, 80 and 100 km/h),hyperparameters (presented in section 3). By adjusting these hyperparameters, it is possible to make the algorithm more efficient and improve the generalisation capabilities, as only\nthe most important features are retained. The optimisation of these hyperparameters isof data under analysis. Based on the principles of the SAE already outlined in other works\nIn the context of this study, the non-linear transfer functions (logsig) proved to be more effective than the linear ones, being the ones used in all the studied cases. After analysing Table 3, there is a similarity in the hyperparameters when comparing the two types of OOR damage. It is observed that the data compression level is the same for both cases, around\n93%, as 500 features are extracted in Bottleneck 2 from the initial input data with 7000\nConcerning the type of damage situation, the size of the ‘Bottleneck 1’ and ‘Bottleneck\n2’ was increased to bring them even closer to the initial amount of input data. This can beanalysis, making it challenging for the autoencoder to define relationships between the data, hence requiring a larger number. On the contrary, the maximum number of epochsIt is also important to emphasise that of the various hyperparameters presented, theOnce the hyperparameters have been defined, all the steps of the methodology are applied to the new dataset. For simplicity, in this section, only the last phase of the methodology will be presented, namely an outlier analysis for damage detection and cluster analysis for damage classification. For each sensor, a matrix n × m is created, where n\nis the number of test passages (baseline scenarios + damage scenarios), and m represents the number of extracted features. So, the size of the matrices is 210 × 2000 in case of the\ntype of damage, 75 × 500 for each amplitude in polygonal wheel, and 120 × 500 for wheelDespite the visual distinction between healthy and damaged wheels based on the data processing presented in subsection 3.2, unsupervised learning must use strategies capable of automatically detecting damage. To this end, an outlier analysis is employed, which consists of defining a confidence threshold using a significance level of 1% , represented**Figure 10.** Automatic OOR damage detection based on outlier analysis.by the green line in Figure 10. This approach makes it possible to successfully detect allTo distinguish the two types of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed. Figure 11\nshows a clear distinction between the damage, even when using a dataset with three different train speeds (60,80 and 100 km/h).. In the case of Figure 11a), using all four\naccelerometers, it is possible to efficiently separate the set into two large clusters, despite\n30 misclassifications (16 in the polygonisation and 14 in the flats). Even so, the accuracy\npercentage is around 85%, which is a very good result. To analyse the sensitivity to the number of sensors, only two sensors were used, one on each side ). The results\nimproved, with a decrease in the number of misclassifications from 30 to 21 (13 for polygonisation and 8 for flats). One explanation could be the disparity in sensor sensitivity to the damage, where some sensors are more sensitive than others due to their spatial positioning in relation to the damage. By merging the data from the less sensitive sensors with the\nmore sensitive ones, this could have a negative impact on the results. Thus, the percentage\nThe purpose behind presenting these two plots was to demonstrate that, whether using 4 sensors or 2 sensors, the classification remains remarkably robust, showing lowAfter identifying the type of OOR damage, a cluster analysis is performed once again to\nclassify the severity of each damage separately. Regarding polygonal wheels, the classification involves both amplitude and harmonic orders, leading to the clusters depicted in the obtained clusters reasonably reflect the two amplitude groups, with all misclassifications associated with the H6-8 harmonic cases (17 misclassifications). Once the amplitude\nis identified, harmonic classification must be carried out separately for each of the amplitudes. In Figure 12b), related to amplitude A1, it is observed that the obtained clusters**Figure 11.** Automatic OOR damage classification based on cluster analysis using: a) 4 sensors; b) 2are nearly perfect, with only 3 misclassifications. In Figure 12c), there are only 3 misclassifications, totalling 8 misclassifications in the classification of the number of dominant\nThe classification of harmonic order is only possible with the separation of amplitudes,\nFigure 13 presents the clusters obtained for the wheel flat cases. The separation between\nthe less severe group and baseline cases and intermediate (cluster 3) and severe cases (cluster 4) is reduced, resulting in a total of 19 misclassifications. Nevertheless, this result showsrate of about 84%. One possible reason for this significant number of misclassifications could be directly associated with the number of impacts captured by the sensor.In order to contribute to the safety of railway transportation and service quality, an automatic methodology based on machine learning has been proposed. This methodology can accurately detect and classify two types of OOR wheel damage in railway vehicles allowing to mitigate problems at both track and vehicle level, such as derailments or material\ndegradation. It includes a new technique for feature extraction based on a dedicated neural network, the Sparse Autoencoder. This non-linear technique is an upgrade concerning the commonly used linear techniques for feature extraction since it allows a better normalisation of the operational effects in the analysed data, as well as the reduction of large amounts\nof data without relying on other techniques, while keeping the most valuable information. These improvements are achieved through the use of different hyperparameters in**Figure 12.** Automatic classification of polygonal wheels based on cluster analysis: a) amplitude A1-A2;**Figure 13.** Automatic classification of wheel flats based on cluster analysis.the calculations, such as non-linear activation functions and sparsity terms. Consequently,circulation. Particularly in the railway engineering field, the inclusion of this technique\nshowed a good potential to deal with variable train speeds, essentially due to the amplifying effect on the measured track dynamic responses which could induce errors in damage The application of the methodology to the data set proved to be very successful in detecting and classifying the two types of OOR damages. Damage detection was perfect, without\nany false detection. In terms of classifying the type of damage, the results are very good,\nwith a success rate of around 85%, but if only two accelerometers are considered the successrate increases to around 90%. These results are encouraging since the range of speeds considered in the analysis, between 60 and 100 km/h, is the most representative of in-service\nfreight trains. Also, the results show that including the Sparse Autoencoder has a positive\neffect in the normalization of the train speed in the damage data set.\nRegarding the severity classification for each type of damage, the methodology proved equally successful in clustering the different damage severities. For polygonal wheels, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the severity groups in terms of defect amplitude, failing only for the H6-8 harmonic cases, and in terms of harmonic orders for each amplitude,\nwith almost perfect results. For wheel flats, the methodology efficiently distinguishes the three severity groups, though with some misclassifications between the less severe group\nand baseline cases and between intermediate and severe cases. A success rate of around 86%\nis achieved in the classification of polygonal wheel severities and 84% in the classification of wheel flat severities. Even so, these high success rates of over 80% show the robustness\nof this methodology in damage classification regardless of the train speed.on on-site measurements. Additionally, this methodology could be carried out for other types of railway vehicles, for example, passenger vehicles, since the dynamic responses are\ndifferent from freight vehicles. In that case, exploring other recent types of autoencoders,\nTo increase the complexity of the problem, the objective is to explore the concept of\nmultiple damages (same or different OOR types). For this, it will be necessary to incorporate a new stage in the methodology, the damage location stage, which will make it possible\nto distinguish isolated damage from multiple damage, as well as their respective location.\nThus, damage will be identified using cut signals, which will then be used to classify theThis work is a result of project WAY4SafeRail-WAYside monitoring system FOR SAFE RAIL transportation, with reference NORTE-01-0247-FEDER-069595, co-funded by the European Regional\nDevelopment Fund (ERDF), through the North Portugal Regional Operational Programme\nPartnership Agreement.
