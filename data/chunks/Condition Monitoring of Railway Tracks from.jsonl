Conclusions**In this study, we analysed the effects of railway track irregularities on car-body vibrations through railway vehicle travel simulations conducted by using the SIMPACK software package. We subsequently developed an algorithm based on machine learning to diagnose track conditions by extracting features to detect track irregularities.We used the developed algorithm to detect track faults from the car-body vibrati", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Condition Monitoring of Railway Tracks from", "section": "ROOT", "level": 0, "chunk_id": 43, "year": "2016"}}
