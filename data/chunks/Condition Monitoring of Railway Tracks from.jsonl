Additionally, recent studies proposed employing a Kalman filter to predict track\nirregularities from the acceleration measurements of car-body vibrations of railway vehicles .\nMoreover, on regional railway lines, many operators are unable to implement adequate\ninspections owing to problems such as cost and personnel constraints. Hence, low-cost monitoring systems have been developed based on on-board sensing devices and global navigation satellite system\n(GNSS) data. In this system, the sensing device is installed in an in-service vehicle to measure car-body vibrations. The diagnosis is performed by rating the track conditions based on the measurement data.\nPresently, however, the rating needs to be calculated manually. It is difficult to address a large volume of automatically collected data. To enable the efficient computational processing of collected data,In the present study, we adopted machine learning techniques and developed an algorithm to automatically diagnose track conditions from car-body vibrations to automatically detect track\nirregularities and identify them by type. We subsequently performed a simulation to verify the effectiveness of the developed algorithm. In addition, we examined the possibility of diagnosing trackThe monitoring of railway track geometry from an in-service vehicle became increasingly\nattractive over the past decade . Track geometry measurement systems using in-service vehicles have been developed worldwide, although they are still in the developing stage. The repeated verification\nof the same track provides an opportunity to record track geometry degradation. The obtained information is fed back to the track maintenance section to implement necessary steps.\nSeveral types of track faults are detected by measuring the acceleration of bogies. Weston et al.\ndemonstrated track irregularity monitoring by using bogie-mounted sensors . Alfi et al. proposed a technique to estimate long wavelength track irregularities from on-board measurements . If track\nfaults are detected using car-body mounted sensors, it is easier to perform the condition monitoring of track irregularities.

The results of the diagnosis are fed back to the infrastructure providers where they are used to help create maintenance plans, select work locations, and assign work priorities.Figure 2 shows a photograph of the compact on-board sensing device used in the track condition monitoring system . The device consists of an accelerometer and rate gyroscope for detecting\ntrack errors, a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver for detecting the train location and\nspeed, and a sensor interface for feeding the signals from the sensors to the computer.The system is battery-powered and conducts continuous measurements for up to six hours,\nand thus measurements are simply obtained by placing it in a car. Measurements are constantly obtained if it is powered by a source on the car. Measurement data are stored into an on-board storage device. Furthermore, the device is equipped with a function to automatically transmit measured data from the on-board storage device to a server via a mobile phone network. The device is further\nequipped with a microphone, and thus, it is also possible to “listen” for corrugation and diagnose either via a mobile phone network or via writing to external media. The diagnostic results produced\nchannels via smartphones or tablet computers. Railway operators use the information to establish the\ntrack maintenance priorities, and thereby facilitate the maintenance planning and work.\nAdditionally, the real-time measurement of vehicle vibrations during in-service operation allows for rapid response, such as emergency track inspection and maintenance, in situations in which vehicle\nvibration observations detect irregularly large deviations from standard control values. Thus, the use of deterioration or other track irregularities, and thereby enables infrastructure providers to conductTrack irregularity inspection includes vertical rail profile, lateral alignment, gauge, cross-level,\ntwist and dipped joint, and corrugation as shown in Figure 3. In the developed monitoring system,\nthe detection of track faults for vertical, lateral alignment, and cross-level is possible by usingof derailments. Thus, they are among the most important items that are monitored. Vehicle vibrations are strongly correlated with track irregularities, and thus the magnitude of vehicle vibrations is\nan effective means for assessing general track condition trends. Thus, sections of track over whichTo analyse the effects of railway track deterioration on car-body vibrations, we performed a railway vehicle travel simulation using SIMPACK, a multibody dynamics software package.\nThe model used for the simulation was a single conventional railway vehicle, the parameters for\nwhich are shown in Table 1. Figure 4 shows the model used in the simulation.The model consists of seven rigid bodies, one car body, two bogies, and four wheelsets,\neach having six degrees of freedom. Thus, 42 degrees of freedom exist in the model. It is necessary to connect each rigid body with an appropriate joint such that the vehicle exhibits a realistic motion.\nOne car-body, two bogies, and four wheelsets were connected by spring and damper elements.\nUsing this vehicle model, we calculated the vertical acceleration, lateral acceleration, and roll rate above the centre of the front bogie at the car body. This simulation study is carried out based on the\nstraight track. Alignment irregularity in curved track is not considered in this paper but should beTrack irregularities can be used as an index for managing track conditions. The types of\ntrack irregularities include longitudinal level irregularities that indicate vertical rail displacement,\nalignment irregularities that indicate lateral rail displacement, and cross level irregularities that indicate a difference in the elevation of the left and right rails. Because a high degree of correlation exists\nbetween these track irregularities and car-body vibrations, the magnitude of car-body vibrations can be an effective method to determine track conditions . The track-condition monitoring system can\nto detect any longitudinal level irregularities, alignment irregularities, and cross level irregularities.\nTo identify different types of track faults by using machine-learning techniques, it is necessary to extract the features of each type of track irregularity from the car-body vibrations that occur when travelling on a faulty track. The data obtained by learning the extracted features can be used to construct a training model. Subsequently, if unknown car-body vibration data are input to the model,\nthe type of track irregularity and its degradation level can be identified.\nAs shown in Figure 5, we created a baseline track geometry for an assumed regional railway line and a track geometry with increased track irregularities. We subsequently performed a travel\nsimulation by using a track for which all the longitudinal level irregularities, alignment irregularities,\nand cross level irregularities were within the normal range, and also by using a track for which one type of irregularity was abnormal. Degraded track is generated by the power spectral density of track\nwhere the standard deviation becomes twice as large as the normal track. The travelling distance wasThe acceleration root mean square (RMS) is closely linked to the general health of the running gear and track . Therefore, the acceleration RMS can be used as the primary index to predict the\ntrack condition. First, we need to obtain localised RMS values over short time intervals with a small window size to obtain the relationship between track condition and position. The RMS value may be### ∑ x j [,] (1)where xj is the measured vertical acceleration, lateral acceleration or roll angular velocity of car-body Track irregularities include longitudinal level irregularities, alignment irregularities, and cross\nlevel irregularities. In order to assess the irregularities, we determine the RMS values of vertical acceleration, lateral acceleration, and roll rate measured by the compact-sized on-board sensing device.be optimised based on the analysis of collected measurement data as the future work.\nFigure 6 shows the results of car-body vibration calculations, which indicate that longitudinal level and alignment irregularities influence the vertical and lateral accelerations, respectively, while cross level irregularities influence both the lateral acceleration and roll rate. The maximum RMS values for the vertical acceleration, lateral acceleration, and roll rate were calculated for each 10 m section.\nThe section length 10 m is decided based on the consideration of GNSS error.\nFigure 7 shows a feature space created by plotting these values in three dimensions. As shown,\nfour clusters are present, representing a normal track, and abnormal tracks with longitudinal level,\nalignment, and cross level irregularities. It is obvious that such a feature space could be used as\ntraining data for machine learning to enable track conditions to be identified.In this study, we used a support vector machine (SVM), which is a type of machine-learning algorithm created to solve two-class classification problems. An SVM identifies the most distant\npoints (“maximum margin”) between two groups and draws a boundary at the centre point between\nthem. A feature of the SVM is that maximising this separation (margin) results in a high degree of\ngeneralisation. Utilising the SVM, we classified track conditions by using the following procedure.First, we classify the obtained data into two classes, “faulty track with longitudinal-level irregularity” or “not.” Next, we classify the data into “faulty track with alignment irregularity”\nor “not.” Subsequently, we classify the data into “faulty track with cross-level irregularity” or “not.”\nFinally, if the data are not classified in the faulty data group, the track is diagnosed as normal. By using\nthe procedure above, the track is diagnosed for every 10 m section with the algorithm.\nWe have not considered for optimising parameters in SVM in this study, but it should beWe performed a vehicle travel simulation using SIMPACK and calculated the car-body vibration when the vehicle was traveling on tracks with different irregularities in some sections. The obtained\nThe track geometry used for the simulation differed from that shown in Figure 8. The track faults were modelled by increasing the reference track irregularities by factors of 1. and 2. times and added to the reference track geometry. Figure 9 shows the modelled track faults. The track geometry used in the simulation was generated by adding the track fault in Figure 8 to the reference track geometry.\nThe total length of the track geometry was 5000 m. Furthermore, 100 faults of longitudinal level,\nalignment, and cross level irregularities were randamly provided in different places.**Figure 9.** Degraded track geometry in some sections. ( **a** ) Longitudinal level geometry. ( **b** ) AlignmentFigure 10 shows the calculation result of the car-body vibrations when a vehicle travels the track geometry shown in Figure 9. As shown in Figure 10, only the vertical or lateral acceleration increases\nwhen the longitudinal level irregularity or the alignment irregularity increase. As shown, both the\nlateral acceleration and roll rate increase when the cross level irregularity increases.**Figure 10.** Calculated car-body vibration by using Figure 9. ( **a** ) Vertical acceleration. ( **b** ) Lateralthe simulated car-body vibration data. For the training data, we used the feature space as shown in Figure 6. The detection results were divided into four classes: normal track, faulty track\nwith longitudinal-level irregularity, faulty track with alignment irregularity, and faulty track with cross-level irregularity. The validity of the detection was evaluated for every 100 faults of longitudinallevel, alignment, and cross level irregularities in 5000 m track lengths. Figure 11 shows the results ofAs shown in Figure 11, the developed algorithm detected the track fault with an accuracy of 80 percent or more for normal and highly degraded tracks. Clearly, the longitudinal level\nirregularity can be detected with high accuracy for normal, intermediate, and highly degraded tracks.\nMeanwhile, the detection accuracy of the alignment and cross level irregularities are lower than that for the longitudinal level irregularity, especially for the intermediately degraded track. However, it is\nnoted that most of the track faults in the regional railway are longitudinal level irregularities.\nTherefore, the developed diagnosis algorithm is considered effective for regional railway lines.\nThe effect of vehicle faults such as wheel flat will appear on the car-body vibration. It is possible to identify the possibility of the faulty train by looking at the measurement data of different places.As an initial test of track fault detection using machine learning, we created clusters of simple features from the car-body vibration data for a regional railway line. To measure the vibration, we used\nan on-board sensing device comprising an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and a GNSS receiver as shown**Figure 12.** Measurement of car-body vibration in a regional railway line.The training data were measured in January, February, May, June, July, and November 2016 for\nsections of the line where repairs for longitudinal level irregularities were performed in October 2016.\nClusters of abnormal track data were created based on the following conditions:• Longitudinal level irregularity: vertical acceleration ≥ 1. m/s• Alignment irregularity: lateral acceleration ≥ 1. m/s and roll rate ≤ 0. rad/sFigure 13 shows the feature space of car-body vibration in a regional railway line. The normal cluster was constructed from car-body vibration data measured in November 2016, immediately after\nlongitudinal level irregularities were repaired. The algorithm detects the location and type of track fault for every 10 m of track. Using the diagnosis algorithm, we diagnosed the track condition in**Figure 13.** Feature space of car-body vibration in a regional railway line.Figure 14 shows the measured RMS values for the car-body vibrations and the results obtained by the detection algorithm (colour map in the upper part of each figure). Locations where the RMS\nvalues for vertical acceleration, lateral acceleration, and roll rate are large are successfully diagnosed\nas longitudinal level, alignment, and cross level irregularities, respectively.\nAs shown, multiple track faults were detected in location from 25. km to 25. km. The results indicated that combined faults can be detected by the developed algorithm. Therefore, we can conclude**Figure 14.** Detection results for regional railway line.

Track geometry measurement systems using in-service vehicles have been developed worldwide, although they are still in the developing stage. The repeated verification\nof the same track provides an opportunity to record track geometry degradation. The obtained information is fed back to the track maintenance section to implement necessary steps.\nSeveral types of track faults are detected by measuring the acceleration of bogies. Weston et al.\ndemonstrated track irregularity monitoring by using bogie-mounted sensors . Alfi et al. proposed a technique to estimate long wavelength track irregularities from on-board measurements . If track\nfaults are detected using car-body mounted sensors, it is easier to perform the condition monitoring of track irregularities.

The results of the diagnosis are fed back to the infrastructure providers where they are used to help create maintenance plans, select work locations, and assign work priorities.Figure 2 shows a photograph of the compact on-board sensing device used in the track condition monitoring system . The device consists of an accelerometer and rate gyroscope for detecting\ntrack errors, a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver for detecting the train location and\nspeed, and a sensor interface for feeding the signals from the sensors to the computer.The system is battery-powered and conducts continuous measurements for up to six hours,\nand thus measurements are simply obtained by placing it in a car. Measurements are constantly obtained if it is powered by a source on the car. Measurement data are stored into an on-board storage device. Furthermore, the device is equipped with a function to automatically transmit measured data from the on-board storage device to a server via a mobile phone network. The device is further\nequipped with a microphone, and thus, it is also possible to “listen” for corrugation and diagnose either via a mobile phone network or via writing to external media. The diagnostic results produced\nchannels via smartphones or tablet computers. Railway operators use the information to establish the\ntrack maintenance priorities, and thereby facilitate the maintenance planning and work.\nAdditionally, the real-time measurement of vehicle vibrations during in-service operation allows for rapid response, such as emergency track inspection and maintenance, in situations in which vehicle\nvibration observations detect irregularly large deviations from standard control values. Thus, the use of deterioration or other track irregularities, and thereby enables infrastructure providers to conductTrack irregularity inspection includes vertical rail profile, lateral alignment, gauge, cross-level,\ntwist and dipped joint, and corrugation as shown in Figure 3. In the developed monitoring system,\nthe detection of track faults for vertical, lateral alignment, and cross-level is possible by usingof derailments. Thus, they are among the most important items that are monitored. Vehicle vibrations are strongly correlated with track irregularities, and thus the magnitude of vehicle vibrations is\nan effective means for assessing general track condition trends. Thus, sections of track over whichTo analyse the effects of railway track deterioration on car-body vibrations, we performed a railway vehicle travel simulation using SIMPACK, a multibody dynamics software package.\nThe model used for the simulation was a single conventional railway vehicle, the parameters for\nwhich are shown in Table 1. Figure 4 shows the model used in the simulation.The model consists of seven rigid bodies, one car body, two bogies, and four wheelsets,\neach having six degrees of freedom. Thus, 42 degrees of freedom exist in the model. It is necessary to connect each rigid body with an appropriate joint such that the vehicle exhibits a realistic motion.\nOne car-body, two bogies, and four wheelsets were connected by spring and damper elements.\nUsing this vehicle model, we calculated the vertical acceleration, lateral acceleration, and roll rate above the centre of the front bogie at the car body. This simulation study is carried out based on the\nstraight track. Alignment irregularity in curved track is not considered in this paper but should beTrack irregularities can be used as an index for managing track conditions. The types of\ntrack irregularities include longitudinal level irregularities that indicate vertical rail displacement,\nalignment irregularities that indicate lateral rail displacement, and cross level irregularities that indicate a difference in the elevation of the left and right rails. Because a high degree of correlation exists\nbetween these track irregularities and car-body vibrations, the magnitude of car-body vibrations can be an effective method to determine track conditions . The track-condition monitoring system can\nto detect any longitudinal level irregularities, alignment irregularities, and cross level irregularities.\nTo identify different types of track faults by using machine-learning techniques, it is necessary to extract the features of each type of track irregularity from the car-body vibrations that occur when travelling on a faulty track. The data obtained by learning the extracted features can be used to construct a training model. Subsequently, if unknown car-body vibration data are input to the model,\nthe type of track irregularity and its degradation level can be identified.\nAs shown in Figure 5, we created a baseline track geometry for an assumed regional railway line and a track geometry with increased track irregularities. We subsequently performed a travel\nsimulation by using a track for which all the longitudinal level irregularities, alignment irregularities,\nand cross level irregularities were within the normal range, and also by using a track for which one type of irregularity was abnormal. Degraded track is generated by the power spectral density of track\nwhere the standard deviation becomes twice as large as the normal track. The travelling distance wasThe acceleration root mean square (RMS) is closely linked to the general health of the running gear and track . Therefore, the acceleration RMS can be used as the primary index to predict the\ntrack condition. First, we need to obtain localised RMS values over short time intervals with a small window size to obtain the relationship between track condition and position. The RMS value may be### ∑ x j [,] (1)where xj is the measured vertical acceleration, lateral acceleration or roll angular velocity of car-body Track irregularities include longitudinal level irregularities, alignment irregularities, and cross\nlevel irregularities. In order to assess the irregularities, we determine the RMS values of vertical acceleration, lateral acceleration, and roll rate measured by the compact-sized on-board sensing device.be optimised based on the analysis of collected measurement data as the future work.\nFigure 6 shows the results of car-body vibration calculations, which indicate that longitudinal level and alignment irregularities influence the vertical and lateral accelerations, respectively, while cross level irregularities influence both the lateral acceleration and roll rate. The maximum RMS values for the vertical acceleration, lateral acceleration, and roll rate were calculated for each 10 m section.\nThe section length 10 m is decided based on the consideration of GNSS error.\nFigure 7 shows a feature space created by plotting these values in three dimensions. As shown,\nfour clusters are present, representing a normal track, and abnormal tracks with longitudinal level,\nalignment, and cross level irregularities. It is obvious that such a feature space could be used as\ntraining data for machine learning to enable track conditions to be identified.In this study, we used a support vector machine (SVM), which is a type of machine-learning algorithm created to solve two-class classification problems. An SVM identifies the most distant\npoints (“maximum margin”) between two groups and draws a boundary at the centre point between\nthem. A feature of the SVM is that maximising this separation (margin) results in a high degree of\ngeneralisation. Utilising the SVM, we classified track conditions by using the following procedure.First, we classify the obtained data into two classes, “faulty track with longitudinal-level irregularity” or “not.” Next, we classify the data into “faulty track with alignment irregularity”\nor “not.” Subsequently, we classify the data into “faulty track with cross-level irregularity” or “not.”\nFinally, if the data are not classified in the faulty data group, the track is diagnosed as normal. By using\nthe procedure above, the track is diagnosed for every 10 m section with the algorithm.\nWe have not considered for optimising parameters in SVM in this study, but it should beWe performed a vehicle travel simulation using SIMPACK and calculated the car-body vibration when the vehicle was traveling on tracks with different irregularities in some sections. The obtained\nThe track geometry used for the simulation differed from that shown in Figure 8. The track faults were modelled by increasing the reference track irregularities by factors of 1. and 2. times and added to the reference track geometry. Figure 9 shows the modelled track faults. The track geometry used in the simulation was generated by adding the track fault in Figure 8 to the reference track geometry.\nThe total length of the track geometry was 5000 m. Furthermore, 100 faults of longitudinal level,\nalignment, and cross level irregularities were randamly provided in different places.**Figure 9.** Degraded track geometry in some sections. ( **a** ) Longitudinal level geometry. ( **b** ) AlignmentFigure 10 shows the calculation result of the car-body vibrations when a vehicle travels the track geometry shown in Figure 9. As shown in Figure 10, only the vertical or lateral acceleration increases\nwhen the longitudinal level irregularity or the alignment irregularity increase. As shown, both the\nlateral acceleration and roll rate increase when the cross level irregularity increases.**Figure 10.** Calculated car-body vibration by using Figure 9. ( **a** ) Vertical acceleration. ( **b** ) Lateralthe simulated car-body vibration data. For the training data, we used the feature space as shown in Figure 6. The detection results were divided into four classes: normal track, faulty track\nwith longitudinal-level irregularity, faulty track with alignment irregularity, and faulty track with cross-level irregularity. The validity of the detection was evaluated for every 100 faults of longitudinallevel, alignment, and cross level irregularities in 5000 m track lengths. Figure 11 shows the results ofAs shown in Figure 11, the developed algorithm detected the track fault with an accuracy of 80 percent or more for normal and highly degraded tracks. Clearly, the longitudinal level\nirregularity can be detected with high accuracy for normal, intermediate, and highly degraded tracks.\nMeanwhile, the detection accuracy of the alignment and cross level irregularities are lower than that for the longitudinal level irregularity, especially for the intermediately degraded track. However, it is\nnoted that most of the track faults in the regional railway are longitudinal level irregularities.\nTherefore, the developed diagnosis algorithm is considered effective for regional railway lines.\nThe effect of vehicle faults such as wheel flat will appear on the car-body vibration. It is possible to identify the possibility of the faulty train by looking at the measurement data of different places.As an initial test of track fault detection using machine learning, we created clusters of simple features from the car-body vibration data for a regional railway line. To measure the vibration, we used\nan on-board sensing device comprising an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and a GNSS receiver as shown**Figure 12.** Measurement of car-body vibration in a regional railway line.The training data were measured in January, February, May, June, July, and November 2016 for\nsections of the line where repairs for longitudinal level irregularities were performed in October 2016.\nClusters of abnormal track data were created based on the following conditions:• Longitudinal level irregularity: vertical acceleration ≥ 1. m/s• Alignment irregularity: lateral acceleration ≥ 1. m/s and roll rate ≤ 0. rad/sFigure 13 shows the feature space of car-body vibration in a regional railway line. The normal cluster was constructed from car-body vibration data measured in November 2016, immediately after\nlongitudinal level irregularities were repaired. The algorithm detects the location and type of track fault for every 10 m of track. Using the diagnosis algorithm, we diagnosed the track condition in**Figure 13.** Feature space of car-body vibration in a regional railway line.Figure 14 shows the measured RMS values for the car-body vibrations and the results obtained by the detection algorithm (colour map in the upper part of each figure).

Utilising the SVM, we classified track conditions by using the following procedure.First, we classify the obtained data into two classes, “faulty track with longitudinal-level irregularity” or “not.” Next, we classify the data into “faulty track with alignment irregularity”\nor “not.” Subsequently, we classify the data into “faulty track with cross-level irregularity” or “not.”\nFinally, if the data are not classified in the faulty data group, the track is diagnosed as normal. By using\nthe procedure above, the track is diagnosed for every 10 m section with the algorithm.\nWe have not considered for optimising parameters in SVM in this study, but it should beWe performed a vehicle travel simulation using SIMPACK and calculated the car-body vibration when the vehicle was traveling on tracks with different irregularities in some sections. The obtained\nThe track geometry used for the simulation differed from that shown in Figure 8. The track faults were modelled by increasing the reference track irregularities by factors of 1. and 2. times and added to the reference track geometry. Figure 9 shows the modelled track faults. The track geometry used in the simulation was generated by adding the track fault in Figure 8 to the reference track geometry.\nThe total length of the track geometry was 5000 m. Furthermore, 100 faults of longitudinal level,\nalignment, and cross level irregularities were randamly provided in different places.**Figure 9.** Degraded track geometry in some sections. ( **a** ) Longitudinal level geometry. ( **b** ) AlignmentFigure 10 shows the calculation result of the car-body vibrations when a vehicle travels the track geometry shown in Figure 9. As shown in Figure 10, only the vertical or lateral acceleration increases\nwhen the longitudinal level irregularity or the alignment irregularity increase. As shown, both the\nlateral acceleration and roll rate increase when the cross level irregularity increases.**Figure 10.** Calculated car-body vibration by using Figure 9. ( **a** ) Vertical acceleration. ( **b** ) Lateralthe simulated car-body vibration data. For the training data, we used the feature space as shown in Figure 6. The detection results were divided into four classes: normal track, faulty track\nwith longitudinal-level irregularity, faulty track with alignment irregularity, and faulty track with cross-level irregularity. The validity of the detection was evaluated for every 100 faults of longitudinallevel, alignment, and cross level irregularities in 5000 m track lengths. Figure 11 shows the results ofAs shown in Figure 11, the developed algorithm detected the track fault with an accuracy of 80 percent or more for normal and highly degraded tracks. Clearly, the longitudinal level\nirregularity can be detected with high accuracy for normal, intermediate, and highly degraded tracks.\nMeanwhile, the detection accuracy of the alignment and cross level irregularities are lower than that for the longitudinal level irregularity, especially for the intermediately degraded track. However, it is\nnoted that most of the track faults in the regional railway are longitudinal level irregularities.\nTherefore, the developed diagnosis algorithm is considered effective for regional railway lines.\nThe effect of vehicle faults such as wheel flat will appear on the car-body vibration. It is possible to identify the possibility of the faulty train by looking at the measurement data of different places.As an initial test of track fault detection using machine learning, we created clusters of simple features from the car-body vibration data for a regional railway line. To measure the vibration, we used\nan on-board sensing device comprising an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and a GNSS receiver as shown**Figure 12.** Measurement of car-body vibration in a regional railway line.The training data were measured in January, February, May, June, July, and November 2016 for\nsections of the line where repairs for longitudinal level irregularities were performed in October 2016.\nClusters of abnormal track data were created based on the following conditions:• Longitudinal level irregularity: vertical acceleration ≥ 1. m/s• Alignment irregularity: lateral acceleration ≥ 1. m/s and roll rate ≤ 0. rad/sFigure 13 shows the feature space of car-body vibration in a regional railway line. The normal cluster was constructed from car-body vibration data measured in November 2016, immediately after\nlongitudinal level irregularities were repaired. The algorithm detects the location and type of track fault for every 10 m of track. Using the diagnosis algorithm, we diagnosed the track condition in**Figure 13.** Feature space of car-body vibration in a regional railway line.Figure 14 shows the measured RMS values for the car-body vibrations and the results obtained by the detection algorithm (colour map in the upper part of each figure).

The results indicated that combined faults can be detected by the developed algorithm. Therefore, we can conclude**Figure 14.** Detection results for regional railway line.

Further, it is desirable to monitor tracks frequently.\nThe deformations that occur in tracks, referred to as track irregularities, are closely connected to the riding quality and safety of railway vehicles.

Additionally, recent studies proposed employing a Kalman filter to predict track\nirregularities from the acceleration measurements of car-body vibrations of railway vehicles .\nMoreover, on regional railway lines, many operators are unable to implement adequate\ninspections owing to problems such as cost and personnel constraints. Hence, low-cost monitoring systems have been developed based on on-board sensing devices and global navigation satellite system\n(GNSS) data. In this system, the sensing device is installed in an in-service vehicle to measure car-body vibrations. The diagnosis is performed by rating the track conditions based on the measurement data.\nPresently, however, the rating needs to be calculated manually. It is difficult to address a large volume of automatically collected data. To enable the efficient computational processing of collected data,In the present study, we adopted machine learning techniques and developed an algorithm to automatically diagnose track conditions from car-body vibrations to automatically detect track\nirregularities and identify them by type.

The results of the diagnosis are fed back to the infrastructure providers where they are used to help create maintenance plans, select work locations, and assign work priorities.Figure 2 shows a photograph of the compact on-board sensing device used in the track condition monitoring system . The device consists of an accelerometer and rate gyroscope for detecting\ntrack errors, a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver for detecting the train location and\nspeed, and a sensor interface for feeding the signals from the sensors to the computer.The system is battery-powered and conducts continuous measurements for up to six hours,\nand thus measurements are simply obtained by placing it in a car. Measurements are constantly obtained if it is powered by a source on the car. Measurement data are stored into an on-board storage device. Furthermore, the device is equipped with a function to automatically transmit measured data from the on-board storage device to a server via a mobile phone network. The device is further\nequipped with a microphone, and thus, it is also possible to “listen” for corrugation and diagnose either via a mobile phone network or via writing to external media. The diagnostic results produced\nchannels via smartphones or tablet computers. Railway operators use the information to establish the\ntrack maintenance priorities, and thereby facilitate the maintenance planning and work.\nAdditionally, the real-time measurement of vehicle vibrations during in-service operation allows for rapid response, such as emergency track inspection and maintenance, in situations in which vehicle\nvibration observations detect irregularly large deviations from standard control values. Thus, the use of deterioration or other track irregularities, and thereby enables infrastructure providers to conductTrack irregularity inspection includes vertical rail profile, lateral alignment, gauge, cross-level,\ntwist and dipped joint, and corrugation as shown in Figure 3. In the developed monitoring system,\nthe detection of track faults for vertical, lateral alignment, and cross-level is possible by usingof derailments. Thus, they are among the most important items that are monitored. Vehicle vibrations are strongly correlated with track irregularities, and thus the magnitude of vehicle vibrations is\nan effective means for assessing general track condition trends. Thus, sections of track over whichTo analyse the effects of railway track deterioration on car-body vibrations, we performed a railway vehicle travel simulation using SIMPACK, a multibody dynamics software package.\nThe model used for the simulation was a single conventional railway vehicle, the parameters for\nwhich are shown in Table 1. Figure 4 shows the model used in the simulation.The model consists of seven rigid bodies, one car body, two bogies, and four wheelsets,\neach having six degrees of freedom. Thus, 42 degrees of freedom exist in the model. It is necessary to connect each rigid body with an appropriate joint such that the vehicle exhibits a realistic motion.\nOne car-body, two bogies, and four wheelsets were connected by spring and damper elements.\nUsing this vehicle model, we calculated the vertical acceleration, lateral acceleration, and roll rate above the centre of the front bogie at the car body. This simulation study is carried out based on the\nstraight track. Alignment irregularity in curved track is not considered in this paper but should beTrack irregularities can be used as an index for managing track conditions. The types of\ntrack irregularities include longitudinal level irregularities that indicate vertical rail displacement,\nalignment irregularities that indicate lateral rail displacement, and cross level irregularities that indicate a difference in the elevation of the left and right rails. Because a high degree of correlation exists\nbetween these track irregularities and car-body vibrations, the magnitude of car-body vibrations can be an effective method to determine track conditions . The track-condition monitoring system can\nto detect any longitudinal level irregularities, alignment irregularities, and cross level irregularities.\nTo identify different types of track faults by using machine-learning techniques, it is necessary to extract the features of each type of track irregularity from the car-body vibrations that occur when travelling on a faulty track. The data obtained by learning the extracted features can be used to construct a training model. Subsequently, if unknown car-body vibration data are input to the model,\nthe type of track irregularity and its degradation level can be identified.\nAs shown in Figure 5, we created a baseline track geometry for an assumed regional railway line and a track geometry with increased track irregularities. We subsequently performed a travel\nsimulation by using a track for which all the longitudinal level irregularities, alignment irregularities,\nand cross level irregularities were within the normal range, and also by using a track for which one type of irregularity was abnormal. Degraded track is generated by the power spectral density of track\nwhere the standard deviation becomes twice as large as the normal track. The travelling distance wasThe acceleration root mean square (RMS) is closely linked to the general health of the running gear and track . Therefore, the acceleration RMS can be used as the primary index to predict the\ntrack condition. First, we need to obtain localised RMS values over short time intervals with a small window size to obtain the relationship between track condition and position. The RMS value may be### ∑ x j [,] (1)where xj is the measured vertical acceleration, lateral acceleration or roll angular velocity of car-body Track irregularities include longitudinal level irregularities, alignment irregularities, and cross\nlevel irregularities. In order to assess the irregularities, we determine the RMS values of vertical acceleration, lateral acceleration, and roll rate measured by the compact-sized on-board sensing device.be optimised based on the analysis of collected measurement data as the future work.\nFigure 6 shows the results of car-body vibration calculations, which indicate that longitudinal level and alignment irregularities influence the vertical and lateral accelerations, respectively, while cross level irregularities influence both the lateral acceleration and roll rate. The maximum RMS values for the vertical acceleration, lateral acceleration, and roll rate were calculated for each 10 m section.\nThe section length 10 m is decided based on the consideration of GNSS error.\nFigure 7 shows a feature space created by plotting these values in three dimensions. As shown,\nfour clusters are present, representing a normal track, and abnormal tracks with longitudinal level,\nalignment, and cross level irregularities. It is obvious that such a feature space could be used as\ntraining data for machine learning to enable track conditions to be identified.In this study, we used a support vector machine (SVM), which is a type of machine-learning algorithm created to solve two-class classification problems. An SVM identifies the most distant\npoints (“maximum margin”) between two groups and draws a boundary at the centre point between\nthem. A feature of the SVM is that maximising this separation (margin) results in a high degree of\ngeneralisation. Utilising the SVM, we classified track conditions by using the following procedure.First, we classify the obtained data into two classes, “faulty track with longitudinal-level irregularity” or “not.” Next, we classify the data into “faulty track with alignment irregularity”\nor “not.” Subsequently, we classify the data into “faulty track with cross-level irregularity” or “not.”\nFinally, if the data are not classified in the faulty data group, the track is diagnosed as normal. By using\nthe procedure above, the track is diagnosed for every 10 m section with the algorithm.\nWe have not considered for optimising parameters in SVM in this study, but it should beWe performed a vehicle travel simulation using SIMPACK and calculated the car-body vibration when the vehicle was traveling on tracks with different irregularities in some sections.

The validity of the detection was evaluated for every 100 faults of longitudinallevel, alignment, and cross level irregularities in 5000 m track lengths.

Thus, sections of track over whichTo analyse the effects of railway track deterioration on car-body vibrations, we performed a railway vehicle travel simulation using SIMPACK, a multibody dynamics software package.\nThe model used for the simulation was a single conventional railway vehicle, the parameters for\nwhich are shown in Table 1. Figure 4 shows the model used in the simulation.The model consists of seven rigid bodies, one car body, two bogies, and four wheelsets,\neach having six degrees of freedom. Thus, 42 degrees of freedom exist in the model. It is necessary to connect each rigid body with an appropriate joint such that the vehicle exhibits a realistic motion.\nOne car-body, two bogies, and four wheelsets were connected by spring and damper elements.\nUsing this vehicle model, we calculated the vertical acceleration, lateral acceleration, and roll rate above the centre of the front bogie at the car body. This simulation study is carried out based on the\nstraight track. Alignment irregularity in curved track is not considered in this paper but should beTrack irregularities can be used as an index for managing track conditions. The types of\ntrack irregularities include longitudinal level irregularities that indicate vertical rail displacement,\nalignment irregularities that indicate lateral rail displacement, and cross level irregularities that indicate a difference in the elevation of the left and right rails. Because a high degree of correlation exists\nbetween these track irregularities and car-body vibrations, the magnitude of car-body vibrations can be an effective method to determine track conditions . The track-condition monitoring system can\nto detect any longitudinal level irregularities, alignment irregularities, and cross level irregularities.\nTo identify different types of track faults by using machine-learning techniques, it is necessary to extract the features of each type of track irregularity from the car-body vibrations that occur when travelling on a faulty track. The data obtained by learning the extracted features can be used to construct a training model. Subsequently, if unknown car-body vibration data are input to the model,\nthe type of track irregularity and its degradation level can be identified.\nAs shown in Figure 5, we created a baseline track geometry for an assumed regional railway line and a track geometry with increased track irregularities. We subsequently performed a travel\nsimulation by using a track for which all the longitudinal level irregularities, alignment irregularities,\nand cross level irregularities were within the normal range, and also by using a track for which one type of irregularity was abnormal. Degraded track is generated by the power spectral density of track\nwhere the standard deviation becomes twice as large as the normal track. The travelling distance wasThe acceleration root mean square (RMS) is closely linked to the general health of the running gear and track . Therefore, the acceleration RMS can be used as the primary index to predict the\ntrack condition. First, we need to obtain localised RMS values over short time intervals with a small window size to obtain the relationship between track condition and position. The RMS value may be### ∑ x j [,] (1)where xj is the measured vertical acceleration, lateral acceleration or roll angular velocity of car-body Track irregularities include longitudinal level irregularities, alignment irregularities, and cross\nlevel irregularities. In order to assess the irregularities, we determine the RMS values of vertical acceleration, lateral acceleration, and roll rate measured by the compact-sized on-board sensing device.be optimised based on the analysis of collected measurement data as the future work.\nFigure 6 shows the results of car-body vibration calculations, which indicate that longitudinal level and alignment irregularities influence the vertical and lateral accelerations, respectively, while cross level irregularities influence both the lateral acceleration and roll rate. The maximum RMS values for the vertical acceleration, lateral acceleration, and roll rate were calculated for each 10 m section.\nThe section length 10 m is decided based on the consideration of GNSS error.\nFigure 7 shows a feature space created by plotting these values in three dimensions. As shown,\nfour clusters are present, representing a normal track, and abnormal tracks with longitudinal level,\nalignment, and cross level irregularities. It is obvious that such a feature space could be used as\ntraining data for machine learning to enable track conditions to be identified.In this study, we used a support vector machine (SVM), which is a type of machine-learning algorithm created to solve two-class classification problems. An SVM identifies the most distant\npoints (“maximum margin”) between two groups and draws a boundary at the centre point between\nthem. A feature of the SVM is that maximising this separation (margin) results in a high degree of\ngeneralisation. Utilising the SVM, we classified track conditions by using the following procedure.First, we classify the obtained data into two classes, “faulty track with longitudinal-level irregularity” or “not.” Next, we classify the data into “faulty track with alignment irregularity”\nor “not.” Subsequently, we classify the data into “faulty track with cross-level irregularity” or “not.”\nFinally, if the data are not classified in the faulty data group, the track is diagnosed as normal. By using\nthe procedure above, the track is diagnosed for every 10 m section with the algorithm.\nWe have not considered for optimising parameters in SVM in this study, but it should beWe performed a vehicle travel simulation using SIMPACK and calculated the car-body vibration when the vehicle was traveling on tracks with different irregularities in some sections. The obtained\nThe track geometry used for the simulation differed from that shown in Figure 8. The track faults were modelled by increasing the reference track irregularities by factors of 1. and 2. times and added to the reference track geometry. Figure 9 shows the modelled track faults. The track geometry used in the simulation was generated by adding the track fault in Figure 8 to the reference track geometry.\nThe total length of the track geometry was 5000 m. Furthermore, 100 faults of longitudinal level,\nalignment, and cross level irregularities were randamly provided in different places.**Figure 9.** Degraded track geometry in some sections. ( **a** ) Longitudinal level geometry. ( **b** ) AlignmentFigure 10 shows the calculation result of the car-body vibrations when a vehicle travels the track geometry shown in Figure 9. As shown in Figure 10, only the vertical or lateral acceleration increases\nwhen the longitudinal level irregularity or the alignment irregularity increase. As shown, both the\nlateral acceleration and roll rate increase when the cross level irregularity increases.**Figure 10.** Calculated car-body vibration by using Figure 9. ( **a** ) Vertical acceleration. ( **b** ) Lateralthe simulated car-body vibration data. For the training data, we used the feature space as shown in Figure 6. The detection results were divided into four classes: normal track, faulty track\nwith longitudinal-level irregularity, faulty track with alignment irregularity, and faulty track with cross-level irregularity. The validity of the detection was evaluated for every 100 faults of longitudinallevel, alignment, and cross level irregularities in 5000 m track lengths. Figure 11 shows the results ofAs shown in Figure 11, the developed algorithm detected the track fault with an accuracy of 80 percent or more for normal and highly degraded tracks. Clearly, the longitudinal level\nirregularity can be detected with high accuracy for normal, intermediate, and highly degraded tracks.\nMeanwhile, the detection accuracy of the alignment and cross level irregularities are lower than that for the longitudinal level irregularity, especially for the intermediately degraded track. However, it is\nnoted that most of the track faults in the regional railway are longitudinal level irregularities.\nTherefore, the developed diagnosis algorithm is considered effective for regional railway lines.\nThe effect of vehicle faults such as wheel flat will appear on the car-body vibration. It is possible to identify the possibility of the faulty train by looking at the measurement data of different places.As an initial test of track fault detection using machine learning, we created clusters of simple features from the car-body vibration data for a regional railway line. To measure the vibration, we used\nan on-board sensing device comprising an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and a GNSS receiver as shown**Figure 12.** Measurement of car-body vibration in a regional railway line.The training data were measured in January, February, May, June, July, and November 2016 for\nsections of the line where repairs for longitudinal level irregularities were performed in October 2016.\nClusters of abnormal track data were created based on the following conditions:• Longitudinal level irregularity: vertical acceleration ≥ 1. m/s• Alignment irregularity: lateral acceleration ≥ 1. m/s and roll rate ≤ 0. rad/sFigure 13 shows the feature space of car-body vibration in a regional railway line. The normal cluster was constructed from car-body vibration data measured in November 2016, immediately after\nlongitudinal level irregularities were repaired. The algorithm detects the location and type of track fault for every 10 m of track. Using the diagnosis algorithm, we diagnosed the track condition in**Figure 13.** Feature space of car-body vibration in a regional railway line.Figure 14 shows the measured RMS values for the car-body vibrations and the results obtained by the detection algorithm (colour map in the upper part of each figure).

The results indicated that combined faults can be detected by the developed algorithm. Therefore, we can conclude**Figure 14.** Detection results for regional railway line.

This, in turn, has spurred the interest in using this type of monitoring\nto create maintenance plans or schedule condition-based maintenance when the track conditions The condition of railway tracks is an important factor in ensuring the safe operation of trains.\nTo ensure that railway travel is safe and comfortable, it is necessary to maintain and manage tracks properly; this includes preventive maintenance. Further, it is desirable to monitor tracks frequently.\nThe deformations that occur in tracks, referred to as track irregularities, are closely connected to the riding quality and safety of railway vehicles.

Additionally, recent studies proposed employing a Kalman filter to predict track\nirregularities from the acceleration measurements of car-body vibrations of railway vehicles .\nMoreover, on regional railway lines, many operators are unable to implement adequate\ninspections owing to problems such as cost and personnel constraints. Hence, low-cost monitoring systems have been developed based on on-board sensing devices and global navigation satellite system\n(GNSS) data. In this system, the sensing device is installed in an in-service vehicle to measure car-body vibrations. The diagnosis is performed by rating the track conditions based on the measurement data.\nPresently, however, the rating needs to be calculated manually. It is difficult to address a large volume of automatically collected data. To enable the efficient computational processing of collected data,In the present study, we adopted machine learning techniques and developed an algorithm to automatically diagnose track conditions from car-body vibrations to automatically detect track\nirregularities and identify them by type. We subsequently performed a simulation to verify the effectiveness of the developed algorithm. In addition, we examined the possibility of diagnosing trackThe monitoring of railway track geometry from an in-service vehicle became increasingly\nattractive over the past decade . Track geometry measurement systems using in-service vehicles have been developed worldwide, although they are still in the developing stage. The repeated verification\nof the same track provides an opportunity to record track geometry degradation. The obtained information is fed back to the track maintenance section to implement necessary steps.\nSeveral types of track faults are detected by measuring the acceleration of bogies. Weston et al.\ndemonstrated track irregularity monitoring by using bogie-mounted sensors . Alfi et al. proposed a technique to estimate long wavelength track irregularities from on-board measurements . If track\nfaults are detected using car-body mounted sensors, it is easier to perform the condition monitoring of track irregularities. The distinctive signal of track faults is hidden in car-body vibrations, and thus\nsignal processing of the acceleration measured in-cabin is necessary to detect the track faults.\nTsunashima et al. demonstrated the possibility of estimating the track geometry of Shinkansen tracks using only car-body motions .

The results of the diagnosis are fed back to the infrastructure providers where they are used to help create maintenance plans, select work locations, and assign work priorities.Figure 2 shows a photograph of the compact on-board sensing device used in the track condition monitoring system . The device consists of an accelerometer and rate gyroscope for detecting\ntrack errors, a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver for detecting the train location and\nspeed, and a sensor interface for feeding the signals from the sensors to the computer.The system is battery-powered and conducts continuous measurements for up to six hours,\nand thus measurements are simply obtained by placing it in a car. Measurements are constantly obtained if it is powered by a source on the car. Measurement data are stored into an on-board storage device. Furthermore, the device is equipped with a function to automatically transmit measured data from the on-board storage device to a server via a mobile phone network. The device is further\nequipped with a microphone, and thus, it is also possible to “listen” for corrugation and diagnose either via a mobile phone network or via writing to external media.

In this system, the sensing device is installed in an in-service vehicle to measure car-body vibrations. The diagnosis is performed by rating the track conditions based on the measurement data.\nPresently, however, the rating needs to be calculated manually. It is difficult to address a large volume of automatically collected data. To enable the efficient computational processing of collected data,In the present study, we adopted machine learning techniques and developed an algorithm to automatically diagnose track conditions from car-body vibrations to automatically detect track\nirregularities and identify them by type. We subsequently performed a simulation to verify the effectiveness of the developed algorithm. In addition, we examined the possibility of diagnosing trackThe monitoring of railway track geometry from an in-service vehicle became increasingly\nattractive over the past decade . Track geometry measurement systems using in-service vehicles have been developed worldwide, although they are still in the developing stage. The repeated verification\nof the same track provides an opportunity to record track geometry degradation. The obtained information is fed back to the track maintenance section to implement necessary steps.\nSeveral types of track faults are detected by measuring the acceleration of bogies. Weston et al.\ndemonstrated track irregularity monitoring by using bogie-mounted sensors . Alfi et al. proposed a technique to estimate long wavelength track irregularities from on-board measurements .

The results of the diagnosis are fed back to the infrastructure providers where they are used to help create maintenance plans, select work locations, and assign work priorities.Figure 2 shows a photograph of the compact on-board sensing device used in the track condition monitoring system . The device consists of an accelerometer and rate gyroscope for detecting\ntrack errors, a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver for detecting the train location and\nspeed, and a sensor interface for feeding the signals from the sensors to the computer.The system is battery-powered and conducts continuous measurements for up to six hours,\nand thus measurements are simply obtained by placing it in a car. Measurements are constantly obtained if it is powered by a source on the car. Measurement data are stored into an on-board storage device. Furthermore, the device is equipped with a function to automatically transmit measured data from the on-board storage device to a server via a mobile phone network. The device is further\nequipped with a microphone, and thus, it is also possible to “listen” for corrugation and diagnose either via a mobile phone network or via writing to external media. The diagnostic results produced\nchannels via smartphones or tablet computers. Railway operators use the information to establish the\ntrack maintenance priorities, and thereby facilitate the maintenance planning and work.\nAdditionally, the real-time measurement of vehicle vibrations during in-service operation allows for rapid response, such as emergency track inspection and maintenance, in situations in which vehicle\nvibration observations detect irregularly large deviations from standard control values. Thus, the use of deterioration or other track irregularities, and thereby enables infrastructure providers to conductTrack irregularity inspection includes vertical rail profile, lateral alignment, gauge, cross-level,\ntwist and dipped joint, and corrugation as shown in Figure 3. In the developed monitoring system,\nthe detection of track faults for vertical, lateral alignment, and cross-level is possible by usingof derailments. Thus, they are among the most important items that are monitored. Vehicle vibrations are strongly correlated with track irregularities, and thus the magnitude of vehicle vibrations is\nan effective means for assessing general track condition trends. Thus, sections of track over whichTo analyse the effects of railway track deterioration on car-body vibrations, we performed a railway vehicle travel simulation using SIMPACK, a multibody dynamics software package.\nThe model used for the simulation was a single conventional railway vehicle, the parameters for\nwhich are shown in Table 1. Figure 4 shows the model used in the simulation.The model consists of seven rigid bodies, one car body, two bogies, and four wheelsets,\neach having six degrees of freedom. Thus, 42 degrees of freedom exist in the model. It is necessary to connect each rigid body with an appropriate joint such that the vehicle exhibits a realistic motion.\nOne car-body, two bogies, and four wheelsets were connected by spring and damper elements.\nUsing this vehicle model, we calculated the vertical acceleration, lateral acceleration, and roll rate above the centre of the front bogie at the car body. This simulation study is carried out based on the\nstraight track. Alignment irregularity in curved track is not considered in this paper but should beTrack irregularities can be used as an index for managing track conditions. The types of\ntrack irregularities include longitudinal level irregularities that indicate vertical rail displacement,\nalignment irregularities that indicate lateral rail displacement, and cross level irregularities that indicate a difference in the elevation of the left and right rails. Because a high degree of correlation exists\nbetween these track irregularities and car-body vibrations, the magnitude of car-body vibrations can be an effective method to determine track conditions . The track-condition monitoring system can\nto detect any longitudinal level irregularities, alignment irregularities, and cross level irregularities.\nTo identify different types of track faults by using machine-learning techniques, it is necessary to extract the features of each type of track irregularity from the car-body vibrations that occur when travelling on a faulty track. The data obtained by learning the extracted features can be used to construct a training model. Subsequently, if unknown car-body vibration data are input to the model,\nthe type of track irregularity and its degradation level can be identified.\nAs shown in Figure 5, we created a baseline track geometry for an assumed regional railway line and a track geometry with increased track irregularities. We subsequently performed a travel\nsimulation by using a track for which all the longitudinal level irregularities, alignment irregularities,\nand cross level irregularities were within the normal range, and also by using a track for which one type of irregularity was abnormal. Degraded track is generated by the power spectral density of track\nwhere the standard deviation becomes twice as large as the normal track. The travelling distance wasThe acceleration root mean square (RMS) is closely linked to the general health of the running gear and track . Therefore, the acceleration RMS can be used as the primary index to predict the\ntrack condition. First, we need to obtain localised RMS values over short time intervals with a small window size to obtain the relationship between track condition and position. The RMS value may be### ∑ x j [,] (1)where xj is the measured vertical acceleration, lateral acceleration or roll angular velocity of car-body Track irregularities include longitudinal level irregularities, alignment irregularities, and cross\nlevel irregularities. In order to assess the irregularities, we determine the RMS values of vertical acceleration, lateral acceleration, and roll rate measured by the compact-sized on-board sensing device.be optimised based on the analysis of collected measurement data as the future work.\nFigure 6 shows the results of car-body vibration calculations, which indicate that longitudinal level and alignment irregularities influence the vertical and lateral accelerations, respectively, while cross level irregularities influence both the lateral acceleration and roll rate. The maximum RMS values for the vertical acceleration, lateral acceleration, and roll rate were calculated for each 10 m section.\nThe section length 10 m is decided based on the consideration of GNSS error.\nFigure 7 shows a feature space created by plotting these values in three dimensions. As shown,\nfour clusters are present, representing a normal track, and abnormal tracks with longitudinal level,\nalignment, and cross level irregularities. It is obvious that such a feature space could be used as\ntraining data for machine learning to enable track conditions to be identified.In this study, we used a support vector machine (SVM), which is a type of machine-learning algorithm created to solve two-class classification problems. An SVM identifies the most distant\npoints (“maximum margin”) between two groups and draws a boundary at the centre point between\nthem. A feature of the SVM is that maximising this separation (margin) results in a high degree of\ngeneralisation. Utilising the SVM, we classified track conditions by using the following procedure.First, we classify the obtained data into two classes, “faulty track with longitudinal-level irregularity” or “not.” Next, we classify the data into “faulty track with alignment irregularity”\nor “not.” Subsequently, we classify the data into “faulty track with cross-level irregularity” or “not.”\nFinally, if the data are not classified in the faulty data group, the track is diagnosed as normal. By using\nthe procedure above, the track is diagnosed for every 10 m section with the algorithm.\nWe have not considered for optimising parameters in SVM in this study, but it should beWe performed a vehicle travel simulation using SIMPACK and calculated the car-body vibration when the vehicle was traveling on tracks with different irregularities in some sections. The obtained\nThe track geometry used for the simulation differed from that shown in Figure 8. The track faults were modelled by increasing the reference track irregularities by factors of 1. and 2. times and added to the reference track geometry. Figure 9 shows the modelled track faults. The track geometry used in the simulation was generated by adding the track fault in Figure 8 to the reference track geometry.\nThe total length of the track geometry was 5000 m. Furthermore, 100 faults of longitudinal level,\nalignment, and cross level irregularities were randamly provided in different places.**Figure 9.** Degraded track geometry in some sections. ( **a** ) Longitudinal level geometry. ( **b** ) AlignmentFigure 10 shows the calculation result of the car-body vibrations when a vehicle travels the track geometry shown in Figure 9. As shown in Figure 10, only the vertical or lateral acceleration increases\nwhen the longitudinal level irregularity or the alignment irregularity increase. As shown, both the\nlateral acceleration and roll rate increase when the cross level irregularity increases.**Figure 10.** Calculated car-body vibration by using Figure 9. ( **a** ) Vertical acceleration. ( **b** ) Lateralthe simulated car-body vibration data. For the training data, we used the feature space as shown in Figure 6. The detection results were divided into four classes: normal track, faulty track\nwith longitudinal-level irregularity, faulty track with alignment irregularity, and faulty track with cross-level irregularity. The validity of the detection was evaluated for every 100 faults of longitudinallevel, alignment, and cross level irregularities in 5000 m track lengths. Figure 11 shows the results ofAs shown in Figure 11, the developed algorithm detected the track fault with an accuracy of 80 percent or more for normal and highly degraded tracks. Clearly, the longitudinal level\nirregularity can be detected with high accuracy for normal, intermediate, and highly degraded tracks.\nMeanwhile, the detection accuracy of the alignment and cross level irregularities are lower than that for the longitudinal level irregularity, especially for the intermediately degraded track. However, it is\nnoted that most of the track faults in the regional railway are longitudinal level irregularities.\nTherefore, the developed diagnosis algorithm is considered effective for regional railway lines.\nThe effect of vehicle faults such as wheel flat will appear on the car-body vibration. It is possible to identify the possibility of the faulty train by looking at the measurement data of different places.As an initial test of track fault detection using machine learning, we created clusters of simple features from the car-body vibration data for a regional railway line. To measure the vibration, we used\nan on-board sensing device comprising an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and a GNSS receiver as shown**Figure 12.** Measurement of car-body vibration in a regional railway line.The training data were measured in January, February, May, June, July, and November 2016 for\nsections of the line where repairs for longitudinal level irregularities were performed in October 2016.\nClusters of abnormal track data were created based on the following conditions:• Longitudinal level irregularity: vertical acceleration ≥ 1. m/s• Alignment irregularity: lateral acceleration ≥ 1. m/s and roll rate ≤ 0. rad/sFigure 13 shows the feature space of car-body vibration in a regional railway line. The normal cluster was constructed from car-body vibration data measured in November 2016, immediately after\nlongitudinal level irregularities were repaired. The algorithm detects the location and type of track fault for every 10 m of track. Using the diagnosis algorithm, we diagnosed the track condition in**Figure 13.** Feature space of car-body vibration in a regional railway line.Figure 14 shows the measured RMS values for the car-body vibrations and the results obtained by the detection algorithm (colour map in the upper part of each figure).

Additionally, recent studies proposed employing a Kalman filter to predict track\nirregularities from the acceleration measurements of car-body vibrations of railway vehicles .\nMoreover, on regional railway lines, many operators are unable to implement adequate\ninspections owing to problems such as cost and personnel constraints. Hence, low-cost monitoring systems have been developed based on on-board sensing devices and global navigation satellite system\n(GNSS) data. In this system, the sensing device is installed in an in-service vehicle to measure car-body vibrations. The diagnosis is performed by rating the track conditions based on the measurement data.\nPresently, however, the rating needs to be calculated manually. It is difficult to address a large volume of automatically collected data. To enable the efficient computational processing of collected data,In the present study, we adopted machine learning techniques and developed an algorithm to automatically diagnose track conditions from car-body vibrations to automatically detect track\nirregularities and identify them by type. We subsequently performed a simulation to verify the effectiveness of the developed algorithm. In addition, we examined the possibility of diagnosing trackThe monitoring of railway track geometry from an in-service vehicle became increasingly\nattractive over the past decade . Track geometry measurement systems using in-service vehicles have been developed worldwide, although they are still in the developing stage. The repeated verification\nof the same track provides an opportunity to record track geometry degradation. The obtained information is fed back to the track maintenance section to implement necessary steps.\nSeveral types of track faults are detected by measuring the acceleration of bogies.

The results of the diagnosis are fed back to the infrastructure providers where they are used to help create maintenance plans, select work locations, and assign work priorities.Figure 2 shows a photograph of the compact on-board sensing device used in the track condition monitoring system . The device consists of an accelerometer and rate gyroscope for detecting\ntrack errors, a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver for detecting the train location and\nspeed, and a sensor interface for feeding the signals from the sensors to the computer.The system is battery-powered and conducts continuous measurements for up to six hours,\nand thus measurements are simply obtained by placing it in a car. Measurements are constantly obtained if it is powered by a source on the car. Measurement data are stored into an on-board storage device. Furthermore, the device is equipped with a function to automatically transmit measured data from the on-board storage device to a server via a mobile phone network. The device is further\nequipped with a microphone, and thus, it is also possible to “listen” for corrugation and diagnose either via a mobile phone network or via writing to external media. The diagnostic results produced\nchannels via smartphones or tablet computers. Railway operators use the information to establish the\ntrack maintenance priorities, and thereby facilitate the maintenance planning and work.\nAdditionally, the real-time measurement of vehicle vibrations during in-service operation allows for rapid response, such as emergency track inspection and maintenance, in situations in which vehicle\nvibration observations detect irregularly large deviations from standard control values. Thus, the use of deterioration or other track irregularities, and thereby enables infrastructure providers to conductTrack irregularity inspection includes vertical rail profile, lateral alignment, gauge, cross-level,\ntwist and dipped joint, and corrugation as shown in Figure 3. In the developed monitoring system,\nthe detection of track faults for vertical, lateral alignment, and cross-level is possible by usingof derailments. Thus, they are among the most important items that are monitored. Vehicle vibrations are strongly correlated with track irregularities, and thus the magnitude of vehicle vibrations is\nan effective means for assessing general track condition trends. Thus, sections of track over whichTo analyse the effects of railway track deterioration on car-body vibrations, we performed a railway vehicle travel simulation using SIMPACK, a multibody dynamics software package.\nThe model used for the simulation was a single conventional railway vehicle, the parameters for\nwhich are shown in Table 1. Figure 4 shows the model used in the simulation.The model consists of seven rigid bodies, one car body, two bogies, and four wheelsets,\neach having six degrees of freedom. Thus, 42 degrees of freedom exist in the model. It is necessary to connect each rigid body with an appropriate joint such that the vehicle exhibits a realistic motion.\nOne car-body, two bogies, and four wheelsets were connected by spring and damper elements.\nUsing this vehicle model, we calculated the vertical acceleration, lateral acceleration, and roll rate above the centre of the front bogie at the car body. This simulation study is carried out based on the\nstraight track. Alignment irregularity in curved track is not considered in this paper but should beTrack irregularities can be used as an index for managing track conditions. The types of\ntrack irregularities include longitudinal level irregularities that indicate vertical rail displacement,\nalignment irregularities that indicate lateral rail displacement, and cross level irregularities that indicate a difference in the elevation of the left and right rails. Because a high degree of correlation exists\nbetween these track irregularities and car-body vibrations, the magnitude of car-body vibrations can be an effective method to determine track conditions . The track-condition monitoring system can\nto detect any longitudinal level irregularities, alignment irregularities, and cross level irregularities.\nTo identify different types of track faults by using machine-learning techniques, it is necessary to extract the features of each type of track irregularity from the car-body vibrations that occur when travelling on a faulty track. The data obtained by learning the extracted features can be used to construct a training model. Subsequently, if unknown car-body vibration data are input to the model,\nthe type of track irregularity and its degradation level can be identified.\nAs shown in Figure 5, we created a baseline track geometry for an assumed regional railway line and a track geometry with increased track irregularities. We subsequently performed a travel\nsimulation by using a track for which all the longitudinal level irregularities, alignment irregularities,\nand cross level irregularities were within the normal range, and also by using a track for which one type of irregularity was abnormal.

The travelling distance wasThe acceleration root mean square (RMS) is closely linked to the general health of the running gear and track . Therefore, the acceleration RMS can be used as the primary index to predict the\ntrack condition. First, we need to obtain localised RMS values over short time intervals with a small window size to obtain the relationship between track condition and position. The RMS value may be### ∑ x j [,] (1)where xj is the measured vertical acceleration, lateral acceleration or roll angular velocity of car-body Track irregularities include longitudinal level irregularities, alignment irregularities, and cross\nlevel irregularities. In order to assess the irregularities, we determine the RMS values of vertical acceleration, lateral acceleration, and roll rate measured by the compact-sized on-board sensing device.be optimised based on the analysis of collected measurement data as the future work.\nFigure 6 shows the results of car-body vibration calculations, which indicate that longitudinal level and alignment irregularities influence the vertical and lateral accelerations, respectively, while cross level irregularities influence both the lateral acceleration and roll rate. The maximum RMS values for the vertical acceleration, lateral acceleration, and roll rate were calculated for each 10 m section.\nThe section length 10 m is decided based on the consideration of GNSS error.\nFigure 7 shows a feature space created by plotting these values in three dimensions. As shown,\nfour clusters are present, representing a normal track, and abnormal tracks with longitudinal level,\nalignment, and cross level irregularities. It is obvious that such a feature space could be used as\ntraining data for machine learning to enable track conditions to be identified.In this study, we used a support vector machine (SVM), which is a type of machine-learning algorithm created to solve two-class classification problems. An SVM identifies the most distant\npoints (“maximum margin”) between two groups and draws a boundary at the centre point between\nthem. A feature of the SVM is that maximising this separation (margin) results in a high degree of\ngeneralisation. Utilising the SVM, we classified track conditions by using the following procedure.First, we classify the obtained data into two classes, “faulty track with longitudinal-level irregularity” or “not.” Next, we classify the data into “faulty track with alignment irregularity”\nor “not.” Subsequently, we classify the data into “faulty track with cross-level irregularity” or “not.”\nFinally, if the data are not classified in the faulty data group, the track is diagnosed as normal. By using\nthe procedure above, the track is diagnosed for every 10 m section with the algorithm.\nWe have not considered for optimising parameters in SVM in this study, but it should beWe performed a vehicle travel simulation using SIMPACK and calculated the car-body vibration when the vehicle was traveling on tracks with different irregularities in some sections. The obtained\nThe track geometry used for the simulation differed from that shown in Figure 8. The track faults were modelled by increasing the reference track irregularities by factors of 1. and 2. times and added to the reference track geometry. Figure 9 shows the modelled track faults. The track geometry used in the simulation was generated by adding the track fault in Figure 8 to the reference track geometry.\nThe total length of the track geometry was 5000 m. Furthermore, 100 faults of longitudinal level,\nalignment, and cross level irregularities were randamly provided in different places.**Figure 9.** Degraded track geometry in some sections. ( **a** ) Longitudinal level geometry. ( **b** ) AlignmentFigure 10 shows the calculation result of the car-body vibrations when a vehicle travels the track geometry shown in Figure 9. As shown in Figure 10, only the vertical or lateral acceleration increases\nwhen the longitudinal level irregularity or the alignment irregularity increase. As shown, both the\nlateral acceleration and roll rate increase when the cross level irregularity increases.**Figure 10.** Calculated car-body vibration by using Figure 9. ( **a** ) Vertical acceleration. ( **b** ) Lateralthe simulated car-body vibration data. For the training data, we used the feature space as shown in Figure 6. The detection results were divided into four classes: normal track, faulty track\nwith longitudinal-level irregularity, faulty track with alignment irregularity, and faulty track with cross-level irregularity. The validity of the detection was evaluated for every 100 faults of longitudinallevel, alignment, and cross level irregularities in 5000 m track lengths. Figure 11 shows the results ofAs shown in Figure 11, the developed algorithm detected the track fault with an accuracy of 80 percent or more for normal and highly degraded tracks. Clearly, the longitudinal level\nirregularity can be detected with high accuracy for normal, intermediate, and highly degraded tracks.\nMeanwhile, the detection accuracy of the alignment and cross level irregularities are lower than that for the longitudinal level irregularity, especially for the intermediately degraded track. However, it is\nnoted that most of the track faults in the regional railway are longitudinal level irregularities.\nTherefore, the developed diagnosis algorithm is considered effective for regional railway lines.\nThe effect of vehicle faults such as wheel flat will appear on the car-body vibration. It is possible to identify the possibility of the faulty train by looking at the measurement data of different places.As an initial test of track fault detection using machine learning, we created clusters of simple features from the car-body vibration data for a regional railway line. To measure the vibration, we used\nan on-board sensing device comprising an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and a GNSS receiver as shown**Figure 12.** Measurement of car-body vibration in a regional railway line.The training data were measured in January, February, May, June, July, and November 2016 for\nsections of the line where repairs for longitudinal level irregularities were performed in October 2016.\nClusters of abnormal track data were created based on the following conditions:• Longitudinal level irregularity: vertical acceleration ≥ 1. m/s• Alignment irregularity: lateral acceleration ≥ 1. m/s and roll rate ≤ 0. rad/sFigure 13 shows the feature space of car-body vibration in a regional railway line. The normal cluster was constructed from car-body vibration data measured in November 2016, immediately after\nlongitudinal level irregularities were repaired. The algorithm detects the location and type of track fault for every 10 m of track. Using the diagnosis algorithm, we diagnosed the track condition in**Figure 13.** Feature space of car-body vibration in a regional railway line.Figure 14 shows the measured RMS values for the car-body vibrations and the results obtained by the detection algorithm (colour map in the upper part of each figure). Locations where the RMS\nvalues for vertical acceleration, lateral acceleration, and roll rate are large are successfully diagnosed\nas longitudinal level, alignment, and cross level irregularities, respectively.\nAs shown, multiple track faults were detected in location from 25. km to 25. km. The results indicated that combined faults can be detected by the developed algorithm. Therefore, we can conclude**Figure 14.** Detection results for regional railway line.

Figure 11 shows the results ofAs shown in Figure 11, the developed algorithm detected the track fault with an accuracy of 80 percent or more for normal and highly degraded tracks. Clearly, the longitudinal level\nirregularity can be detected with high accuracy for normal, intermediate, and highly degraded tracks.\nMeanwhile, the detection accuracy of the alignment and cross level irregularities are lower than that for the longitudinal level irregularity, especially for the intermediately degraded track. However, it is\nnoted that most of the track faults in the regional railway are longitudinal level irregularities.\nTherefore, the developed diagnosis algorithm is considered effective for regional railway lines.\nThe effect of vehicle faults such as wheel flat will appear on the car-body vibration. It is possible to identify the possibility of the faulty train by looking at the measurement data of different places.As an initial test of track fault detection using machine learning, we created clusters of simple features from the car-body vibration data for a regional railway line. To measure the vibration, we used\nan on-board sensing device comprising an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and a GNSS receiver as shown**Figure 12.** Measurement of car-body vibration in a regional railway line.The training data were measured in January, February, May, June, July, and November 2016 for\nsections of the line where repairs for longitudinal level irregularities were performed in October 2016.\nClusters of abnormal track data were created based on the following conditions:• Longitudinal level irregularity: vertical acceleration ≥ 1. m/s• Alignment irregularity: lateral acceleration ≥ 1. m/s and roll rate ≤ 0. rad/sFigure 13 shows the feature space of car-body vibration in a regional railway line.

The algorithm detects the location and type of track fault for every 10 m of track. Using the diagnosis algorithm, we diagnosed the track condition in**Figure 13.** Feature space of car-body vibration in a regional railway line.Figure 14 shows the measured RMS values for the car-body vibrations and the results obtained by the detection algorithm (colour map in the upper part of each figure).

Further, it is desirable to monitor tracks frequently.\nThe deformations that occur in tracks, referred to as track irregularities, are closely connected to the riding quality and safety of railway vehicles.

Additionally, recent studies proposed employing a Kalman filter to predict track\nirregularities from the acceleration measurements of car-body vibrations of railway vehicles .\nMoreover, on regional railway lines, many operators are unable to implement adequate\ninspections owing to problems such as cost and personnel constraints. Hence, low-cost monitoring systems have been developed based on on-board sensing devices and global navigation satellite system\n(GNSS) data. In this system, the sensing device is installed in an in-service vehicle to measure car-body vibrations. The diagnosis is performed by rating the track conditions based on the measurement data.\nPresently, however, the rating needs to be calculated manually. It is difficult to address a large volume of automatically collected data. To enable the efficient computational processing of collected data,In the present study, we adopted machine learning techniques and developed an algorithm to automatically diagnose track conditions from car-body vibrations to automatically detect track\nirregularities and identify them by type. We subsequently performed a simulation to verify the effectiveness of the developed algorithm. In addition, we examined the possibility of diagnosing trackThe monitoring of railway track geometry from an in-service vehicle became increasingly\nattractive over the past decade . Track geometry measurement systems using in-service vehicles have been developed worldwide, although they are still in the developing stage. The repeated verification\nof the same track provides an opportunity to record track geometry degradation. The obtained information is fed back to the track maintenance section to implement necessary steps.\nSeveral types of track faults are detected by measuring the acceleration of bogies.

The results of the diagnosis are fed back to the infrastructure providers where they are used to help create maintenance plans, select work locations, and assign work priorities.Figure 2 shows a photograph of the compact on-board sensing device used in the track condition monitoring system . The device consists of an accelerometer and rate gyroscope for detecting\ntrack errors, a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver for detecting the train location and\nspeed, and a sensor interface for feeding the signals from the sensors to the computer.The system is battery-powered and conducts continuous measurements for up to six hours,\nand thus measurements are simply obtained by placing it in a car. Measurements are constantly obtained if it is powered by a source on the car. Measurement data are stored into an on-board storage device. Furthermore, the device is equipped with a function to automatically transmit measured data from the on-board storage device to a server via a mobile phone network. The device is further\nequipped with a microphone, and thus, it is also possible to “listen” for corrugation and diagnose either via a mobile phone network or via writing to external media. The diagnostic results produced\nchannels via smartphones or tablet computers. Railway operators use the information to establish the\ntrack maintenance priorities, and thereby facilitate the maintenance planning and work.\nAdditionally, the real-time measurement of vehicle vibrations during in-service operation allows for rapid response, such as emergency track inspection and maintenance, in situations in which vehicle\nvibration observations detect irregularly large deviations from standard control values. Thus, the use of deterioration or other track irregularities, and thereby enables infrastructure providers to conductTrack irregularity inspection includes vertical rail profile, lateral alignment, gauge, cross-level,\ntwist and dipped joint, and corrugation as shown in Figure 3. In the developed monitoring system,\nthe detection of track faults for vertical, lateral alignment, and cross-level is possible by usingof derailments. Thus, they are among the most important items that are monitored. Vehicle vibrations are strongly correlated with track irregularities, and thus the magnitude of vehicle vibrations is\nan effective means for assessing general track condition trends. Thus, sections of track over whichTo analyse the effects of railway track deterioration on car-body vibrations, we performed a railway vehicle travel simulation using SIMPACK, a multibody dynamics software package.\nThe model used for the simulation was a single conventional railway vehicle, the parameters for\nwhich are shown in Table 1. Figure 4 shows the model used in the simulation.The model consists of seven rigid bodies, one car body, two bogies, and four wheelsets,\neach having six degrees of freedom. Thus, 42 degrees of freedom exist in the model. It is necessary to connect each rigid body with an appropriate joint such that the vehicle exhibits a realistic motion.\nOne car-body, two bogies, and four wheelsets were connected by spring and damper elements.\nUsing this vehicle model, we calculated the vertical acceleration, lateral acceleration, and roll rate above the centre of the front bogie at the car body. This simulation study is carried out based on the\nstraight track. Alignment irregularity in curved track is not considered in this paper but should beTrack irregularities can be used as an index for managing track conditions. The types of\ntrack irregularities include longitudinal level irregularities that indicate vertical rail displacement,\nalignment irregularities that indicate lateral rail displacement, and cross level irregularities that indicate a difference in the elevation of the left and right rails. Because a high degree of correlation exists\nbetween these track irregularities and car-body vibrations, the magnitude of car-body vibrations can be an effective method to determine track conditions . The track-condition monitoring system can\nto detect any longitudinal level irregularities, alignment irregularities, and cross level irregularities.\nTo identify different types of track faults by using machine-learning techniques, it is necessary to extract the features of each type of track irregularity from the car-body vibrations that occur when travelling on a faulty track. The data obtained by learning the extracted features can be used to construct a training model. Subsequently, if unknown car-body vibration data are input to the model,\nthe type of track irregularity and its degradation level can be identified.\nAs shown in Figure 5, we created a baseline track geometry for an assumed regional railway line and a track geometry with increased track irregularities. We subsequently performed a travel\nsimulation by using a track for which all the longitudinal level irregularities, alignment irregularities,\nand cross level irregularities were within the normal range, and also by using a track for which one type of irregularity was abnormal. Degraded track is generated by the power spectral density of track\nwhere the standard deviation becomes twice as large as the normal track. The travelling distance wasThe acceleration root mean square (RMS) is closely linked to the general health of the running gear and track . Therefore, the acceleration RMS can be used as the primary index to predict the\ntrack condition. First, we need to obtain localised RMS values over short time intervals with a small window size to obtain the relationship between track condition and position. The RMS value may be### ∑ x j [,] (1)where xj is the measured vertical acceleration, lateral acceleration or roll angular velocity of car-body Track irregularities include longitudinal level irregularities, alignment irregularities, and cross\nlevel irregularities. In order to assess the irregularities, we determine the RMS values of vertical acceleration, lateral acceleration, and roll rate measured by the compact-sized on-board sensing device.be optimised based on the analysis of collected measurement data as the future work.\nFigure 6 shows the results of car-body vibration calculations, which indicate that longitudinal level and alignment irregularities influence the vertical and lateral accelerations, respectively, while cross level irregularities influence both the lateral acceleration and roll rate. The maximum RMS values for the vertical acceleration, lateral acceleration, and roll rate were calculated for each 10 m section.\nThe section length 10 m is decided based on the consideration of GNSS error.\nFigure 7 shows a feature space created by plotting these values in three dimensions. As shown,\nfour clusters are present, representing a normal track, and abnormal tracks with longitudinal level,\nalignment, and cross level irregularities. It is obvious that such a feature space could be used as\ntraining data for machine learning to enable track conditions to be identified.In this study, we used a support vector machine (SVM), which is a type of machine-learning algorithm created to solve two-class classification problems. An SVM identifies the most distant\npoints (“maximum margin”) between two groups and draws a boundary at the centre point between\nthem. A feature of the SVM is that maximising this separation (margin) results in a high degree of\ngeneralisation. Utilising the SVM, we classified track conditions by using the following procedure.First, we classify the obtained data into two classes, “faulty track with longitudinal-level irregularity” or “not.” Next, we classify the data into “faulty track with alignment irregularity”\nor “not.” Subsequently, we classify the data into “faulty track with cross-level irregularity” or “not.”\nFinally, if the data are not classified in the faulty data group, the track is diagnosed as normal. By using\nthe procedure above, the track is diagnosed for every 10 m section with the algorithm.\nWe have not considered for optimising parameters in SVM in this study, but it should beWe performed a vehicle travel simulation using SIMPACK and calculated the car-body vibration when the vehicle was traveling on tracks with different irregularities in some sections.

We subsequently performed a travel\nsimulation by using a track for which all the longitudinal level irregularities, alignment irregularities,\nand cross level irregularities were within the normal range, and also by using a track for which one type of irregularity was abnormal. Degraded track is generated by the power spectral density of track\nwhere the standard deviation becomes twice as large as the normal track. The travelling distance wasThe acceleration root mean square (RMS) is closely linked to the general health of the running gear and track . Therefore, the acceleration RMS can be used as the primary index to predict the\ntrack condition. First, we need to obtain localised RMS values over short time intervals with a small window size to obtain the relationship between track condition and position. The RMS value may be### ∑ x j [,] (1)where xj is the measured vertical acceleration, lateral acceleration or roll angular velocity of car-body Track irregularities include longitudinal level irregularities, alignment irregularities, and cross\nlevel irregularities. In order to assess the irregularities, we determine the RMS values of vertical acceleration, lateral acceleration, and roll rate measured by the compact-sized on-board sensing device.be optimised based on the analysis of collected measurement data as the future work.\nFigure 6 shows the results of car-body vibration calculations, which indicate that longitudinal level and alignment irregularities influence the vertical and lateral accelerations, respectively, while cross level irregularities influence both the lateral acceleration and roll rate. The maximum RMS values for the vertical acceleration, lateral acceleration, and roll rate were calculated for each 10 m section.\nThe section length 10 m is decided based on the consideration of GNSS error.\nFigure 7 shows a feature space created by plotting these values in three dimensions. As shown,\nfour clusters are present, representing a normal track, and abnormal tracks with longitudinal level,\nalignment, and cross level irregularities. It is obvious that such a feature space could be used as\ntraining data for machine learning to enable track conditions to be identified.In this study, we used a support vector machine (SVM), which is a type of machine-learning algorithm created to solve two-class classification problems. An SVM identifies the most distant\npoints (“maximum margin”) between two groups and draws a boundary at the centre point between\nthem. A feature of the SVM is that maximising this separation (margin) results in a high degree of\ngeneralisation. Utilising the SVM, we classified track conditions by using the following procedure.First, we classify the obtained data into two classes, “faulty track with longitudinal-level irregularity” or “not.” Next, we classify the data into “faulty track with alignment irregularity”\nor “not.” Subsequently, we classify the data into “faulty track with cross-level irregularity” or “not.”\nFinally, if the data are not classified in the faulty data group, the track is diagnosed as normal. By using\nthe procedure above, the track is diagnosed for every 10 m section with the algorithm.\nWe have not considered for optimising parameters in SVM in this study, but it should beWe performed a vehicle travel simulation using SIMPACK and calculated the car-body vibration when the vehicle was traveling on tracks with different irregularities in some sections. The obtained\nThe track geometry used for the simulation differed from that shown in Figure 8. The track faults were modelled by increasing the reference track irregularities by factors of 1. and 2. times and added to the reference track geometry. Figure 9 shows the modelled track faults. The track geometry used in the simulation was generated by adding the track fault in Figure 8 to the reference track geometry.\nThe total length of the track geometry was 5000 m. Furthermore, 100 faults of longitudinal level,\nalignment, and cross level irregularities were randamly provided in different places.**Figure 9.** Degraded track geometry in some sections.

The detection results were divided into four classes: normal track, faulty track\nwith longitudinal-level irregularity, faulty track with alignment irregularity, and faulty track with cross-level irregularity. The validity of the detection was evaluated for every 100 faults of longitudinallevel, alignment, and cross level irregularities in 5000 m track lengths. Figure 11 shows the results ofAs shown in Figure 11, the developed algorithm detected the track fault with an accuracy of 80 percent or more for normal and highly degraded tracks. Clearly, the longitudinal level\nirregularity can be detected with high accuracy for normal, intermediate, and highly degraded tracks.\nMeanwhile, the detection accuracy of the alignment and cross level irregularities are lower than that for the longitudinal level irregularity, especially for the intermediately degraded track. However, it is\nnoted that most of the track faults in the regional railway are longitudinal level irregularities.\nTherefore, the developed diagnosis algorithm is considered effective for regional railway lines.\nThe effect of vehicle faults such as wheel flat will appear on the car-body vibration. It is possible to identify the possibility of the faulty train by looking at the measurement data of different places.As an initial test of track fault detection using machine learning, we created clusters of simple features from the car-body vibration data for a regional railway line. To measure the vibration, we used\nan on-board sensing device comprising an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and a GNSS receiver as shown**Figure 12.** Measurement of car-body vibration in a regional railway line.The training data were measured in January, February, May, June, July, and November 2016 for\nsections of the line where repairs for longitudinal level irregularities were performed in October 2016.\nClusters of abnormal track data were created based on the following conditions:• Longitudinal level irregularity: vertical acceleration ≥ 1. m/s• Alignment irregularity: lateral acceleration ≥ 1. m/s and roll rate ≤ 0. rad/sFigure 13 shows the feature space of car-body vibration in a regional railway line. The normal cluster was constructed from car-body vibration data measured in November 2016, immediately after\nlongitudinal level irregularities were repaired. The algorithm detects the location and type of track fault for every 10 m of track. Using the diagnosis algorithm, we diagnosed the track condition in**Figure 13.** Feature space of car-body vibration in a regional railway line.Figure 14 shows the measured RMS values for the car-body vibrations and the results obtained by the detection algorithm (colour map in the upper part of each figure).

The results indicated that combined faults can be detected by the developed algorithm. Therefore, we can conclude**Figure 14.** Detection results for regional railway line.

Further, it is desirable to monitor tracks frequently.\nThe deformations that occur in tracks, referred to as track irregularities, are closely connected to the riding quality and safety of railway vehicles.

Additionally, recent studies proposed employing a Kalman filter to predict track\nirregularities from the acceleration measurements of car-body vibrations of railway vehicles .\nMoreover, on regional railway lines, many operators are unable to implement adequate\ninspections owing to problems such as cost and personnel constraints. Hence, low-cost monitoring systems have been developed based on on-board sensing devices and global navigation satellite system\n(GNSS) data. In this system, the sensing device is installed in an in-service vehicle to measure car-body vibrations. The diagnosis is performed by rating the track conditions based on the measurement data.\nPresently, however, the rating needs to be calculated manually. It is difficult to address a large volume of automatically collected data. To enable the efficient computational processing of collected data,In the present study, we adopted machine learning techniques and developed an algorithm to automatically diagnose track conditions from car-body vibrations to automatically detect track\nirregularities and identify them by type. We subsequently performed a simulation to verify the effectiveness of the developed algorithm. In addition, we examined the possibility of diagnosing trackThe monitoring of railway track geometry from an in-service vehicle became increasingly\nattractive over the past decade . Track geometry measurement systems using in-service vehicles have been developed worldwide, although they are still in the developing stage. The repeated verification\nof the same track provides an opportunity to record track geometry degradation. The obtained information is fed back to the track maintenance section to implement necessary steps.\nSeveral types of track faults are detected by measuring the acceleration of bogies. Weston et al.\ndemonstrated track irregularity monitoring by using bogie-mounted sensors . Alfi et al. proposed a technique to estimate long wavelength track irregularities from on-board measurements . If track\nfaults are detected using car-body mounted sensors, it is easier to perform the condition monitoring of track irregularities.

The system inand diagnosis software for identifying track conditions from the data.condition diagnosis software. The results of the diagnosis are fed back to the infrastructure providers where they are used to help create maintenance plans, select work locations, and assign work priorities.Figure 2 shows a photograph of the compact on-board sensing device used in the track condition monitoring system . The device consists of an accelerometer and rate gyroscope for detecting\ntrack errors, a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver for detecting the train location and\nspeed, and a sensor interface for feeding the signals from the sensors to the computer.The system is battery-powered and conducts continuous measurements for up to six hours,\nand thus measurements are simply obtained by placing it in a car. Measurements are constantly obtained if it is powered by a source on the car. Measurement data are stored into an on-board storage device. Furthermore, the device is equipped with a function to automatically transmit measured data from the on-board storage device to a server via a mobile phone network. The device is further\nequipped with a microphone, and thus, it is also possible to “listen” for corrugation and diagnose either via a mobile phone network or via writing to external media. The diagnostic results produced\nchannels via smartphones or tablet computers. Railway operators use the information to establish the\ntrack maintenance priorities, and thereby facilitate the maintenance planning and work.\nAdditionally, the real-time measurement of vehicle vibrations during in-service operation allows for rapid response, such as emergency track inspection and maintenance, in situations in which vehicle\nvibration observations detect irregularly large deviations from standard control values. Thus, the use of deterioration or other track irregularities, and thereby enables infrastructure providers to conductTrack irregularity inspection includes vertical rail profile, lateral alignment, gauge, cross-level,\ntwist and dipped joint, and corrugation as shown in Figure 3. In the developed monitoring system,\nthe detection of track faults for vertical, lateral alignment, and cross-level is possible by usingof derailments. Thus, they are among the most important items that are monitored. Vehicle vibrations are strongly correlated with track irregularities, and thus the magnitude of vehicle vibrations is\nan effective means for assessing general track condition trends. Thus, sections of track over whichTo analyse the effects of railway track deterioration on car-body vibrations, we performed a railway vehicle travel simulation using SIMPACK, a multibody dynamics software package.\nThe model used for the simulation was a single conventional railway vehicle, the parameters for\nwhich are shown in Table 1. Figure 4 shows the model used in the simulation.The model consists of seven rigid bodies, one car body, two bogies, and four wheelsets,\neach having six degrees of freedom. Thus, 42 degrees of freedom exist in the model. It is necessary to connect each rigid body with an appropriate joint such that the vehicle exhibits a realistic motion.\nOne car-body, two bogies, and four wheelsets were connected by spring and damper elements.\nUsing this vehicle model, we calculated the vertical acceleration, lateral acceleration, and roll rate above the centre of the front bogie at the car body. This simulation study is carried out based on the\nstraight track. Alignment irregularity in curved track is not considered in this paper but should beTrack irregularities can be used as an index for managing track conditions. The types of\ntrack irregularities include longitudinal level irregularities that indicate vertical rail displacement,\nalignment irregularities that indicate lateral rail displacement, and cross level irregularities that indicate a difference in the elevation of the left and right rails. Because a high degree of correlation exists\nbetween these track irregularities and car-body vibrations, the magnitude of car-body vibrations can be an effective method to determine track conditions . The track-condition monitoring system can\nto detect any longitudinal level irregularities, alignment irregularities, and cross level irregularities.\nTo identify different types of track faults by using machine-learning techniques, it is necessary to extract the features of each type of track irregularity from the car-body vibrations that occur when travelling on a faulty track. The data obtained by learning the extracted features can be used to construct a training model. Subsequently, if unknown car-body vibration data are input to the model,\nthe type of track irregularity and its degradation level can be identified.\nAs shown in Figure 5, we created a baseline track geometry for an assumed regional railway line and a track geometry with increased track irregularities. We subsequently performed a travel\nsimulation by using a track for which all the longitudinal level irregularities, alignment irregularities,\nand cross level irregularities were within the normal range, and also by using a track for which one type of irregularity was abnormal.

The results of the diagnosis are fed back to the infrastructure providers where they are used to help create maintenance plans, select work locations, and assign work priorities.Figure 2 shows a photograph of the compact on-board sensing device used in the track condition monitoring system . The device consists of an accelerometer and rate gyroscope for detecting\ntrack errors, a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver for detecting the train location and\nspeed, and a sensor interface for feeding the signals from the sensors to the computer.The system is battery-powered and conducts continuous measurements for up to six hours,\nand thus measurements are simply obtained by placing it in a car. Measurements are constantly obtained if it is powered by a source on the car. Measurement data are stored into an on-board storage device. Furthermore, the device is equipped with a function to automatically transmit measured data from the on-board storage device to a server via a mobile phone network. The device is further\nequipped with a microphone, and thus, it is also possible to “listen” for corrugation and diagnose either via a mobile phone network or via writing to external media. The diagnostic results produced\nchannels via smartphones or tablet computers. Railway operators use the information to establish the\ntrack maintenance priorities, and thereby facilitate the maintenance planning and work.\nAdditionally, the real-time measurement of vehicle vibrations during in-service operation allows for rapid response, such as emergency track inspection and maintenance, in situations in which vehicle\nvibration observations detect irregularly large deviations from standard control values. Thus, the use of deterioration or other track irregularities, and thereby enables infrastructure providers to conductTrack irregularity inspection includes vertical rail profile, lateral alignment, gauge, cross-level,\ntwist and dipped joint, and corrugation as shown in Figure 3. In the developed monitoring system,\nthe detection of track faults for vertical, lateral alignment, and cross-level is possible by usingof derailments. Thus, they are among the most important items that are monitored. Vehicle vibrations are strongly correlated with track irregularities, and thus the magnitude of vehicle vibrations is\nan effective means for assessing general track condition trends. Thus, sections of track over whichTo analyse the effects of railway track deterioration on car-body vibrations, we performed a railway vehicle travel simulation using SIMPACK, a multibody dynamics software package.\nThe model used for the simulation was a single conventional railway vehicle, the parameters for\nwhich are shown in Table 1. Figure 4 shows the model used in the simulation.The model consists of seven rigid bodies, one car body, two bogies, and four wheelsets,\neach having six degrees of freedom. Thus, 42 degrees of freedom exist in the model. It is necessary to connect each rigid body with an appropriate joint such that the vehicle exhibits a realistic motion.\nOne car-body, two bogies, and four wheelsets were connected by spring and damper elements.\nUsing this vehicle model, we calculated the vertical acceleration, lateral acceleration, and roll rate above the centre of the front bogie at the car body. This simulation study is carried out based on the\nstraight track. Alignment irregularity in curved track is not considered in this paper but should beTrack irregularities can be used as an index for managing track conditions. The types of\ntrack irregularities include longitudinal level irregularities that indicate vertical rail displacement,\nalignment irregularities that indicate lateral rail displacement, and cross level irregularities that indicate a difference in the elevation of the left and right rails. Because a high degree of correlation exists\nbetween these track irregularities and car-body vibrations, the magnitude of car-body vibrations can be an effective method to determine track conditions . The track-condition monitoring system can\nto detect any longitudinal level irregularities, alignment irregularities, and cross level irregularities.\nTo identify different types of track faults by using machine-learning techniques, it is necessary to extract the features of each type of track irregularity from the car-body vibrations that occur when travelling on a faulty track. The data obtained by learning the extracted features can be used to construct a training model. Subsequently, if unknown car-body vibration data are input to the model,\nthe type of track irregularity and its degradation level can be identified.\nAs shown in Figure 5, we created a baseline track geometry for an assumed regional railway line and a track geometry with increased track irregularities. We subsequently performed a travel\nsimulation by using a track for which all the longitudinal level irregularities, alignment irregularities,\nand cross level irregularities were within the normal range, and also by using a track for which one type of irregularity was abnormal. Degraded track is generated by the power spectral density of track\nwhere the standard deviation becomes twice as large as the normal track. The travelling distance wasThe acceleration root mean square (RMS) is closely linked to the general health of the running gear and track . Therefore, the acceleration RMS can be used as the primary index to predict the\ntrack condition. First, we need to obtain localised RMS values over short time intervals with a small window size to obtain the relationship between track condition and position. The RMS value may be### ∑ x j [,] (1)where xj is the measured vertical acceleration, lateral acceleration or roll angular velocity of car-body Track irregularities include longitudinal level irregularities, alignment irregularities, and cross\nlevel irregularities. In order to assess the irregularities, we determine the RMS values of vertical acceleration, lateral acceleration, and roll rate measured by the compact-sized on-board sensing device.be optimised based on the analysis of collected measurement data as the future work.\nFigure 6 shows the results of car-body vibration calculations, which indicate that longitudinal level and alignment irregularities influence the vertical and lateral accelerations, respectively, while cross level irregularities influence both the lateral acceleration and roll rate. The maximum RMS values for the vertical acceleration, lateral acceleration, and roll rate were calculated for each 10 m section.\nThe section length 10 m is decided based on the consideration of GNSS error.\nFigure 7 shows a feature space created by plotting these values in three dimensions. As shown,\nfour clusters are present, representing a normal track, and abnormal tracks with longitudinal level,\nalignment, and cross level irregularities. It is obvious that such a feature space could be used as\ntraining data for machine learning to enable track conditions to be identified.In this study, we used a support vector machine (SVM), which is a type of machine-learning algorithm created to solve two-class classification problems. An SVM identifies the most distant\npoints (“maximum margin”) between two groups and draws a boundary at the centre point between\nthem. A feature of the SVM is that maximising this separation (margin) results in a high degree of\ngeneralisation. Utilising the SVM, we classified track conditions by using the following procedure.First, we classify the obtained data into two classes, “faulty track with longitudinal-level irregularity” or “not.” Next, we classify the data into “faulty track with alignment irregularity”\nor “not.” Subsequently, we classify the data into “faulty track with cross-level irregularity” or “not.”\nFinally, if the data are not classified in the faulty data group, the track is diagnosed as normal. By using\nthe procedure above, the track is diagnosed for every 10 m section with the algorithm.\nWe have not considered for optimising parameters in SVM in this study, but it should beWe performed a vehicle travel simulation using SIMPACK and calculated the car-body vibration when the vehicle was traveling on tracks with different irregularities in some sections. The obtained\nThe track geometry used for the simulation differed from that shown in Figure 8. The track faults were modelled by increasing the reference track irregularities by factors of 1. and 2. times and added to the reference track geometry. Figure 9 shows the modelled track faults. The track geometry used in the simulation was generated by adding the track fault in Figure 8 to the reference track geometry.\nThe total length of the track geometry was 5000 m. Furthermore, 100 faults of longitudinal level,\nalignment, and cross level irregularities were randamly provided in different places.**Figure 9.** Degraded track geometry in some sections. ( **a** ) Longitudinal level geometry. ( **b** ) AlignmentFigure 10 shows the calculation result of the car-body vibrations when a vehicle travels the track geometry shown in Figure 9. As shown in Figure 10, only the vertical or lateral acceleration increases\nwhen the longitudinal level irregularity or the alignment irregularity increase. As shown, both the\nlateral acceleration and roll rate increase when the cross level irregularity increases.**Figure 10.** Calculated car-body vibration by using Figure 9.

The detection results were divided into four classes: normal track, faulty track\nwith longitudinal-level irregularity, faulty track with alignment irregularity, and faulty track with cross-level irregularity. The validity of the detection was evaluated for every 100 faults of longitudinallevel, alignment, and cross level irregularities in 5000 m track lengths. Figure 11 shows the results ofAs shown in Figure 11, the developed algorithm detected the track fault with an accuracy of 80 percent or more for normal and highly degraded tracks. Clearly, the longitudinal level\nirregularity can be detected with high accuracy for normal, intermediate, and highly degraded tracks.\nMeanwhile, the detection accuracy of the alignment and cross level irregularities are lower than that for the longitudinal level irregularity, especially for the intermediately degraded track. However, it is\nnoted that most of the track faults in the regional railway are longitudinal level irregularities.\nTherefore, the developed diagnosis algorithm is considered effective for regional railway lines.\nThe effect of vehicle faults such as wheel flat will appear on the car-body vibration. It is possible to identify the possibility of the faulty train by looking at the measurement data of different places.As an initial test of track fault detection using machine learning, we created clusters of simple features from the car-body vibration data for a regional railway line. To measure the vibration, we used\nan on-board sensing device comprising an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and a GNSS receiver as shown**Figure 12.** Measurement of car-body vibration in a regional railway line.The training data were measured in January, February, May, June, July, and November 2016 for\nsections of the line where repairs for longitudinal level irregularities were performed in October 2016.\nClusters of abnormal track data were created based on the following conditions:• Longitudinal level irregularity: vertical acceleration ≥ 1. m/s• Alignment irregularity: lateral acceleration ≥ 1. m/s and roll rate ≤ 0. rad/sFigure 13 shows the feature space of car-body vibration in a regional railway line.

The algorithm detects the location and type of track fault for every 10 m of track. Using the diagnosis algorithm, we diagnosed the track condition in**Figure 13.** Feature space of car-body vibration in a regional railway line.Figure 14 shows the measured RMS values for the car-body vibrations and the results obtained by the detection algorithm (colour map in the upper part of each figure).

Additionally, recent studies proposed employing a Kalman filter to predict track\nirregularities from the acceleration measurements of car-body vibrations of railway vehicles .\nMoreover, on regional railway lines, many operators are unable to implement adequate\ninspections owing to problems such as cost and personnel constraints.

Further, it is desirable to monitor tracks frequently.\nThe deformations that occur in tracks, referred to as track irregularities, are closely connected to the riding quality and safety of railway vehicles. Urban railway operators use track inspection cars to\nTrack condition monitoring systems that observe car-body vibrations in in-service vehicles have conditions . Additionally, recent studies proposed employing a Kalman filter to predict track\nirregularities from the acceleration measurements of car-body vibrations of railway vehicles .\nMoreover, on regional railway lines, many operators are unable to implement adequate\ninspections owing to problems such as cost and personnel constraints. Hence, low-cost monitoring systems have been developed based on on-board sensing devices and global navigation satellite system\n(GNSS) data. In this system, the sensing device is installed in an in-service vehicle to measure car-body vibrations. The diagnosis is performed by rating the track conditions based on the measurement data.\nPresently, however, the rating needs to be calculated manually. It is difficult to address a large volume of automatically collected data. To enable the efficient computational processing of collected data,In the present study, we adopted machine learning techniques and developed an algorithm to automatically diagnose track conditions from car-body vibrations to automatically detect track\nirregularities and identify them by type. We subsequently performed a simulation to verify the effectiveness of the developed algorithm. In addition, we examined the possibility of diagnosing trackThe monitoring of railway track geometry from an in-service vehicle became increasingly\nattractive over the past decade . Track geometry measurement systems using in-service vehicles have been developed worldwide, although they are still in the developing stage. The repeated verification\nof the same track provides an opportunity to record track geometry degradation. The obtained information is fed back to the track maintenance section to implement necessary steps.\nSeveral types of track faults are detected by measuring the acceleration of bogies. Weston et al.\ndemonstrated track irregularity monitoring by using bogie-mounted sensors . Alfi et al. proposed a technique to estimate long wavelength track irregularities from on-board measurements .

The results of the diagnosis are fed back to the infrastructure providers where they are used to help create maintenance plans, select work locations, and assign work priorities.Figure 2 shows a photograph of the compact on-board sensing device used in the track condition monitoring system . The device consists of an accelerometer and rate gyroscope for detecting\ntrack errors, a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver for detecting the train location and\nspeed, and a sensor interface for feeding the signals from the sensors to the computer.The system is battery-powered and conducts continuous measurements for up to six hours,\nand thus measurements are simply obtained by placing it in a car. Measurements are constantly obtained if it is powered by a source on the car. Measurement data are stored into an on-board storage device. Furthermore, the device is equipped with a function to automatically transmit measured data from the on-board storage device to a server via a mobile phone network. The device is further\nequipped with a microphone, and thus, it is also possible to “listen” for corrugation and diagnose either via a mobile phone network or via writing to external media. The diagnostic results produced\nchannels via smartphones or tablet computers. Railway operators use the information to establish the\ntrack maintenance priorities, and thereby facilitate the maintenance planning and work.\nAdditionally, the real-time measurement of vehicle vibrations during in-service operation allows for rapid response, such as emergency track inspection and maintenance, in situations in which vehicle\nvibration observations detect irregularly large deviations from standard control values. Thus, the use of deterioration or other track irregularities, and thereby enables infrastructure providers to conductTrack irregularity inspection includes vertical rail profile, lateral alignment, gauge, cross-level,\ntwist and dipped joint, and corrugation as shown in Figure 3. In the developed monitoring system,\nthe detection of track faults for vertical, lateral alignment, and cross-level is possible by usingof derailments. Thus, they are among the most important items that are monitored. Vehicle vibrations are strongly correlated with track irregularities, and thus the magnitude of vehicle vibrations is\nan effective means for assessing general track condition trends. Thus, sections of track over whichTo analyse the effects of railway track deterioration on car-body vibrations, we performed a railway vehicle travel simulation using SIMPACK, a multibody dynamics software package.\nThe model used for the simulation was a single conventional railway vehicle, the parameters for\nwhich are shown in Table 1. Figure 4 shows the model used in the simulation.The model consists of seven rigid bodies, one car body, two bogies, and four wheelsets,\neach having six degrees of freedom. Thus, 42 degrees of freedom exist in the model. It is necessary to connect each rigid body with an appropriate joint such that the vehicle exhibits a realistic motion.\nOne car-body, two bogies, and four wheelsets were connected by spring and damper elements.\nUsing this vehicle model, we calculated the vertical acceleration, lateral acceleration, and roll rate above the centre of the front bogie at the car body. This simulation study is carried out based on the\nstraight track. Alignment irregularity in curved track is not considered in this paper but should beTrack irregularities can be used as an index for managing track conditions. The types of\ntrack irregularities include longitudinal level irregularities that indicate vertical rail displacement,\nalignment irregularities that indicate lateral rail displacement, and cross level irregularities that indicate a difference in the elevation of the left and right rails. Because a high degree of correlation exists\nbetween these track irregularities and car-body vibrations, the magnitude of car-body vibrations can be an effective method to determine track conditions . The track-condition monitoring system can\nto detect any longitudinal level irregularities, alignment irregularities, and cross level irregularities.\nTo identify different types of track faults by using machine-learning techniques, it is necessary to extract the features of each type of track irregularity from the car-body vibrations that occur when travelling on a faulty track. The data obtained by learning the extracted features can be used to construct a training model. Subsequently, if unknown car-body vibration data are input to the model,\nthe type of track irregularity and its degradation level can be identified.\nAs shown in Figure 5, we created a baseline track geometry for an assumed regional railway line and a track geometry with increased track irregularities. We subsequently performed a travel\nsimulation by using a track for which all the longitudinal level irregularities, alignment irregularities,\nand cross level irregularities were within the normal range, and also by using a track for which one type of irregularity was abnormal. Degraded track is generated by the power spectral density of track\nwhere the standard deviation becomes twice as large as the normal track. The travelling distance wasThe acceleration root mean square (RMS) is closely linked to the general health of the running gear and track . Therefore, the acceleration RMS can be used as the primary index to predict the\ntrack condition. First, we need to obtain localised RMS values over short time intervals with a small window size to obtain the relationship between track condition and position. The RMS value may be### ∑ x j [,] (1)where xj is the measured vertical acceleration, lateral acceleration or roll angular velocity of car-body Track irregularities include longitudinal level irregularities, alignment irregularities, and cross\nlevel irregularities. In order to assess the irregularities, we determine the RMS values of vertical acceleration, lateral acceleration, and roll rate measured by the compact-sized on-board sensing device.be optimised based on the analysis of collected measurement data as the future work.\nFigure 6 shows the results of car-body vibration calculations, which indicate that longitudinal level and alignment irregularities influence the vertical and lateral accelerations, respectively, while cross level irregularities influence both the lateral acceleration and roll rate. The maximum RMS values for the vertical acceleration, lateral acceleration, and roll rate were calculated for each 10 m section.\nThe section length 10 m is decided based on the consideration of GNSS error.\nFigure 7 shows a feature space created by plotting these values in three dimensions. As shown,\nfour clusters are present, representing a normal track, and abnormal tracks with longitudinal level,\nalignment, and cross level irregularities. It is obvious that such a feature space could be used as\ntraining data for machine learning to enable track conditions to be identified.In this study, we used a support vector machine (SVM), which is a type of machine-learning algorithm created to solve two-class classification problems. An SVM identifies the most distant\npoints (“maximum margin”) between two groups and draws a boundary at the centre point between\nthem. A feature of the SVM is that maximising this separation (margin) results in a high degree of\ngeneralisation. Utilising the SVM, we classified track conditions by using the following procedure.First, we classify the obtained data into two classes, “faulty track with longitudinal-level irregularity” or “not.” Next, we classify the data into “faulty track with alignment irregularity”\nor “not.” Subsequently, we classify the data into “faulty track with cross-level irregularity” or “not.”\nFinally, if the data are not classified in the faulty data group, the track is diagnosed as normal. By using\nthe procedure above, the track is diagnosed for every 10 m section with the algorithm.\nWe have not considered for optimising parameters in SVM in this study, but it should beWe performed a vehicle travel simulation using SIMPACK and calculated the car-body vibration when the vehicle was traveling on tracks with different irregularities in some sections. The obtained\nThe track geometry used for the simulation differed from that shown in Figure 8. The track faults were modelled by increasing the reference track irregularities by factors of 1. and 2. times and added to the reference track geometry. Figure 9 shows the modelled track faults. The track geometry used in the simulation was generated by adding the track fault in Figure 8 to the reference track geometry.\nThe total length of the track geometry was 5000 m. Furthermore, 100 faults of longitudinal level,\nalignment, and cross level irregularities were randamly provided in different places.**Figure 9.** Degraded track geometry in some sections. ( **a** ) Longitudinal level geometry. ( **b** ) AlignmentFigure 10 shows the calculation result of the car-body vibrations when a vehicle travels the track geometry shown in Figure 9. As shown in Figure 10, only the vertical or lateral acceleration increases\nwhen the longitudinal level irregularity or the alignment irregularity increase. As shown, both the\nlateral acceleration and roll rate increase when the cross level irregularity increases.**Figure 10.** Calculated car-body vibration by using Figure 9. ( **a** ) Vertical acceleration. ( **b** ) Lateralthe simulated car-body vibration data. For the training data, we used the feature space as shown in Figure 6. The detection results were divided into four classes: normal track, faulty track\nwith longitudinal-level irregularity, faulty track with alignment irregularity, and faulty track with cross-level irregularity. The validity of the detection was evaluated for every 100 faults of longitudinallevel, alignment, and cross level irregularities in 5000 m track lengths. Figure 11 shows the results ofAs shown in Figure 11, the developed algorithm detected the track fault with an accuracy of 80 percent or more for normal and highly degraded tracks. Clearly, the longitudinal level\nirregularity can be detected with high accuracy for normal, intermediate, and highly degraded tracks.\nMeanwhile, the detection accuracy of the alignment and cross level irregularities are lower than that for the longitudinal level irregularity, especially for the intermediately degraded track. However, it is\nnoted that most of the track faults in the regional railway are longitudinal level irregularities.\nTherefore, the developed diagnosis algorithm is considered effective for regional railway lines.\nThe effect of vehicle faults such as wheel flat will appear on the car-body vibration. It is possible to identify the possibility of the faulty train by looking at the measurement data of different places.As an initial test of track fault detection using machine learning, we created clusters of simple features from the car-body vibration data for a regional railway line. To measure the vibration, we used\nan on-board sensing device comprising an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and a GNSS receiver as shown**Figure 12.** Measurement of car-body vibration in a regional railway line.The training data were measured in January, February, May, June, July, and November 2016 for\nsections of the line where repairs for longitudinal level irregularities were performed in October 2016.\nClusters of abnormal track data were created based on the following conditions:• Longitudinal level irregularity: vertical acceleration ≥ 1. m/s• Alignment irregularity: lateral acceleration ≥ 1. m/s and roll rate ≤ 0. rad/sFigure 13 shows the feature space of car-body vibration in a regional railway line.

Using the diagnosis algorithm, we diagnosed the track condition in**Figure 13.** Feature space of car-body vibration in a regional railway line.Figure 14 shows the measured RMS values for the car-body vibrations and the results obtained by the detection algorithm (colour map in the upper part of each figure).

To measure the vibration, we used\nan on-board sensing device comprising an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and a GNSS receiver as shown**Figure 12.** Measurement of car-body vibration in a regional railway line.The training data were measured in January, February, May, June, July, and November 2016 for\nsections of the line where repairs for longitudinal level irregularities were performed in October 2016.\nClusters of abnormal track data were created based on the following conditions:• Longitudinal level irregularity: vertical acceleration ≥ 1. m/s• Alignment irregularity: lateral acceleration ≥ 1. m/s and roll rate ≤ 0. rad/sFigure 13 shows the feature space of car-body vibration in a regional railway line. The normal cluster was constructed from car-body vibration data measured in November 2016, immediately after\nlongitudinal level irregularities were repaired. The algorithm detects the location and type of track fault for every 10 m of track. Using the diagnosis algorithm, we diagnosed the track condition in**Figure 13.** Feature space of car-body vibration in a regional railway line.Figure 14 shows the measured RMS values for the car-body vibrations and the results obtained by the detection algorithm (colour map in the upper part of each figure).

The results indicated that combined faults can be detected by the developed algorithm. Therefore, we can conclude**Figure 14.** Detection results for regional railway line.

This, in turn, has spurred the interest in using this type of monitoring\nto create maintenance plans or schedule condition-based maintenance when the track conditions The condition of railway tracks is an important factor in ensuring the safe operation of trains.\nTo ensure that railway travel is safe and comfortable, it is necessary to maintain and manage tracks properly; this includes preventive maintenance. Further, it is desirable to monitor tracks frequently.\nThe deformations that occur in tracks, referred to as track irregularities, are closely connected to the riding quality and safety of railway vehicles. Urban railway operators use track inspection cars to\nTrack condition monitoring systems that observe car-body vibrations in in-service vehicles have conditions . Additionally, recent studies proposed employing a Kalman filter to predict track\nirregularities from the acceleration measurements of car-body vibrations of railway vehicles .\nMoreover, on regional railway lines, many operators are unable to implement adequate\ninspections owing to problems such as cost and personnel constraints. Hence, low-cost monitoring systems have been developed based on on-board sensing devices and global navigation satellite system\n(GNSS) data. In this system, the sensing device is installed in an in-service vehicle to measure car-body vibrations. The diagnosis is performed by rating the track conditions based on the measurement data.\nPresently, however, the rating needs to be calculated manually. It is difficult to address a large volume of automatically collected data. To enable the efficient computational processing of collected data,In the present study, we adopted machine learning techniques and developed an algorithm to automatically diagnose track conditions from car-body vibrations to automatically detect track\nirregularities and identify them by type. We subsequently performed a simulation to verify the effectiveness of the developed algorithm. In addition, we examined the possibility of diagnosing trackThe monitoring of railway track geometry from an in-service vehicle became increasingly\nattractive over the past decade . Track geometry measurement systems using in-service vehicles have been developed worldwide, although they are still in the developing stage. The repeated verification\nof the same track provides an opportunity to record track geometry degradation. The obtained information is fed back to the track maintenance section to implement necessary steps.\nSeveral types of track faults are detected by measuring the acceleration of bogies. Weston et al.\ndemonstrated track irregularity monitoring by using bogie-mounted sensors . Alfi et al. proposed a technique to estimate long wavelength track irregularities from on-board measurements . If track\nfaults are detected using car-body mounted sensors, it is easier to perform the condition monitoring of track irregularities.

The results of the diagnosis are fed back to the infrastructure providers where they are used to help create maintenance plans, select work locations, and assign work priorities.Figure 2 shows a photograph of the compact on-board sensing device used in the track condition monitoring system . The device consists of an accelerometer and rate gyroscope for detecting\ntrack errors, a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver for detecting the train location and\nspeed, and a sensor interface for feeding the signals from the sensors to the computer.The system is battery-powered and conducts continuous measurements for up to six hours,\nand thus measurements are simply obtained by placing it in a car. Measurements are constantly obtained if it is powered by a source on the car. Measurement data are stored into an on-board storage device. Furthermore, the device is equipped with a function to automatically transmit measured data from the on-board storage device to a server via a mobile phone network. The device is further\nequipped with a microphone, and thus, it is also possible to “listen” for corrugation and diagnose either via a mobile phone network or via writing to external media. The diagnostic results produced\nchannels via smartphones or tablet computers. Railway operators use the information to establish the\ntrack maintenance priorities, and thereby facilitate the maintenance planning and work.\nAdditionally, the real-time measurement of vehicle vibrations during in-service operation allows for rapid response, such as emergency track inspection and maintenance, in situations in which vehicle\nvibration observations detect irregularly large deviations from standard control values. Thus, the use of deterioration or other track irregularities, and thereby enables infrastructure providers to conductTrack irregularity inspection includes vertical rail profile, lateral alignment, gauge, cross-level,\ntwist and dipped joint, and corrugation as shown in Figure 3. In the developed monitoring system,\nthe detection of track faults for vertical, lateral alignment, and cross-level is possible by usingof derailments. Thus, they are among the most important items that are monitored. Vehicle vibrations are strongly correlated with track irregularities, and thus the magnitude of vehicle vibrations is\nan effective means for assessing general track condition trends. Thus, sections of track over whichTo analyse the effects of railway track deterioration on car-body vibrations, we performed a railway vehicle travel simulation using SIMPACK, a multibody dynamics software package.\nThe model used for the simulation was a single conventional railway vehicle, the parameters for\nwhich are shown in Table 1. Figure 4 shows the model used in the simulation.The model consists of seven rigid bodies, one car body, two bogies, and four wheelsets,\neach having six degrees of freedom. Thus, 42 degrees of freedom exist in the model. It is necessary to connect each rigid body with an appropriate joint such that the vehicle exhibits a realistic motion.\nOne car-body, two bogies, and four wheelsets were connected by spring and damper elements.\nUsing this vehicle model, we calculated the vertical acceleration, lateral acceleration, and roll rate above the centre of the front bogie at the car body. This simulation study is carried out based on the\nstraight track. Alignment irregularity in curved track is not considered in this paper but should beTrack irregularities can be used as an index for managing track conditions. The types of\ntrack irregularities include longitudinal level irregularities that indicate vertical rail displacement,\nalignment irregularities that indicate lateral rail displacement, and cross level irregularities that indicate a difference in the elevation of the left and right rails. Because a high degree of correlation exists\nbetween these track irregularities and car-body vibrations, the magnitude of car-body vibrations can be an effective method to determine track conditions . The track-condition monitoring system can\nto detect any longitudinal level irregularities, alignment irregularities, and cross level irregularities.\nTo identify different types of track faults by using machine-learning techniques, it is necessary to extract the features of each type of track irregularity from the car-body vibrations that occur when travelling on a faulty track. The data obtained by learning the extracted features can be used to construct a training model. Subsequently, if unknown car-body vibration data are input to the model,\nthe type of track irregularity and its degradation level can be identified.\nAs shown in Figure 5, we created a baseline track geometry for an assumed regional railway line and a track geometry with increased track irregularities. We subsequently performed a travel\nsimulation by using a track for which all the longitudinal level irregularities, alignment irregularities,\nand cross level irregularities were within the normal range, and also by using a track for which one type of irregularity was abnormal. Degraded track is generated by the power spectral density of track\nwhere the standard deviation becomes twice as large as the normal track. The travelling distance wasThe acceleration root mean square (RMS) is closely linked to the general health of the running gear and track . Therefore, the acceleration RMS can be used as the primary index to predict the\ntrack condition. First, we need to obtain localised RMS values over short time intervals with a small window size to obtain the relationship between track condition and position. The RMS value may be### ∑ x j [,] (1)where xj is the measured vertical acceleration, lateral acceleration or roll angular velocity of car-body Track irregularities include longitudinal level irregularities, alignment irregularities, and cross\nlevel irregularities. In order to assess the irregularities, we determine the RMS values of vertical acceleration, lateral acceleration, and roll rate measured by the compact-sized on-board sensing device.be optimised based on the analysis of collected measurement data as the future work.\nFigure 6 shows the results of car-body vibration calculations, which indicate that longitudinal level and alignment irregularities influence the vertical and lateral accelerations, respectively, while cross level irregularities influence both the lateral acceleration and roll rate. The maximum RMS values for the vertical acceleration, lateral acceleration, and roll rate were calculated for each 10 m section.\nThe section length 10 m is decided based on the consideration of GNSS error.\nFigure 7 shows a feature space created by plotting these values in three dimensions. As shown,\nfour clusters are present, representing a normal track, and abnormal tracks with longitudinal level,\nalignment, and cross level irregularities. It is obvious that such a feature space could be used as\ntraining data for machine learning to enable track conditions to be identified.In this study, we used a support vector machine (SVM), which is a type of machine-learning algorithm created to solve two-class classification problems. An SVM identifies the most distant\npoints (“maximum margin”) between two groups and draws a boundary at the centre point between\nthem. A feature of the SVM is that maximising this separation (margin) results in a high degree of\ngeneralisation. Utilising the SVM, we classified track conditions by using the following procedure.First, we classify the obtained data into two classes, “faulty track with longitudinal-level irregularity” or “not.” Next, we classify the data into “faulty track with alignment irregularity”\nor “not.” Subsequently, we classify the data into “faulty track with cross-level irregularity” or “not.”\nFinally, if the data are not classified in the faulty data group, the track is diagnosed as normal. By using\nthe procedure above, the track is diagnosed for every 10 m section with the algorithm.\nWe have not considered for optimising parameters in SVM in this study, but it should beWe performed a vehicle travel simulation using SIMPACK and calculated the car-body vibration when the vehicle was traveling on tracks with different irregularities in some sections. The obtained\nThe track geometry used for the simulation differed from that shown in Figure 8. The track faults were modelled by increasing the reference track irregularities by factors of 1. and 2. times and added to the reference track geometry. Figure 9 shows the modelled track faults. The track geometry used in the simulation was generated by adding the track fault in Figure 8 to the reference track geometry.\nThe total length of the track geometry was 5000 m. Furthermore, 100 faults of longitudinal level,\nalignment, and cross level irregularities were randamly provided in different places.**Figure 9.** Degraded track geometry in some sections. ( **a** ) Longitudinal level geometry. ( **b** ) AlignmentFigure 10 shows the calculation result of the car-body vibrations when a vehicle travels the track geometry shown in Figure 9. As shown in Figure 10, only the vertical or lateral acceleration increases\nwhen the longitudinal level irregularity or the alignment irregularity increase. As shown, both the\nlateral acceleration and roll rate increase when the cross level irregularity increases.**Figure 10.** Calculated car-body vibration by using Figure 9. ( **a** ) Vertical acceleration. ( **b** ) Lateralthe simulated car-body vibration data. For the training data, we used the feature space as shown in Figure 6. The detection results were divided into four classes: normal track, faulty track\nwith longitudinal-level irregularity, faulty track with alignment irregularity, and faulty track with cross-level irregularity. The validity of the detection was evaluated for every 100 faults of longitudinallevel, alignment, and cross level irregularities in 5000 m track lengths. Figure 11 shows the results ofAs shown in Figure 11, the developed algorithm detected the track fault with an accuracy of 80 percent or more for normal and highly degraded tracks. Clearly, the longitudinal level\nirregularity can be detected with high accuracy for normal, intermediate, and highly degraded tracks.\nMeanwhile, the detection accuracy of the alignment and cross level irregularities are lower than that for the longitudinal level irregularity, especially for the intermediately degraded track. However, it is\nnoted that most of the track faults in the regional railway are longitudinal level irregularities.\nTherefore, the developed diagnosis algorithm is considered effective for regional railway lines.\nThe effect of vehicle faults such as wheel flat will appear on the car-body vibration. It is possible to identify the possibility of the faulty train by looking at the measurement data of different places.As an initial test of track fault detection using machine learning, we created clusters of simple features from the car-body vibration data for a regional railway line.

Degraded track is generated by the power spectral density of track\nwhere the standard deviation becomes twice as large as the normal track. The travelling distance wasThe acceleration root mean square (RMS) is closely linked to the general health of the running gear and track . Therefore, the acceleration RMS can be used as the primary index to predict the\ntrack condition. First, we need to obtain localised RMS values over short time intervals with a small window size to obtain the relationship between track condition and position. The RMS value may be### ∑ x j [,] (1)where xj is the measured vertical acceleration, lateral acceleration or roll angular velocity of car-body Track irregularities include longitudinal level irregularities, alignment irregularities, and cross\nlevel irregularities. In order to assess the irregularities, we determine the RMS values of vertical acceleration, lateral acceleration, and roll rate measured by the compact-sized on-board sensing device.be optimised based on the analysis of collected measurement data as the future work.\nFigure 6 shows the results of car-body vibration calculations, which indicate that longitudinal level and alignment irregularities influence the vertical and lateral accelerations, respectively, while cross level irregularities influence both the lateral acceleration and roll rate. The maximum RMS values for the vertical acceleration, lateral acceleration, and roll rate were calculated for each 10 m section.\nThe section length 10 m is decided based on the consideration of GNSS error.\nFigure 7 shows a feature space created by plotting these values in three dimensions. As shown,\nfour clusters are present, representing a normal track, and abnormal tracks with longitudinal level,\nalignment, and cross level irregularities. It is obvious that such a feature space could be used as\ntraining data for machine learning to enable track conditions to be identified.In this study, we used a support vector machine (SVM), which is a type of machine-learning algorithm created to solve two-class classification problems. An SVM identifies the most distant\npoints (“maximum margin”) between two groups and draws a boundary at the centre point between\nthem. A feature of the SVM is that maximising this separation (margin) results in a high degree of\ngeneralisation. Utilising the SVM, we classified track conditions by using the following procedure.First, we classify the obtained data into two classes, “faulty track with longitudinal-level irregularity” or “not.” Next, we classify the data into “faulty track with alignment irregularity”\nor “not.” Subsequently, we classify the data into “faulty track with cross-level irregularity” or “not.”\nFinally, if the data are not classified in the faulty data group, the track is diagnosed as normal. By using\nthe procedure above, the track is diagnosed for every 10 m section with the algorithm.\nWe have not considered for optimising parameters in SVM in this study, but it should beWe performed a vehicle travel simulation using SIMPACK and calculated the car-body vibration when the vehicle was traveling on tracks with different irregularities in some sections. The obtained\nThe track geometry used for the simulation differed from that shown in Figure 8. The track faults were modelled by increasing the reference track irregularities by factors of 1. and 2. times and added to the reference track geometry. Figure 9 shows the modelled track faults. The track geometry used in the simulation was generated by adding the track fault in Figure 8 to the reference track geometry.\nThe total length of the track geometry was 5000 m. Furthermore, 100 faults of longitudinal level,\nalignment, and cross level irregularities were randamly provided in different places.**Figure 9.** Degraded track geometry in some sections.

The detection results were divided into four classes: normal track, faulty track\nwith longitudinal-level irregularity, faulty track with alignment irregularity, and faulty track with cross-level irregularity. The validity of the detection was evaluated for every 100 faults of longitudinallevel, alignment, and cross level irregularities in 5000 m track lengths. Figure 11 shows the results ofAs shown in Figure 11, the developed algorithm detected the track fault with an accuracy of 80 percent or more for normal and highly degraded tracks. Clearly, the longitudinal level\nirregularity can be detected with high accuracy for normal, intermediate, and highly degraded tracks.\nMeanwhile, the detection accuracy of the alignment and cross level irregularities are lower than that for the longitudinal level irregularity, especially for the intermediately degraded track. However, it is\nnoted that most of the track faults in the regional railway are longitudinal level irregularities.\nTherefore, the developed diagnosis algorithm is considered effective for regional railway lines.\nThe effect of vehicle faults such as wheel flat will appear on the car-body vibration. It is possible to identify the possibility of the faulty train by looking at the measurement data of different places.As an initial test of track fault detection using machine learning, we created clusters of simple features from the car-body vibration data for a regional railway line. To measure the vibration, we used\nan on-board sensing device comprising an accelerometer, a gyroscope, and a GNSS receiver as shown**Figure 12.** Measurement of car-body vibration in a regional railway line.The training data were measured in January, February, May, June, July, and November 2016 for\nsections of the line where repairs for longitudinal level irregularities were performed in October 2016.\nClusters of abnormal track data were created based on the following conditions:• Longitudinal level irregularity: vertical acceleration ≥ 1. m/s• Alignment irregularity: lateral acceleration ≥ 1. m/s and roll rate ≤ 0. rad/sFigure 13 shows the feature space of car-body vibration in a regional railway line. The normal cluster was constructed from car-body vibration data measured in November 2016, immediately after\nlongitudinal level irregularities were repaired. The algorithm detects the location and type of track fault for every 10 m of track. Using the diagnosis algorithm, we diagnosed the track condition in**Figure 13.** Feature space of car-body vibration in a regional railway line.Figure 14 shows the measured RMS values for the car-body vibrations and the results obtained by the detection algorithm (colour map in the upper part of each figure).

A classifier for track faults has been developed to detect track fault automatically. Simulation studies using\nSIMPACK and field tests were carried out to detect and isolate the track faults from car-body vibration.\nThe results show that the feature of track faults is extracted from car-body vibration and classified**Keywords:** railway; condition monitoring; fault detection; preventive maintenance; machine learningWith the recent development of sensors and information technology (IT), conditions in railway adjacent to the track. This, in turn, has spurred the interest in using this type of monitoring\nto create maintenance plans or schedule condition-based maintenance when the track conditions The condition of railway tracks is an important factor in ensuring the safe operation of trains.\nTo ensure that railway travel is safe and comfortable, it is necessary to maintain and manage tracks properly; this includes preventive maintenance. Further, it is desirable to monitor tracks frequently.\nThe deformations that occur in tracks, referred to as track irregularities, are closely connected to the riding quality and safety of railway vehicles. Urban railway operators use track inspection cars to\nTrack condition monitoring systems that observe car-body vibrations in in-service vehicles have conditions . Additionally, recent studies proposed employing a Kalman filter to predict track\nirregularities from the acceleration measurements of car-body vibrations of railway vehicles .\nMoreover, on regional railway lines, many operators are unable to implement adequate\ninspections owing to problems such as cost and personnel constraints. Hence, low-cost monitoring systems have been developed based on on-board sensing devices and global navigation satellite system\n(GNSS) data. In this system, the sensing device is installed in an in-service vehicle to measure car-body vibrations. The diagnosis is performed by rating the track conditions based on the measurement data.\nPresently, however, the rating needs to be calculated manually. It is difficult to address a large volume of automatically collected data. To enable the efficient computational processing of collected data,In the present study, we adopted machine learning techniques and developed an algorithm to automatically diagnose track conditions from car-body vibrations to automatically detect track\nirregularities and identify them by type. We subsequently performed a simulation to verify the effectiveness of the developed algorithm. In addition, we examined the possibility of diagnosing trackThe monitoring of railway track geometry from an in-service vehicle became increasingly\nattractive over the past decade . Track geometry measurement systems using in-service vehicles have been developed worldwide, although they are still in the developing stage. The repeated verification\nof the same track provides an opportunity to record track geometry degradation. The obtained information is fed back to the track maintenance section to implement necessary steps.\nSeveral types of track faults are detected by measuring the acceleration of bogies. Weston et al.\ndemonstrated track irregularity monitoring by using bogie-mounted sensors . Alfi et al. proposed a technique to estimate long wavelength track irregularities from on-board measurements . If track\nfaults are detected using car-body mounted sensors, it is easier to perform the condition monitoring of track irregularities. The distinctive signal of track faults is hidden in car-body vibrations, and thus\nsignal processing of the acceleration measured in-cabin is necessary to detect the track faults.\nTsunashima et al. demonstrated the possibility of estimating the track geometry of Shinkansen tracks using only car-body motions . A Kalman filter was applied to estimate the track irregularity Tsunashima et al. developed a system that attempted to identify vertical and lateral track irregularities by using accelerometers placed on the car-body of in-service vehicles . Furthermore,\n(a microphone). An approach was tested to detect squats by listening to rolling noise using microphones . Odashima et al. demonstrated the possibility of estimating the track irregularities of conventional railway tracks by using only car-body acceleration . The Kalman filter-based estimationFigure 1 presents an overview of the track condition monitoring system. The system inand diagnosis software for identifying track conditions from the data.condition diagnosis software. The results of the diagnosis are fed back to the infrastructure providers where they are used to help create maintenance plans, select work locations, and assign work priorities.Figure 2 shows a photograph of the compact on-board sensing device used in the track condition monitoring system . The device consists of an accelerometer and rate gyroscope for detecting\ntrack errors, a global navigation satellite system (GNSS) receiver for detecting the train location and\nspeed, and a sensor interface for feeding the signals from the sensors to the computer.The system is battery-powered and conducts continuous measurements for up to six hours,\nand thus measurements are simply obtained by placing it in a car. Measurements are constantly obtained if it is powered by a source on the car. Measurement data are stored into an on-board storage device. Furthermore, the device is equipped with a function to automatically transmit measured data from the on-board storage device to a server via a mobile phone network. The device is further\nequipped with a microphone, and thus, it is also possible to “listen” for corrugation and diagnose either via a mobile phone network or via writing to external media. The diagnostic results produced\nchannels via smartphones or tablet computers. Railway operators use the information to establish the\ntrack maintenance priorities, and thereby facilitate the maintenance planning and work.\nAdditionally, the real-time measurement of vehicle vibrations during in-service operation allows for rapid response, such as emergency track inspection and maintenance, in situations in which vehicle\nvibration observations detect irregularly large deviations from standard control values. Thus, the use of deterioration or other track irregularities, and thereby enables infrastructure providers to conductTrack irregularity inspection includes vertical rail profile, lateral alignment, gauge, cross-level,\ntwist and dipped joint, and corrugation as shown in Figure 3. In the developed monitoring system,\nthe detection of track faults for vertical, lateral alignment, and cross-level is possible by usingof derailments. Thus, they are among the most important items that are monitored. Vehicle vibrations are strongly correlated with track irregularities, and thus the magnitude of vehicle vibrations is\nan effective means for assessing general track condition trends. Thus, sections of track over whichTo analyse the effects of railway track deterioration on car-body vibrations, we performed a railway vehicle travel simulation using SIMPACK, a multibody dynamics software package.\nThe model used for the simulation was a single conventional railway vehicle, the parameters for\nwhich are shown in Table 1. Figure 4 shows the model used in the simulation.The model consists of seven rigid bodies, one car body, two bogies, and four wheelsets,\neach having six degrees of freedom. Thus, 42 degrees of freedom exist in the model. It is necessary to connect each rigid body with an appropriate joint such that the vehicle exhibits a realistic motion.\nOne car-body, two bogies, and four wheelsets were connected by spring and damper elements.\nUsing this vehicle model, we calculated the vertical acceleration, lateral acceleration, and roll rate above the centre of the front bogie at the car body. This simulation study is carried out based on the\nstraight track. Alignment irregularity in curved track is not considered in this paper but should beTrack irregularities can be used as an index for managing track conditions. The types of\ntrack irregularities include longitudinal level irregularities that indicate vertical rail displacement,\nalignment irregularities that indicate lateral rail displacement, and cross level irregularities that indicate a difference in the elevation of the left and right rails. Because a high degree of correlation exists\nbetween these track irregularities and car-body vibrations, the magnitude of car-body vibrations can be an effective method to determine track conditions . The track-condition monitoring system can\nto detect any longitudinal level irregularities, alignment irregularities, and cross level irregularities.\nTo identify different types of track faults by using machine-learning techniques, it is necessary to extract the features of each type of track irregularity from the car-body vibrations that occur when travelling on a faulty track. The data obtained by learning the extracted features can be used to construct a training model. Subsequently, if unknown car-body vibration data are input to the model,\nthe type of track irregularity and its degradation level can be identified.\nAs shown in Figure 5, we created a baseline track geometry for an assumed regional railway line and a track geometry with increased track irregularities. We subsequently performed a travel\nsimulation by using a track for which all the longitudinal level irregularities, alignment irregularities,\nand cross level irregularities were within the normal range, and also by using a track for which one type of irregularity was abnormal. Degraded track is generated by the power spectral density of track\nwhere the standard deviation becomes twice as large as the normal track.
