The developed fault diagnosis method for train suspension systems, therefore, must be guaranteed to be immune to changes resulting from the track irregularities and wheel wear before being put into use.

In the first phase (data preprocessing), a strategy of adding Gaussian white noise (GWN-strategy) is applied to the original signal, making the diagnostic method be immune to the interference caused by track irregularities. In the second phase (training dataset establishment), an EST-strategy is proposed to improve the robustness of the diagnostic network against wheel wear. In the third phase (training and recognition), a 1DCNN-based fault diagnostic network of high-speed train suspension systems is built.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "article4pdf", "section": "ROOT", "level": 0, "chunk_id": 77, "year": "2000"}}

In addition, the field tracking data of a CRH3 train running on a highspeed railway line are used to further verify the effectiveness of the 1DCNN method. The test results show that the method has the potential to be applied in the field of railway engineering.This paper ends with the following notes.

{"text": "trained DL algorithm is extremely sensitive to the vehicle speed because the axlebox acceleration caused by different suspension faults varies at different vehicle speeds. Therefore, during on-board monitoring, the suspension status can be determined by obtaining the axlebox acceleration at a constant speed (e.g., 200 km/h or 250 km/h). However, to achieve real-time monitoring, more velocity conditions need to be further analyzed.
