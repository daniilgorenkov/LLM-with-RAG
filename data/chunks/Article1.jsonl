In this paper, a new defect detection method called empirical wavelet transform was investigated for wheel-bearing of train. Real vibration signals were collected from the wheel-bearings in maintenance workshop. To verify the effectiveness of the EWT method, this paper also provides the analysis results in different fault cases (i.e., outer race fault, roller fault, and the compound fault of outer race and roller).", "metadata": {"doc_id": "Article1", "section": "ROOT", "level": 0, "chunk_id": 38, "year": "1998"}}
{"text": "vides the analysis results in different fault cases (i.e., outer race fault, roller fault, and the compound fault of outer race and roller). Moreover, some problems also exist in the empirical wavelet transform. For example, how to segment the spectrum adaptively is still needed to be studied. More investigations focused on the EWT methods and the application in fault diagnosis would be carried out in the future.## **Acknowledgment**The author would like to express heartfelt appreciation to Dr. Gilles for his research.
