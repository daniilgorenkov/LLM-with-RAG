Langnebäck pointed out that systems\napplied to vehicles for detecting damage on the vehicle components are quite expensive,since sensors are required in all vehicles. Therefore, this method becomes economicallyby the damage to be identified. In addition, the substantial number of existing vehiclestechnology for detecting damage in each of them. In summary, despite the high precision for monitoring defective wheels, these on-board systems require a high installation cost to\nIn a wayside monitoring system, the wheel-rail contact interface plays a significant role.\nAt this point, the dynamic forces of wheel-rail interaction are established, which allows the acquisition of relevant information about various factors inherent to the traffic conditions .\nAlthough these components represent a high maintenance cost, serious accidents with high economic losses and possible human injuries can be avoided.

In the research study by Cai et al. , the mechanism\nof polygon formation on metro wheels was investigated based on experimental measurements and numerical simulations. Further, in the study by Peng , the mechanisms of\nOOR formation on wheels were presented considering different wear prediction models.\nConsidering recent technological advances, it is now possible to develop and implement automatic methodologies for detecting and identifying damage in different systems [15–17] for railway applications. With the application of these intelligent techniques, it\nis not intended to completely replace the visual inspections already used for many decades,\nbut rather, the creation of a compatible procedure. Traditional visual inspection and control techniques are expensive, occur at intervals, and are prone to errors, it is important to\nmotivate the widespread use of Structural Integrity Monitoring (SIE) systems, especially in\nrecent infrastructures or in systems of high value to society, as in the case of railway systems . Thus, it is essential to develop automatic methodologies for detecting different Despite the widespread research on railway defect detection, to the knowledge of the authors, the reported literature on automatic wheel polygonization identification has been limited so far. Therefore, taking advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies, it isan early stage. The detection of polygonized wheels is largely carried out using accelerometers mounted on the vehicle. The parametric power spectral estimation and adaptive chirpresults, but with flaws in polygonization detection in the early stages [19–21].\nOn the other hand, previous studies have shown very good results using waysidelearning in detecting defects in railway vehicle wheels, namely wheel flat detections .\nThis type of methodology usually presents the following steps: (i) feature extractionusing data from accelerations or strains measured on the track, (ii) feature modelingand operational variations, (iii) data fusion to merge different features and/or sensors information, and (iv) features discrimination to classify the defects. The studies carriedidentifying singular irregularities on the wheel surface (i.e., wheel flat). In this context, itcomprehensive number of damages, namely the ones that may occur along the entire Several methods have been used for feature extraction, which converts time-series\ndata into more condensed information, allowing damage to be more easily observed.\nSymbolic data, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) [15–17], principal component analysis\n(PCA) , and autoregressive models [15–17] are examples of effective techniques for\nextracting damage-sensitive features for both static and dynamic monitoring. In timedomain applications where the measured quantity is acceleration, autoregressive modelson the system response, with the model parameters reflecting the properties of the system regardless of the sources of excitations. CWT and PCA have been developed over decades in different applications, in both time and frequency domains with various sensors. Despite this, they present some limitations, PCA does not consider the non-linearity of the data\nand CWT adds excess redundancy to the data, and it has a high computational cost, so For feature fusion, several algorithms, including neighborhood-preserving embedding\n(NPE) , neural networks , Mahalanobis distance , manifold learning methods , and kernel-based methods , have been recently employed. This data fusioninformation. Due to its simplicity and ability to reduce multivariate data, Mahalanobis\nRecent approaches based on machine learning have been applied for feature classification to differentiate a healthy wheel from a defective one . Typically, two different approaches are used: (i) unsupervised methods, in which models are trained using labeled data under the supervision of training data, such as k-means , self-organizing maps\n(SOM) , and cluster analysis; or (ii) supervised methods, in which models are not supervised using training datasets, such as Naive Bayes classifiers and k-Nearest Neighbor\nThis work aims: (i) to develop an unsupervised methodology to identify polygonized\nwheels; (ii) to evaluate the performance of different feature extraction techniques concerning their sensitivity to the detection of wheel polygonization, specifically those based on\nautoregressive exogenous models (ARX) and continuous wavelet transforms (CWT); (iii) towheel defect detection system. The unsupervised methodology to identify polygonized wheels consists of five phases: (i) data acquisition, (ii) feature extraction, (iii) feature The acquired track responses are influenced by parameters such as speed, irregularities, and load types. In this sense, different simulations of realistic scenarios of dynamicconditions. On the other hand, to overcome some unpredictable oscillations in the measured responses and consequent failures in damage detection, some options can be taken.\nIn more complex structures, such as bridges and viaducts, there should be a greater susceptibility to damage when compared to areas of track sections on the foundation ground. If the structures are damaged, they may camouflage or cause false warnings. In a practical context, the use of sensors in an area of the track less prone to damage and where vibrationmethodology. Aligned on these assumptions, the location of the sensors was chosen on aAfter defining the AI approach for identifying wheel polygonization, two distinguished feature extraction methods, namely ARX and CWT, are compared. To avoid\nfalse alarm situations caused by environmental and operational effects, the latent variable method Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied. To reduce the volume of extracted data while retaining the most relevant information, as well as improve the ability to characterize the measured phenomenon, the data are merged using the Mahalanobis distance. As\na final step, an outlier analysis is employed to automatically distinguish a healthy wheel It should be highlighted that wheel flat identification was developed by Mosleh et al. ,\nwho demonstrated that the methodology is able to identify wheel flats. The validation of the proposed AI-based methodology herein, considering a polygonal wheel, is a clear step forward\nin terms of the proposed methodology’s effectiveness, allowing for a complete implementation**2.

The outcome of this stepDI identifies a healthy or a defective wheel; a statistical confidence boundary (CB) isIn this study, the features are extracted based on autoregressive models with exogenous inputs (ARX) and continuous wavelet transform (CWT) models.

The ARX autoregressive model considers the predictive behavior of the system at a specific location, considering its history at the same\npoint and the predictive response at other measurement locations, being defined by the### xj = ∑ aixj−i +### ∑ bkyj−k + ε j (1)where xj, yj, and ε j are the output, input, as well as error term of the model at the signal value j . Moreover, ai, bk, ma, and mb are the parameters and the orders of the output and Initially, it is difficult to determine the most appropriate ARX model order. The key issue is that higher-order models could better match the data, but they may not generalize\nto other datasets. Otherwise, a low-order model is unlikely to capture the underlying physical system response. Several authors have noted the difficulty of defining a unique order for ARX models. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is reported to be one of the most effective optimization techniques . Based on the exchange between fit accuracy and the number of estimated parameters, AIC measures the goodness-of-fit of an estimatedparameters, respectively, and ε is the average sum-of-square residual ( SSR ) errors. To find out an optimum order, one should examine a wide range of orders and choose the orderStudies conducted by Li et al. showed good results in gearbox fault detection.\nCWT produces a two-dimensional set of coefficients from the analyzed signal. Although the Fourier transforms typically use sine waves as the basis for decomposition, other functionscan be selected for the wavelet shape due to signal properties. Two parameters define wavelet analysis: scale and translation. The CWT ( T ) of the signal x ( t ) is determined aswhere a and b are the scale and translation parameters, and ψ [∗] is the complex conjugate of the mother wavelet T that involves a continuous function in both time and frequency domains.\nAfter the implementation of a CWT on the evaluated signals, a PCA is performed\nfollowed by the extraction of four statistical parameters, resulting in significant data compression . Based on the p -by- q matrix X containing the extracted CWT features from the original signal evaluated by each sensor, where p is the measurement points number and q is the wavelets coefficients number, the principal components can be determinedwhere Ss represents the scores matrix, and T is a q -by- q orthonormal linear transformation matrix. In addition, four statistical parameters are extracted from the scores, Ss, including the root mean square (RMS), standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. Thus, a matrix p -by- q is transformed into a k -by- q matrix, where k equals 4. Consequently, a total of k × qenvironmental and operational variations (EOVs). For example, in damage detection, itare mostly sensitive to damage . Therefore, implementing a latent variable method,\nnamely the PCA, may efficiently reduce EOVs influences, without requiring the direct measurement of those effects. According to Bro and Smilde , PCA is a powerful and versatile method capable of providing an overview of complex multivariate data. PCA can be used to find and quantify patterns, generate new hypotheses, detect outliers, or find\nBy considering a m -by- f matrix X, taking into account features extracted from the dynamic responses, where m represents the train passages and f represents the number of\nfeatures extracted from sensors (i.e., k × q ), a transformation to another set of f features, Ss,\nis obtained by considering Equation (4). Considering the baseline condition, the covariance matrix ( C ) of the features is related to the covariance matrix of the scores Λ, as follows:where, Λ and T are matrices calculated by the singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix C . The columns of T are the eigenvectors and the diagonal matrix Λ, including\nthe eigenvalues of the matrix C in descending order. Thus, the eigenvalues stored in Λ areIt is possible to divide matrix Λ into two matrices with the first n eigenvalues and the remaining f-n eigenvalues. Determining the number of n -components is one of the\nchallenges in multivariate data interpretation. In this research study, n -components are\ndiscarded when the cumulative percentage of variance reaches 80% . Once n\nhas been selected, Equation (4) can be used to calculate the f-n components of matrix S. The transformation matrix T [ˆ] is constructed by the remaining f-n columns of matrix T . Using\nthe following function, the f-n components can be remapped to the main space:where, FPCA is m -by- f matrix of PCA features which is less sensitive to EOVs. Every sensorindex definition, is easy to implement and fast to process . For each simulation, the MD is considered to calculate a damage index (DI). Several damage identification studies haveDI . The MD is a well-known distance metric because it measures the distance\nbetween two points in a feature space containing two or more variables . Furthermore,\nit considers correlations between variables and does not depend on the scale of the features.\nIt can merge features from multiple sensors by performing data fusion. Mahalanobis\ndistance (namely here as DI ) is calculated by the following function:in which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−] , and is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The covariance matrix and mean vector intend to incorporate the baseline simulation. Based on the data derived from the\ndamaged system, a new observation would be far from the average of normal conditions.\nMahalanobis distances are calculated for each sensor and simulation. A matrix containing m Mahalanobis distances for i sensors is obtained from the above calculations.To automatically monitor train wheel conditions, the methodology performs outlier analysis.

A Gaussian distribution can be used to approximate the Mahalanobis distance, and statistical thresholds can be used to analyze outliers. By considering a mean value and standard deviation σ of the baseline feature vector, as well as the significance level α, itconsequently, when DI is equal to or higher than CB, a feature is considered to be an outlier.In the present research, the Laagrss freight train composed of five wagons is studied.\nAccording to the UIC classification, it can reach a top speed of 120 km/h .

Therefore,In real conditions, the wheels are not entirely smooth and have imperfections. Despite\ntheir small size, these out-of-roundness irregularities can cause extreme variations in the wheelrail contact forces, producing vibrations on the train and track components. A periodic radial\ntread irregularity around the wheel circumference characterizes the wheel polygonization.\nAccording to Peng , for wheel polygonization, the irregularity amplitudes should be higher than 0. mm. Inherent to polygonization, some parameters can geometrically characterize the phenomenon, such as the varying wavelengths (λ) in the function of the harmonic order (θ)Two groups of polygonal wheel profiles are generated for the numerical simulations,\none for undamaged scenarios and another for damaged scenarios, based on real wheel measurements, the irregularity amplitude spectra of which are presented in Figure 6.**Figure 6.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) ( **a** ) initial polygonalFor the first group of profiles, the measurement data obtained by Johansson et al.\nfor new wheels with wavelengths comprising 20 harmonics were used .

Therefore, in addition to 113 analyses with healthy wheels, 30 scenarios are considered with three semi-imperfection cases, including: (i) the right wheel on the front wheelset of the first wagon, (ii) the left wheel of the rear wheelset of the third wagon; (iii) the right wheel of the rear wheelset of the fifth wagon.

By comparing the results from Figure 11a,b, it is evident that the acceleration variation for the healthy wheel\nis between − 1. to 2. m/s , while the defective one changes between − 70 to 100 m/s .**Figure 11.** Acceleration time-series on position 1 for ( **a** ) healthy wheel and wheel with semiimperfection profile, ( **b** ) damaged wheel.As the first step in the automatic damage detection method, damage-sensitive features are extracted from dynamic responses. As mentioned in Section 2.1, the ARX and CWT\nmodels are implemented and their performances as feature extractors are compared.\nTo establish a suitable ARX model order, AIC values are ascendingly ranked from\n1 to 70. An average AIC function is presented in Figure 12 based on 113 baseline analyses.\nIt is evident from this figure that after model order 40, the AIC values tend to stabilize,\nshowing that higher orders do not provide additional information. Therefore, the ARX models’ input and output orders are set to 40, and a total of 80 features are extracted.

Langnebäck pointed out that systems\napplied to vehicles for detecting damage on the vehicle components are quite expensive,since sensors are required in all vehicles. Therefore, this method becomes economicallyby the damage to be identified. In addition, the substantial number of existing vehiclestechnology for detecting damage in each of them. In summary, despite the high precision for monitoring defective wheels, these on-board systems require a high installation cost to\nIn a wayside monitoring system, the wheel-rail contact interface plays a significant role.\nAt this point, the dynamic forces of wheel-rail interaction are established, which allows the acquisition of relevant information about various factors inherent to the traffic conditions .\nAlthough these components represent a high maintenance cost, serious accidents with high economic losses and possible human injuries can be avoided. Regarding railway safety, wheel defects are one of the main causes of accidents , causing interruptionsreliability. Furthermore, these defects promote negative effects on both the vehicle and\nFurthermore, wheels deteriorate over time due to wear and fatigue, which may develop various defects such as polygonization, flats and shelling, altering the wheel-rail contact characteristics and, consequently, causing greater impact forces .

In the research study by Cai et al. , the mechanism\nof polygon formation on metro wheels was investigated based on experimental measurements and numerical simulations. Further, in the study by Peng , the mechanisms of\nOOR formation on wheels were presented considering different wear prediction models.\nConsidering recent technological advances, it is now possible to develop and implement automatic methodologies for detecting and identifying damage in different systems [15–17] for railway applications. With the application of these intelligent techniques, it\nis not intended to completely replace the visual inspections already used for many decades,\nbut rather, the creation of a compatible procedure. Traditional visual inspection and control techniques are expensive, occur at intervals, and are prone to errors, it is important to\nmotivate the widespread use of Structural Integrity Monitoring (SIE) systems, especially in\nrecent infrastructures or in systems of high value to society, as in the case of railway systems . Thus, it is essential to develop automatic methodologies for detecting different Despite the widespread research on railway defect detection, to the knowledge of the authors, the reported literature on automatic wheel polygonization identification has been limited so far. Therefore, taking advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies, it isan early stage. The detection of polygonized wheels is largely carried out using accelerometers mounted on the vehicle. The parametric power spectral estimation and adaptive chirpresults, but with flaws in polygonization detection in the early stages [19–21].\nOn the other hand, previous studies have shown very good results using waysidelearning in detecting defects in railway vehicle wheels, namely wheel flat detections .\nThis type of methodology usually presents the following steps: (i) feature extractionusing data from accelerations or strains measured on the track, (ii) feature modelingand operational variations, (iii) data fusion to merge different features and/or sensors information, and (iv) features discrimination to classify the defects. The studies carriedidentifying singular irregularities on the wheel surface (i.e., wheel flat). In this context, itcomprehensive number of damages, namely the ones that may occur along the entire Several methods have been used for feature extraction, which converts time-series\ndata into more condensed information, allowing damage to be more easily observed.\nSymbolic data, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) [15–17], principal component analysis\n(PCA) , and autoregressive models [15–17] are examples of effective techniques for\nextracting damage-sensitive features for both static and dynamic monitoring. In timedomain applications where the measured quantity is acceleration, autoregressive modelson the system response, with the model parameters reflecting the properties of the system regardless of the sources of excitations. CWT and PCA have been developed over decades in different applications, in both time and frequency domains with various sensors. Despite this, they present some limitations, PCA does not consider the non-linearity of the data\nand CWT adds excess redundancy to the data, and it has a high computational cost, so For feature fusion, several algorithms, including neighborhood-preserving embedding\n(NPE) , neural networks , Mahalanobis distance , manifold learning methods , and kernel-based methods , have been recently employed. This data fusioninformation. Due to its simplicity and ability to reduce multivariate data, Mahalanobis\nRecent approaches based on machine learning have been applied for feature classification to differentiate a healthy wheel from a defective one . Typically, two different approaches are used: (i) unsupervised methods, in which models are trained using labeled data under the supervision of training data, such as k-means , self-organizing maps\n(SOM) , and cluster analysis; or (ii) supervised methods, in which models are not supervised using training datasets, such as Naive Bayes classifiers and k-Nearest Neighbor\nThis work aims: (i) to develop an unsupervised methodology to identify polygonized\nwheels; (ii) to evaluate the performance of different feature extraction techniques concerning their sensitivity to the detection of wheel polygonization, specifically those based on\nautoregressive exogenous models (ARX) and continuous wavelet transforms (CWT); (iii) towheel defect detection system. The unsupervised methodology to identify polygonized wheels consists of five phases: (i) data acquisition, (ii) feature extraction, (iii) feature The acquired track responses are influenced by parameters such as speed, irregularities, and load types. In this sense, different simulations of realistic scenarios of dynamicconditions. On the other hand, to overcome some unpredictable oscillations in the measured responses and consequent failures in damage detection, some options can be taken.\nIn more complex structures, such as bridges and viaducts, there should be a greater susceptibility to damage when compared to areas of track sections on the foundation ground. If the structures are damaged, they may camouflage or cause false warnings. In a practical context, the use of sensors in an area of the track less prone to damage and where vibrationmethodology. Aligned on these assumptions, the location of the sensors was chosen on aAfter defining the AI approach for identifying wheel polygonization, two distinguished feature extraction methods, namely ARX and CWT, are compared. To avoid\nfalse alarm situations caused by environmental and operational effects, the latent variable method Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied. To reduce the volume of extracted data while retaining the most relevant information, as well as improve the ability to characterize the measured phenomenon, the data are merged using the Mahalanobis distance. As\na final step, an outlier analysis is employed to automatically distinguish a healthy wheel It should be highlighted that wheel flat identification was developed by Mosleh et al. ,\nwho demonstrated that the methodology is able to identify wheel flats.

The outcome of this stepDI identifies a healthy or a defective wheel; a statistical confidence boundary (CB) isIn this study, the features are extracted based on autoregressive models with exogenous inputs (ARX) and continuous wavelet transform (CWT) models.

The ARX autoregressive model considers the predictive behavior of the system at a specific location, considering its history at the same\npoint and the predictive response at other measurement locations, being defined by the### xj = ∑ aixj−i +### ∑ bkyj−k + ε j (1)where xj, yj, and ε j are the output, input, as well as error term of the model at the signal value j . Moreover, ai, bk, ma, and mb are the parameters and the orders of the output and Initially, it is difficult to determine the most appropriate ARX model order. The key issue is that higher-order models could better match the data, but they may not generalize\nto other datasets. Otherwise, a low-order model is unlikely to capture the underlying physical system response. Several authors have noted the difficulty of defining a unique order for ARX models. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is reported to be one of the most effective optimization techniques . Based on the exchange between fit accuracy and the number of estimated parameters, AIC measures the goodness-of-fit of an estimatedparameters, respectively, and ε is the average sum-of-square residual ( SSR ) errors. To find out an optimum order, one should examine a wide range of orders and choose the orderStudies conducted by Li et al. showed good results in gearbox fault detection.\nCWT produces a two-dimensional set of coefficients from the analyzed signal. Although the Fourier transforms typically use sine waves as the basis for decomposition, other functionscan be selected for the wavelet shape due to signal properties. Two parameters define wavelet analysis: scale and translation. The CWT ( T ) of the signal x ( t ) is determined aswhere a and b are the scale and translation parameters, and ψ [∗] is the complex conjugate of the mother wavelet T that involves a continuous function in both time and frequency domains.\nAfter the implementation of a CWT on the evaluated signals, a PCA is performed\nfollowed by the extraction of four statistical parameters, resulting in significant data compression . Based on the p -by- q matrix X containing the extracted CWT features from the original signal evaluated by each sensor, where p is the measurement points number and q is the wavelets coefficients number, the principal components can be determinedwhere Ss represents the scores matrix, and T is a q -by- q orthonormal linear transformation matrix. In addition, four statistical parameters are extracted from the scores, Ss, including the root mean square (RMS), standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. Thus, a matrix p -by- q is transformed into a k -by- q matrix, where k equals 4. Consequently, a total of k × qenvironmental and operational variations (EOVs). For example, in damage detection, itare mostly sensitive to damage . Therefore, implementing a latent variable method,\nnamely the PCA, may efficiently reduce EOVs influences, without requiring the direct measurement of those effects. According to Bro and Smilde , PCA is a powerful and versatile method capable of providing an overview of complex multivariate data. PCA can be used to find and quantify patterns, generate new hypotheses, detect outliers, or find\nBy considering a m -by- f matrix X, taking into account features extracted from the dynamic responses, where m represents the train passages and f represents the number of\nfeatures extracted from sensors (i.e., k × q ), a transformation to another set of f features, Ss,\nis obtained by considering Equation (4). Considering the baseline condition, the covariance matrix ( C ) of the features is related to the covariance matrix of the scores Λ, as follows:where, Λ and T are matrices calculated by the singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix C . The columns of T are the eigenvectors and the diagonal matrix Λ, including\nthe eigenvalues of the matrix C in descending order. Thus, the eigenvalues stored in Λ areIt is possible to divide matrix Λ into two matrices with the first n eigenvalues and the remaining f-n eigenvalues. Determining the number of n -components is one of the\nchallenges in multivariate data interpretation. In this research study, n -components are\ndiscarded when the cumulative percentage of variance reaches 80% . Once n\nhas been selected, Equation (4) can be used to calculate the f-n components of matrix S. The transformation matrix T [ˆ] is constructed by the remaining f-n columns of matrix T . Using\nthe following function, the f-n components can be remapped to the main space:where, FPCA is m -by- f matrix of PCA features which is less sensitive to EOVs. Every sensorindex definition, is easy to implement and fast to process . For each simulation, the MD is considered to calculate a damage index (DI). Several damage identification studies haveDI . The MD is a well-known distance metric because it measures the distance\nbetween two points in a feature space containing two or more variables . Furthermore,\nit considers correlations between variables and does not depend on the scale of the features.\nIt can merge features from multiple sensors by performing data fusion. Mahalanobis\ndistance (namely here as DI ) is calculated by the following function:in which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−] , and is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The covariance matrix and mean vector intend to incorporate the baseline simulation. Based on the data derived from the\ndamaged system, a new observation would be far from the average of normal conditions.\nMahalanobis distances are calculated for each sensor and simulation. A matrix containing m Mahalanobis distances for i sensors is obtained from the above calculations.To automatically monitor train wheel conditions, the methodology performs outlier analysis. In Meixedo et al. and Mosleh et al. , this tool proved to be very efficient in\nclassifying the data as being related to a scenario with or without damage. Mahalanobisspace. A Gaussian distribution can be used to approximate the Mahalanobis distance, and statistical thresholds can be used to analyze outliers. By considering a mean value and standard deviation σ of the baseline feature vector, as well as the significance level α, itconsequently, when DI is equal to or higher than CB, a feature is considered to be an outlier.In the present research, the Laagrss freight train composed of five wagons is studied.\nAccording to the UIC classification, it can reach a top speed of 120 km/h .

Therefore,In real conditions, the wheels are not entirely smooth and have imperfections. Despite\ntheir small size, these out-of-roundness irregularities can cause extreme variations in the wheelrail contact forces, producing vibrations on the train and track components. A periodic radial\ntread irregularity around the wheel circumference characterizes the wheel polygonization.\nAccording to Peng , for wheel polygonization, the irregularity amplitudes should be higher than 0. mm. Inherent to polygonization, some parameters can geometrically characterize the phenomenon, such as the varying wavelengths (λ) in the function of the harmonic order (θ)Two groups of polygonal wheel profiles are generated for the numerical simulations,\none for undamaged scenarios and another for damaged scenarios, based on real wheel measurements, the irregularity amplitude spectra of which are presented in Figure 6.**Figure 6.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) ( **a** ) initial polygonalFor the first group of profiles, the measurement data obtained by Johansson et al.\nfor new wheels with wavelengths comprising 20 harmonics were used .

The wheel pr i s are characterized by the\nwavelengths in the first 30 harmonics, with the 6th to 8th harmonic orders being dominant.\nThen, different irregularity wheel profiles are generated based on the sum of sine### w ( xw ) = ∑ Aθ sin [ψ] [θ]where Aθ is the amplitude of the sine function for each wavelength, which is calculated bywhere, as wre f = 1 µm. The wheel irregularity level ( Lw ) values are selected based on the\nirregularity spectrums of Figure 6, for both cases: initial polygonization or polygonal damage .

A graphical representation of the numerical model is shown in Figure 9. Note that the first wheel of the first wagon on the right side isA series of accelerometers are mounted along the track to detect a polygonized wheel.\nAccording to the results demonstrated in Mosleh et al. , the location of the most promising sensors for obtaining good results is on the rail. However, the possibility of placing the sensors on the sleepers was also analyzed, since their installation is much easier. Using a virtual wayside monitoring system, acceleration measurements were\nevaluated from 16 positions, as shown in Figure 10.

Once validated,Based on several speeds, loading schemes, and unevenness profiles of the rail, Table 3\nsummarizes the simulations of the undamaged and damaged scenarios. Baseline scenariosconsider vehicle speeds between 40 and 120 km/h, and four unevenness profiles are considered for rail irregularities . A total of six types of loading schemes are\nconsidered: (i) a fully loaded train, (ii) a half-loaded train, (iii) an empty train, and trains with an unbalanced load in the transversal and longitudinal directions, namely (iv) UNB1,\n(v) UNB2, and (vi) UNB3. In accordance with UIC loading guidelines , differentgravity is longitudinally and transversally offset. For baseline scenarios, 113 simulationswheels with initial polygonal profiles. Therefore, in addition to 113 analyses with healthy wheels, 30 scenarios are considered with three semi-imperfection cases, including: (i) the right wheel on the front wheelset of the first wagon, (ii) the left wheel of the rear wheelset of the third wagon; (iii) the right wheel of the rear wheelset of the fifth wagon.

By comparing the results from Figure 11a,b, it is evident that the acceleration variation for the healthy wheel\nis between − 1. to 2. m/s , while the defective one changes between − 70 to 100 m/s .**Figure 11.** Acceleration time-series on position 1 for ( **a** ) healthy wheel and wheel with semiimperfection profile, ( **b** ) damaged wheel.As the first step in the automatic damage detection method, damage-sensitive features are extracted from dynamic responses. As mentioned in Section 2.1, the ARX and CWT\nmodels are implemented and their performances as feature extractors are compared.\nTo establish a suitable ARX model order, AIC values are ascendingly ranked from\n1 to 70. An average AIC function is presented in Figure 12 based on 113 baseline analyses.\nIt is evident from this figure that after model order 40, the AIC values tend to stabilize,\nshowing that higher orders do not provide additional information. Therefore, the ARX models’ input and output orders are set to 40, and a total of 80 features are extracted. The\nsensor installed at position 5 ( yj in Equation (1)) is used as output, while each of the otherof the features extracted by the ARX models is higher than the CWT method.

Overall, the presenceregardless of the technique applied. Thus, the feature normalization step is implemented**Figure 13.** Feature extraction for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–feature 3, ( **b** ) ARX–feature 36, ( **c** ) CWT–featureout to obtain indicators that are more sensitive to damage and less sensitive to EOVs. The Latent Variable Method PCA is applied for data normalization.

Note that the PCA matrices have the same dimensions as the feature extraction step In Figure 14, the same four features shown in Figure 13 for sensor 1 are shown after\nimplementing PCA for all undamaged and damaged scenarios. During the modeling process, components with a cumulative percentage of variances higher than 80% are discarded. Therefore, the number of discarded rows is seventeen and two for CWT-doublePCA-based and ARX-PCA-based methods, respectively. The results obtained are quite\ndifferent depending on the method applied as a feature extractor. A reduction in theobserved in Figure 14a,b.

Therefore, in the first stage, Mahalanobis\ndistance transfers 468 CWT-double-PCA-based parameters into one column (173 × 1) for each sensor and train passage. At the same time, 80 ARX-PCA-based parameters are\nconverted to a single damage-sensitive feature (173 × 1). Figure 15 demonstrates theARX-PCA and CWT-double-PCA considering sensor 1. It is possible to observe that this process significantly improves damage detection sensitivity for both approaches.**Figure 15.** Features fusion for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based, ( **b** ) CWT–double–PCA–based.Afterwards, in the second stage, all sensor information is merged to improve the sensitivity to the damage even more.

Further, in the study by Peng , the mechanisms of\nOOR formation on wheels were presented considering different wear prediction models.\nConsidering recent technological advances, it is now possible to develop and implement automatic methodologies for detecting and identifying damage in different systems [15–17] for railway applications. With the application of these intelligent techniques, it\nis not intended to completely replace the visual inspections already used for many decades,\nbut rather, the creation of a compatible procedure. Traditional visual inspection and control techniques are expensive, occur at intervals, and are prone to errors, it is important to\nmotivate the widespread use of Structural Integrity Monitoring (SIE) systems, especially in\nrecent infrastructures or in systems of high value to society, as in the case of railway systems . Thus, it is essential to develop automatic methodologies for detecting different Despite the widespread research on railway defect detection, to the knowledge of the authors, the reported literature on automatic wheel polygonization identification has been limited so far. Therefore, taking advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies, it isan early stage. The detection of polygonized wheels is largely carried out using accelerometers mounted on the vehicle. The parametric power spectral estimation and adaptive chirpresults, but with flaws in polygonization detection in the early stages [19–21].\nOn the other hand, previous studies have shown very good results using waysidelearning in detecting defects in railway vehicle wheels, namely wheel flat detections .\nThis type of methodology usually presents the following steps: (i) feature extractionusing data from accelerations or strains measured on the track, (ii) feature modelingand operational variations, (iii) data fusion to merge different features and/or sensors information, and (iv) features discrimination to classify the defects. The studies carriedidentifying singular irregularities on the wheel surface (i.e., wheel flat). In this context, itcomprehensive number of damages, namely the ones that may occur along the entire Several methods have been used for feature extraction, which converts time-series\ndata into more condensed information, allowing damage to be more easily observed.\nSymbolic data, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) [15–17], principal component analysis\n(PCA) , and autoregressive models [15–17] are examples of effective techniques for\nextracting damage-sensitive features for both static and dynamic monitoring. In timedomain applications where the measured quantity is acceleration, autoregressive modelson the system response, with the model parameters reflecting the properties of the system regardless of the sources of excitations. CWT and PCA have been developed over decades in different applications, in both time and frequency domains with various sensors. Despite this, they present some limitations, PCA does not consider the non-linearity of the data\nand CWT adds excess redundancy to the data, and it has a high computational cost, so For feature fusion, several algorithms, including neighborhood-preserving embedding\n(NPE) , neural networks , Mahalanobis distance , manifold learning methods , and kernel-based methods , have been recently employed.

Due to its simplicity and ability to reduce multivariate data, Mahalanobis\nRecent approaches based on machine learning have been applied for feature classification to differentiate a healthy wheel from a defective one . Typically, two different approaches are used: (i) unsupervised methods, in which models are trained using labeled data under the supervision of training data, such as k-means , self-organizing maps\n(SOM) , and cluster analysis; or (ii) supervised methods, in which models are not supervised using training datasets, such as Naive Bayes classifiers and k-Nearest Neighbor\nThis work aims: (i) to develop an unsupervised methodology to identify polygonized\nwheels; (ii) to evaluate the performance of different feature extraction techniques concerning their sensitivity to the detection of wheel polygonization, specifically those based on\nautoregressive exogenous models (ARX) and continuous wavelet transforms (CWT); (iii) towheel defect detection system. The unsupervised methodology to identify polygonized wheels consists of five phases: (i) data acquisition, (ii) feature extraction, (iii) feature The acquired track responses are influenced by parameters such as speed, irregularities, and load types. In this sense, different simulations of realistic scenarios of dynamicconditions. On the other hand, to overcome some unpredictable oscillations in the measured responses and consequent failures in damage detection, some options can be taken.\nIn more complex structures, such as bridges and viaducts, there should be a greater susceptibility to damage when compared to areas of track sections on the foundation ground. If the structures are damaged, they may camouflage or cause false warnings. In a practical context, the use of sensors in an area of the track less prone to damage and where vibrationmethodology. Aligned on these assumptions, the location of the sensors was chosen on aAfter defining the AI approach for identifying wheel polygonization, two distinguished feature extraction methods, namely ARX and CWT, are compared. To avoid\nfalse alarm situations caused by environmental and operational effects, the latent variable method Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied. To reduce the volume of extracted data while retaining the most relevant information, as well as improve the ability to characterize the measured phenomenon, the data are merged using the Mahalanobis distance. As\na final step, an outlier analysis is employed to automatically distinguish a healthy wheel It should be highlighted that wheel flat identification was developed by Mosleh et al. ,\nwho demonstrated that the methodology is able to identify wheel flats.

The outcome of this stepDI identifies a healthy or a defective wheel; a statistical confidence boundary (CB) isIn this study, the features are extracted based on autoregressive models with exogenous inputs (ARX) and continuous wavelet transform (CWT) models.

The ARX autoregressive model considers the predictive behavior of the system at a specific location, considering its history at the same\npoint and the predictive response at other measurement locations, being defined by the### xj = ∑ aixj−i +### ∑ bkyj−k + ε j (1)where xj, yj, and ε j are the output, input, as well as error term of the model at the signal value j . Moreover, ai, bk, ma, and mb are the parameters and the orders of the output and Initially, it is difficult to determine the most appropriate ARX model order. The key issue is that higher-order models could better match the data, but they may not generalize\nto other datasets. Otherwise, a low-order model is unlikely to capture the underlying physical system response. Several authors have noted the difficulty of defining a unique order for ARX models. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is reported to be one of the most effective optimization techniques . Based on the exchange between fit accuracy and the number of estimated parameters, AIC measures the goodness-of-fit of an estimatedparameters, respectively, and ε is the average sum-of-square residual ( SSR ) errors. To find out an optimum order, one should examine a wide range of orders and choose the orderStudies conducted by Li et al. showed good results in gearbox fault detection.\nCWT produces a two-dimensional set of coefficients from the analyzed signal. Although the Fourier transforms typically use sine waves as the basis for decomposition, other functionscan be selected for the wavelet shape due to signal properties. Two parameters define wavelet analysis: scale and translation. The CWT ( T ) of the signal x ( t ) is determined aswhere a and b are the scale and translation parameters, and ψ [∗] is the complex conjugate of the mother wavelet T that involves a continuous function in both time and frequency domains.\nAfter the implementation of a CWT on the evaluated signals, a PCA is performed\nfollowed by the extraction of four statistical parameters, resulting in significant data compression . Based on the p -by- q matrix X containing the extracted CWT features from the original signal evaluated by each sensor, where p is the measurement points number and q is the wavelets coefficients number, the principal components can be determinedwhere Ss represents the scores matrix, and T is a q -by- q orthonormal linear transformation matrix. In addition, four statistical parameters are extracted from the scores, Ss, including the root mean square (RMS), standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. Thus, a matrix p -by- q is transformed into a k -by- q matrix, where k equals 4. Consequently, a total of k × qenvironmental and operational variations (EOVs). For example, in damage detection, itare mostly sensitive to damage . Therefore, implementing a latent variable method,\nnamely the PCA, may efficiently reduce EOVs influences, without requiring the direct measurement of those effects. According to Bro and Smilde , PCA is a powerful and versatile method capable of providing an overview of complex multivariate data. PCA can be used to find and quantify patterns, generate new hypotheses, detect outliers, or find\nBy considering a m -by- f matrix X, taking into account features extracted from the dynamic responses, where m represents the train passages and f represents the number of\nfeatures extracted from sensors (i.e., k × q ), a transformation to another set of f features, Ss,\nis obtained by considering Equation (4). Considering the baseline condition, the covariance matrix ( C ) of the features is related to the covariance matrix of the scores Λ, as follows:where, Λ and T are matrices calculated by the singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix C . The columns of T are the eigenvectors and the diagonal matrix Λ, including\nthe eigenvalues of the matrix C in descending order. Thus, the eigenvalues stored in Λ areIt is possible to divide matrix Λ into two matrices with the first n eigenvalues and the remaining f-n eigenvalues. Determining the number of n -components is one of the\nchallenges in multivariate data interpretation. In this research study, n -components are\ndiscarded when the cumulative percentage of variance reaches 80% . Once n\nhas been selected, Equation (4) can be used to calculate the f-n components of matrix S. The transformation matrix T [ˆ] is constructed by the remaining f-n columns of matrix T . Using\nthe following function, the f-n components can be remapped to the main space:where, FPCA is m -by- f matrix of PCA features which is less sensitive to EOVs. Every sensorindex definition, is easy to implement and fast to process . For each simulation, the MD is considered to calculate a damage index (DI). Several damage identification studies haveDI . The MD is a well-known distance metric because it measures the distance\nbetween two points in a feature space containing two or more variables . Furthermore,\nit considers correlations between variables and does not depend on the scale of the features.\nIt can merge features from multiple sensors by performing data fusion. Mahalanobis\ndistance (namely here as DI ) is calculated by the following function:in which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−] , and is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The covariance matrix and mean vector intend to incorporate the baseline simulation. Based on the data derived from the\ndamaged system, a new observation would be far from the average of normal conditions.\nMahalanobis distances are calculated for each sensor and simulation. A matrix containing m Mahalanobis distances for i sensors is obtained from the above calculations.To automatically monitor train wheel conditions, the methodology performs outlier analysis. In Meixedo et al. and Mosleh et al. , this tool proved to be very efficient in\nclassifying the data as being related to a scenario with or without damage. Mahalanobisspace. A Gaussian distribution can be used to approximate the Mahalanobis distance, and statistical thresholds can be used to analyze outliers. By considering a mean value and standard deviation σ of the baseline feature vector, as well as the significance level α, itconsequently, when DI is equal to or higher than CB, a feature is considered to be an outlier.In the present research, the Laagrss freight train composed of five wagons is studied.\nAccording to the UIC classification, it can reach a top speed of 120 km/h .

Therefore,In real conditions, the wheels are not entirely smooth and have imperfections. Despite\ntheir small size, these out-of-roundness irregularities can cause extreme variations in the wheelrail contact forces, producing vibrations on the train and track components. A periodic radial\ntread irregularity around the wheel circumference characterizes the wheel polygonization.\nAccording to Peng , for wheel polygonization, the irregularity amplitudes should be higher than 0. mm. Inherent to polygonization, some parameters can geometrically characterize the phenomenon, such as the varying wavelengths (λ) in the function of the harmonic order (θ)Two groups of polygonal wheel profiles are generated for the numerical simulations,\none for undamaged scenarios and another for damaged scenarios, based on real wheel measurements, the irregularity amplitude spectra of which are presented in Figure 6.**Figure 6.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) ( **a** ) initial polygonalFor the first group of profiles, the measurement data obtained by Johansson et al.\nfor new wheels with wavelengths comprising 20 harmonics were used .

A graphical representation of the numerical model is shown in Figure 9. Note that the first wheel of the first wagon on the right side isA series of accelerometers are mounted along the track to detect a polygonized wheel.\nAccording to the results demonstrated in Mosleh et al. , the location of the most promising sensors for obtaining good results is on the rail. However, the possibility of placing the sensors on the sleepers was also analyzed, since their installation is much easier. Using a virtual wayside monitoring system, acceleration measurements were\nevaluated from 16 positions, as shown in Figure 10.

As mentioned in Section 2.1, the ARX and CWT\nmodels are implemented and their performances as feature extractors are compared.\nTo establish a suitable ARX model order, AIC values are ascendingly ranked from\n1 to 70. An average AIC function is presented in Figure 12 based on 113 baseline analyses.\nIt is evident from this figure that after model order 40, the AIC values tend to stabilize,\nshowing that higher orders do not provide additional information. Therefore, the ARX models’ input and output orders are set to 40, and a total of 80 features are extracted. The\nsensor installed at position 5 ( yj in Equation (1)) is used as output, while each of the otherof the features extracted by the ARX models is higher than the CWT method.

In Figure 13b,c, a comparison of baseline and damaged scenarios shows similar variations in amplitude. In Figure 13d, the amplitude variation between healthy\nand damaged scenarios is evident, as the amplitude does not change much for the first\n143 passages, and then increases, which may indicate a wheel defect. Overall, the presenceregardless of the technique applied. Thus, the feature normalization step is implemented**Figure 13.** Feature extraction for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–feature 3, ( **b** ) ARX–feature 36, ( **c** ) CWT–featureout to obtain indicators that are more sensitive to damage and less sensitive to EOVs. The Latent Variable Method PCA is applied for data normalization. As explained in Section 5.1,\nfor all 173 train passages, 3-dimensional CWT-double-PCA-based feature matrices of\n173 × 468 are calculated for each sensor. At the same time, the ARX model is implementedsensor. Note that the PCA matrices have the same dimensions as the feature extraction step In Figure 14, the same four features shown in Figure 13 for sensor 1 are shown after\nimplementing PCA for all undamaged and damaged scenarios. During the modeling process, components with a cumulative percentage of variances higher than 80% are discarded. Therefore, the number of discarded rows is seventeen and two for CWT-doublePCA-based and ARX-PCA-based methods, respectively. The results obtained are quite\ndifferent depending on the method applied as a feature extractor. A reduction in theobserved in Figure 14a,b. However, CWT-double-PCA-based parameters in Figure 14c,d,\nshow a more effective normalization of the baseline features. Overall, both methods reduce**Figure 14.** Feature normalization for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based feature 3, ( **b** ) ARX–PCA–based\nfeature 36, ( **c** ) CWT–double–PCA-based feature 140, ( **d** ) CWT–double–PCA–based feature 266.To merge all the data obtained from the ARX and CWT methods, the Mahalanobis distance is implemented by applying a two-stage fusion process: in the first step, the\nfeatures from each sensor are merged and, in the second stage, the multi-sensor information is fused to enhance the sensibility to the damage. Therefore, in the first stage, Mahalanobis\ndistance transfers 468 CWT-double-PCA-based parameters into one column (173 × 1) for each sensor and train passage. At the same time, 80 ARX-PCA-based parameters are\nconverted to a single damage-sensitive feature (173 × 1). Figure 15 demonstrates theARX-PCA and CWT-double-PCA considering sensor 1. It is possible to observe that this process significantly improves damage detection sensitivity for both approaches.**Figure 15.** Features fusion for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based, ( **b** ) CWT–double–PCA–based.Afterwards, in the second stage, all sensor information is merged to improve the sensitivity to the damage even more.

Further, in the study by Peng , the mechanisms of\nOOR formation on wheels were presented considering different wear prediction models.\nConsidering recent technological advances, it is now possible to develop and implement automatic methodologies for detecting and identifying damage in different systems [15–17] for railway applications. With the application of these intelligent techniques, it\nis not intended to completely replace the visual inspections already used for many decades,\nbut rather, the creation of a compatible procedure. Traditional visual inspection and control techniques are expensive, occur at intervals, and are prone to errors, it is important to\nmotivate the widespread use of Structural Integrity Monitoring (SIE) systems, especially in\nrecent infrastructures or in systems of high value to society, as in the case of railway systems . Thus, it is essential to develop automatic methodologies for detecting different Despite the widespread research on railway defect detection, to the knowledge of the authors, the reported literature on automatic wheel polygonization identification has been limited so far. Therefore, taking advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies, it isan early stage. The detection of polygonized wheels is largely carried out using accelerometers mounted on the vehicle. The parametric power spectral estimation and adaptive chirpresults, but with flaws in polygonization detection in the early stages [19–21].\nOn the other hand, previous studies have shown very good results using waysidelearning in detecting defects in railway vehicle wheels, namely wheel flat detections .\nThis type of methodology usually presents the following steps: (i) feature extractionusing data from accelerations or strains measured on the track, (ii) feature modelingand operational variations, (iii) data fusion to merge different features and/or sensors information, and (iv) features discrimination to classify the defects. The studies carriedidentifying singular irregularities on the wheel surface (i.e., wheel flat). In this context, itcomprehensive number of damages, namely the ones that may occur along the entire Several methods have been used for feature extraction, which converts time-series\ndata into more condensed information, allowing damage to be more easily observed.\nSymbolic data, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) [15–17], principal component analysis\n(PCA) , and autoregressive models [15–17] are examples of effective techniques for\nextracting damage-sensitive features for both static and dynamic monitoring. In timedomain applications where the measured quantity is acceleration, autoregressive modelson the system response, with the model parameters reflecting the properties of the system regardless of the sources of excitations. CWT and PCA have been developed over decades in different applications, in both time and frequency domains with various sensors. Despite this, they present some limitations, PCA does not consider the non-linearity of the data\nand CWT adds excess redundancy to the data, and it has a high computational cost, so For feature fusion, several algorithms, including neighborhood-preserving embedding\n(NPE) , neural networks , Mahalanobis distance , manifold learning methods , and kernel-based methods , have been recently employed.

Due to its simplicity and ability to reduce multivariate data, Mahalanobis\nRecent approaches based on machine learning have been applied for feature classification to differentiate a healthy wheel from a defective one . Typically, two different approaches are used: (i) unsupervised methods, in which models are trained using labeled data under the supervision of training data, such as k-means , self-organizing maps\n(SOM) , and cluster analysis; or (ii) supervised methods, in which models are not supervised using training datasets, such as Naive Bayes classifiers and k-Nearest Neighbor\nThis work aims: (i) to develop an unsupervised methodology to identify polygonized\nwheels; (ii) to evaluate the performance of different feature extraction techniques concerning their sensitivity to the detection of wheel polygonization, specifically those based on\nautoregressive exogenous models (ARX) and continuous wavelet transforms (CWT); (iii) towheel defect detection system. The unsupervised methodology to identify polygonized wheels consists of five phases: (i) data acquisition, (ii) feature extraction, (iii) feature The acquired track responses are influenced by parameters such as speed, irregularities, and load types. In this sense, different simulations of realistic scenarios of dynamicconditions. On the other hand, to overcome some unpredictable oscillations in the measured responses and consequent failures in damage detection, some options can be taken.\nIn more complex structures, such as bridges and viaducts, there should be a greater susceptibility to damage when compared to areas of track sections on the foundation ground. If the structures are damaged, they may camouflage or cause false warnings. In a practical context, the use of sensors in an area of the track less prone to damage and where vibrationmethodology.

The outcome of this stepDI identifies a healthy or a defective wheel; a statistical confidence boundary (CB) isIn this study, the features are extracted based on autoregressive models with exogenous inputs (ARX) and continuous wavelet transform (CWT) models.

Moreover, ai, bk, ma, and mb are the parameters and the orders of the output and Initially, it is difficult to determine the most appropriate ARX model order. The key issue is that higher-order models could better match the data, but they may not generalize\nto other datasets. Otherwise, a low-order model is unlikely to capture the underlying physical system response. Several authors have noted the difficulty of defining a unique order for ARX models. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is reported to be one of the most effective optimization techniques . Based on the exchange between fit accuracy and the number of estimated parameters, AIC measures the goodness-of-fit of an estimatedparameters, respectively, and ε is the average sum-of-square residual ( SSR ) errors. To find out an optimum order, one should examine a wide range of orders and choose the orderStudies conducted by Li et al. showed good results in gearbox fault detection.\nCWT produces a two-dimensional set of coefficients from the analyzed signal. Although the Fourier transforms typically use sine waves as the basis for decomposition, other functionscan be selected for the wavelet shape due to signal properties. Two parameters define wavelet analysis: scale and translation. The CWT ( T ) of the signal x ( t ) is determined aswhere a and b are the scale and translation parameters, and ψ [∗] is the complex conjugate of the mother wavelet T that involves a continuous function in both time and frequency domains.\nAfter the implementation of a CWT on the evaluated signals, a PCA is performed\nfollowed by the extraction of four statistical parameters, resulting in significant data compression . Based on the p -by- q matrix X containing the extracted CWT features from the original signal evaluated by each sensor, where p is the measurement points number and q is the wavelets coefficients number, the principal components can be determinedwhere Ss represents the scores matrix, and T is a q -by- q orthonormal linear transformation matrix. In addition, four statistical parameters are extracted from the scores, Ss, including the root mean square (RMS), standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. Thus, a matrix p -by- q is transformed into a k -by- q matrix, where k equals 4. Consequently, a total of k × qenvironmental and operational variations (EOVs). For example, in damage detection, itare mostly sensitive to damage . Therefore, implementing a latent variable method,\nnamely the PCA, may efficiently reduce EOVs influences, without requiring the direct measurement of those effects. According to Bro and Smilde , PCA is a powerful and versatile method capable of providing an overview of complex multivariate data. PCA can be used to find and quantify patterns, generate new hypotheses, detect outliers, or find\nBy considering a m -by- f matrix X, taking into account features extracted from the dynamic responses, where m represents the train passages and f represents the number of\nfeatures extracted from sensors (i.e., k × q ), a transformation to another set of f features, Ss,\nis obtained by considering Equation (4). Considering the baseline condition, the covariance matrix ( C ) of the features is related to the covariance matrix of the scores Λ, as follows:where, Λ and T are matrices calculated by the singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix C . The columns of T are the eigenvectors and the diagonal matrix Λ, including\nthe eigenvalues of the matrix C in descending order. Thus, the eigenvalues stored in Λ areIt is possible to divide matrix Λ into two matrices with the first n eigenvalues and the remaining f-n eigenvalues. Determining the number of n -components is one of the\nchallenges in multivariate data interpretation. In this research study, n -components are\ndiscarded when the cumulative percentage of variance reaches 80% . Once n\nhas been selected, Equation (4) can be used to calculate the f-n components of matrix S. The transformation matrix T [ˆ] is constructed by the remaining f-n columns of matrix T . Using\nthe following function, the f-n components can be remapped to the main space:where, FPCA is m -by- f matrix of PCA features which is less sensitive to EOVs. Every sensorindex definition, is easy to implement and fast to process . For each simulation, the MD is considered to calculate a damage index (DI). Several damage identification studies haveDI . The MD is a well-known distance metric because it measures the distance\nbetween two points in a feature space containing two or more variables . Furthermore,\nit considers correlations between variables and does not depend on the scale of the features.\nIt can merge features from multiple sensors by performing data fusion. Mahalanobis\ndistance (namely here as DI ) is calculated by the following function:in which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−] , and is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The covariance matrix and mean vector intend to incorporate the baseline simulation. Based on the data derived from the\ndamaged system, a new observation would be far from the average of normal conditions.\nMahalanobis distances are calculated for each sensor and simulation. A matrix containing m Mahalanobis distances for i sensors is obtained from the above calculations.To automatically monitor train wheel conditions, the methodology performs outlier analysis.

A Gaussian distribution can be used to approximate the Mahalanobis distance, and statistical thresholds can be used to analyze outliers. By considering a mean value and standard deviation σ of the baseline feature vector, as well as the significance level α, itconsequently, when DI is equal to or higher than CB, a feature is considered to be an outlier.In the present research, the Laagrss freight train composed of five wagons is studied.\nAccording to the UIC classification, it can reach a top speed of 120 km/h .

Table 2 presents the properties of the track model.ties are very small, their effects on wheel-rail contact cannot be neglected . Therefore,In real conditions, the wheels are not entirely smooth and have imperfections. Despite\ntheir small size, these out-of-roundness irregularities can cause extreme variations in the wheelrail contact forces, producing vibrations on the train and track components. A periodic radial\ntread irregularity around the wheel circumference characterizes the wheel polygonization.\nAccording to Peng , for wheel polygonization, the irregularity amplitudes should be higher than 0. mm. Inherent to polygonization, some parameters can geometrically characterize the phenomenon, such as the varying wavelengths (λ) in the function of the harmonic order (θ)Two groups of polygonal wheel profiles are generated for the numerical simulations,\none for undamaged scenarios and another for damaged scenarios, based on real wheel measurements, the irregularity amplitude spectra of which are presented in Figure 6.**Figure 6.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) ( **a** ) initial polygonalFor the first group of profiles, the measurement data obtained by Johansson et al.\nfor new wheels with wavelengths comprising 20 harmonics were used .

The wheel irregularity level ( Lw ) values are selected based on the\nirregularity spectrums of Figure 6, for both cases: initial polygonization or polygonal damage . Considering phase angles ( ψθ ) to the sine functions that are uniformly and randomly distributed between 0 and 2π, several wheel irregularities are In the case of polygonal damage, simulating different amplitudes are applied atobtain two different damage severities in the function of amplitude ranges, one between\n0. mm and 0. mm (a1) and the other between 0. mm and 1. mm (a2).

A graphical representation of the numerical model is shown in Figure 9. Note that the first wheel of the first wagon on the right side isA series of accelerometers are mounted along the track to detect a polygonized wheel.\nAccording to the results demonstrated in Mosleh et al. , the location of the most promising sensors for obtaining good results is on the rail. However, the possibility of placing the sensors on the sleepers was also analyzed, since their installation is much easier. Using a virtual wayside monitoring system, acceleration measurements were\nevaluated from 16 positions, as shown in Figure 10.

Once validated,Based on several speeds, loading schemes, and unevenness profiles of the rail, Table 3\nsummarizes the simulations of the undamaged and damaged scenarios. Baseline scenariosconsider vehicle speeds between 40 and 120 km/h, and four unevenness profiles are considered for rail irregularities . A total of six types of loading schemes are\nconsidered: (i) a fully loaded train, (ii) a half-loaded train, (iii) an empty train, and trains with an unbalanced load in the transversal and longitudinal directions, namely (iv) UNB1,\n(v) UNB2, and (vi) UNB3. In accordance with UIC loading guidelines , differentgravity is longitudinally and transversally offset. For baseline scenarios, 113 simulationswheels with initial polygonal profiles. Therefore, in addition to 113 analyses with healthy wheels, 30 scenarios are considered with three semi-imperfection cases, including: (i) the right wheel on the front wheelset of the first wagon, (ii) the left wheel of the rear wheelset of the third wagon; (iii) the right wheel of the rear wheelset of the fifth wagon.

This figure illustrates the similarity between the measured accelerations\nin each case due to the similar amplitude of healthy and semi-imperfection wheels.\nAcceleration time series at position 1 for damaged wheels are presented in Figure 11b,\nconsidering two different amplitudes of wheel irregularity profiles. By comparing the results from Figure 11a,b, it is evident that the acceleration variation for the healthy wheel\nis between − 1. to 2. m/s , while the defective one changes between − 70 to 100 m/s .**Figure 11.** Acceleration time-series on position 1 for ( **a** ) healthy wheel and wheel with semiimperfection profile, ( **b** ) damaged wheel.As the first step in the automatic damage detection method, damage-sensitive features are extracted from dynamic responses. As mentioned in Section 2.1, the ARX and CWT\nmodels are implemented and their performances as feature extractors are compared.\nTo establish a suitable ARX model order, AIC values are ascendingly ranked from\n1 to 70. An average AIC function is presented in Figure 12 based on 113 baseline analyses.\nIt is evident from this figure that after model order 40, the AIC values tend to stabilize,\nshowing that higher orders do not provide additional information. Therefore, the ARX models’ input and output orders are set to 40, and a total of 80 features are extracted. The\nsensor installed at position 5 ( yj in Equation (1)) is used as output, while each of the otherof the features extracted by the ARX models is higher than the CWT method.

In Figure 13b,c, a comparison of baseline and damaged scenarios shows similar variations in amplitude. In Figure 13d, the amplitude variation between healthy\nand damaged scenarios is evident, as the amplitude does not change much for the first\n143 passages, and then increases, which may indicate a wheel defect. Overall, the presenceregardless of the technique applied. Thus, the feature normalization step is implemented**Figure 13.** Feature extraction for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–feature 3, ( **b** ) ARX–feature 36, ( **c** ) CWT–featureout to obtain indicators that are more sensitive to damage and less sensitive to EOVs. The Latent Variable Method PCA is applied for data normalization. As explained in Section 5.1,\nfor all 173 train passages, 3-dimensional CWT-double-PCA-based feature matrices of\n173 × 468 are calculated for each sensor. At the same time, the ARX model is implementedsensor. Note that the PCA matrices have the same dimensions as the feature extraction step In Figure 14, the same four features shown in Figure 13 for sensor 1 are shown after\nimplementing PCA for all undamaged and damaged scenarios. During the modeling process, components with a cumulative percentage of variances higher than 80% are discarded. Therefore, the number of discarded rows is seventeen and two for CWT-doublePCA-based and ARX-PCA-based methods, respectively. The results obtained are quite\ndifferent depending on the method applied as a feature extractor. A reduction in theobserved in Figure 14a,b. However, CWT-double-PCA-based parameters in Figure 14c,d,\nshow a more effective normalization of the baseline features.

Therefore, in the first stage, Mahalanobis\ndistance transfers 468 CWT-double-PCA-based parameters into one column (173 × 1) for each sensor and train passage. At the same time, 80 ARX-PCA-based parameters are\nconverted to a single damage-sensitive feature (173 × 1). Figure 15 demonstrates theARX-PCA and CWT-double-PCA considering sensor 1. It is possible to observe that this process significantly improves damage detection sensitivity for both approaches.**Figure 15.** Features fusion for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based, ( **b** ) CWT–double–PCA–based.Afterwards, in the second stage, all sensor information is merged to improve the sensitivity to the damage even more.

Therefore, it is possible to conclude that using ARX models as feature extractors**Figure 17.** Automatic wheel defect detection ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based ( **b** ) CWT–double–PCA–based.To reduce the time of installation and maintenance costs, it is necessary to obtain an\noptimal number of sensors, as well as a suitable location to install them without compromising the quality of the detection. As a result, a parametric study is carried out using\naccelerometers at distinct locations. In this analysis, only CWT is used for feature extraction because, as shown in Figure 17b, it is the best technique (with no false positives) compared(as presented in Figure 10) in terms of the total number (two, four, and six) are analyzed and the effectiveness of the detection methodology is demonstrated in Figure 18. The results concluded that even with two sensors (one on each side of the rail), the proposed**Figure 18.** Automatic polygonized wheel detection based on CWT technique considering: ( **a** ) sixIn the previous section, the proposed approach to detect a defective wheel from a healthy one was implemented for accelerometers located on the rail.

Thus, it is essential to develop automatic methodologies for detecting different Despite the widespread research on railway defect detection, to the knowledge of the authors, the reported literature on automatic wheel polygonization identification has been limited so far. Therefore, taking advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies, it isan early stage. The detection of polygonized wheels is largely carried out using accelerometers mounted on the vehicle.

Moreover, ai, bk, ma, and mb are the parameters and the orders of the output and Initially, it is difficult to determine the most appropriate ARX model order. The key issue is that higher-order models could better match the data, but they may not generalize\nto other datasets. Otherwise, a low-order model is unlikely to capture the underlying physical system response. Several authors have noted the difficulty of defining a unique order for ARX models. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is reported to be one of the most effective optimization techniques . Based on the exchange between fit accuracy and the number of estimated parameters, AIC measures the goodness-of-fit of an estimatedparameters, respectively, and ε is the average sum-of-square residual ( SSR ) errors. To find out an optimum order, one should examine a wide range of orders and choose the orderStudies conducted by Li et al. showed good results in gearbox fault detection.\nCWT produces a two-dimensional set of coefficients from the analyzed signal. Although the Fourier transforms typically use sine waves as the basis for decomposition, other functionscan be selected for the wavelet shape due to signal properties. Two parameters define wavelet analysis: scale and translation. The CWT ( T ) of the signal x ( t ) is determined aswhere a and b are the scale and translation parameters, and ψ [∗] is the complex conjugate of the mother wavelet T that involves a continuous function in both time and frequency domains.\nAfter the implementation of a CWT on the evaluated signals, a PCA is performed\nfollowed by the extraction of four statistical parameters, resulting in significant data compression . Based on the p -by- q matrix X containing the extracted CWT features from the original signal evaluated by each sensor, where p is the measurement points number and q is the wavelets coefficients number, the principal components can be determinedwhere Ss represents the scores matrix, and T is a q -by- q orthonormal linear transformation matrix. In addition, four statistical parameters are extracted from the scores, Ss, including the root mean square (RMS), standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. Thus, a matrix p -by- q is transformed into a k -by- q matrix, where k equals 4. Consequently, a total of k × qenvironmental and operational variations (EOVs). For example, in damage detection, itare mostly sensitive to damage . Therefore, implementing a latent variable method,\nnamely the PCA, may efficiently reduce EOVs influences, without requiring the direct measurement of those effects.

Once n\nhas been selected, Equation (4) can be used to calculate the f-n components of matrix S. The transformation matrix T [ˆ] is constructed by the remaining f-n columns of matrix T . Using\nthe following function, the f-n components can be remapped to the main space:where, FPCA is m -by- f matrix of PCA features which is less sensitive to EOVs. Every sensorindex definition, is easy to implement and fast to process . For each simulation, the MD is considered to calculate a damage index (DI). Several damage identification studies haveDI . The MD is a well-known distance metric because it measures the distance\nbetween two points in a feature space containing two or more variables . Furthermore,\nit considers correlations between variables and does not depend on the scale of the features.\nIt can merge features from multiple sensors by performing data fusion. Mahalanobis\ndistance (namely here as DI ) is calculated by the following function:in which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−] , and is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The covariance matrix and mean vector intend to incorporate the baseline simulation. Based on the data derived from the\ndamaged system, a new observation would be far from the average of normal conditions.\nMahalanobis distances are calculated for each sensor and simulation. A matrix containing m Mahalanobis distances for i sensors is obtained from the above calculations.To automatically monitor train wheel conditions, the methodology performs outlier analysis. In Meixedo et al. and Mosleh et al. , this tool proved to be very efficient in\nclassifying the data as being related to a scenario with or without damage. Mahalanobisspace. A Gaussian distribution can be used to approximate the Mahalanobis distance, and statistical thresholds can be used to analyze outliers. By considering a mean value and standard deviation σ of the baseline feature vector, as well as the significance level α, itconsequently, when DI is equal to or higher than CB, a feature is considered to be an outlier.In the present research, the Laagrss freight train composed of five wagons is studied.\nAccording to the UIC classification, it can reach a top speed of 120 km/h . Each wagon has a tare weight of 27 t and can carry loads up to 52 t. A double freight wagon is shown incomponent. A rigid beam element was also used to connect the above-mentioned components. The numerical model of the vehicle is presented in Figure 3 and the mechanicaland geometric properties of the vehicle are detailed in Table 1. More details regarding the\nnumerical model of the freight wagons are provided by Bragança et al. .program, developed by Montenegro et al. . The model is based on a multi-layer scheme,\nsimulating the ballast, sleepers, and rails, as shown in Figure 4. The railpads, resting on the sleepers under the rail, are simulated as spring elements connecting the sleepers and\nrail. The mass of the ballast is represented by elements of discrete mass points, while the\nrails and sleepers are modeled using beam elements, adopting the appropriate material properties for each one. Finally, spring-dashpot elements are also incorporated to consider\nfoundation flexibility. Table 2 presents the properties of the track model.ties are very small, their effects on wheel-rail contact cannot be neglected . Therefore,In real conditions, the wheels are not entirely smooth and have imperfections. Despite\ntheir small size, these out-of-roundness irregularities can cause extreme variations in the wheelrail contact forces, producing vibrations on the train and track components. A periodic radial\ntread irregularity around the wheel circumference characterizes the wheel polygonization.\nAccording to Peng , for wheel polygonization, the irregularity amplitudes should be higher than 0. mm. Inherent to polygonization, some parameters can geometrically characterize the phenomenon, such as the varying wavelengths (λ) in the function of the harmonic order (θ)Two groups of polygonal wheel profiles are generated for the numerical simulations,\none for undamaged scenarios and another for damaged scenarios, based on real wheel measurements, the irregularity amplitude spectra of which are presented in Figure 6.**Figure 6.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) ( **a** ) initial polygonalFor the first group of profiles, the measurement data obtained by Johansson et al.\nfor new wheels with wavelengths comprising 20 harmonics were used . Thebetween 0.135–2. m, being the upper limit of the perimeter of the wheel. For the second group of profiles, the measurement values for four wheels with polygonal damage obtained\nby Cai et al. were considered . The wheel pr i s are characterized by the\nwavelengths in the first 30 harmonics, with the 6th to 8th harmonic orders being dominant.\nThen, different irregularity wheel profiles are generated based on the sum of sine### w ( xw ) = ∑ Aθ sin [ψ] [θ]where Aθ is the amplitude of the sine function for each wavelength, which is calculated bywhere, as wre f = 1 µm. The wheel irregularity level ( Lw ) values are selected based on the\nirregularity spectrums of Figure 6, for both cases: initial polygonization or polygonal damage . Considering phase angles ( ψθ ) to the sine functions that are uniformly and randomly distributed between 0 and 2π, several wheel irregularities are In the case of polygonal damage, simulating different amplitudes are applied atobtain two different damage severities in the function of amplitude ranges, one between\n0. mm and 0. mm (a1) and the other between 0. mm and 1. mm (a2).

By observing these two figures, the difference inaround 0. mm and a damaged polygonal wheel with amplitudes between 0. mm and**Figure 7.** Example of an initial polygonization profile based on Figure 6a irregularity spectrum.**Figure 8.** Examples of polygonization-damaged profiles based on Figure 6b irregularity spectrumusing the in-house software VSI—Vehicle-Structure Interaction Analysis, which was validated and described in detail in the authors’ previous publication and was used in various of applications . In this model, the train is coupled to the track using a 3D wheel-rail contact model, using Hertzian theory to calculate the normal contact forces andsoftware. It is important to note that both subsystems are initially separately modeled in\nmodels via a fully coupled approach . The full explanation of the properties of\ntrack and train, including more details regarding train-track interaction, can be found in the authors’ previous publications . A graphical representation of the numerical model is shown in Figure 9. Note that the first wheel of the first wagon on the right side isA series of accelerometers are mounted along the track to detect a polygonized wheel.\nAccording to the results demonstrated in Mosleh et al. , the location of the most promising sensors for obtaining good results is on the rail. However, the possibility of placing the sensors on the sleepers was also analyzed, since their installation is much easier. Using a virtual wayside monitoring system, acceleration measurements were\nevaluated from 16 positions, as shown in Figure 10. In this figure, the numbers 1-to-4 andsleepers on the right and left sides, respectively, while the accelerations over the sleepers are measured by sensors located on positions 9-to-12 and 13-to-16. A virtual simulationautomatic wheel polygonized detection approach presented in this study. Once validated,Based on several speeds, loading schemes, and unevenness profiles of the rail, Table 3\nsummarizes the simulations of the undamaged and damaged scenarios. Baseline scenariosconsider vehicle speeds between 40 and 120 km/h, and four unevenness profiles are considered for rail irregularities . A total of six types of loading schemes are\nconsidered: (i) a fully loaded train, (ii) a half-loaded train, (iii) an empty train, and trains with an unbalanced load in the transversal and longitudinal directions, namely (iv) UNB1,\n(v) UNB2, and (vi) UNB3. In accordance with UIC loading guidelines , differentgravity is longitudinally and transversally offset. For baseline scenarios, 113 simulationswheels with initial polygonal profiles. Therefore, in addition to 113 analyses with healthy wheels, 30 scenarios are considered with three semi-imperfection cases, including: (i) the right wheel on the front wheelset of the first wagon, (ii) the left wheel of the rear wheelset of the third wagon; (iii) the right wheel of the rear wheelset of the fifth wagon. Furthermore,the front wheel on the right side of the first wagon as a polygonized wheel. These scenarioslow-pass Chebyshev type II digital filter. In addition, an artificial noise (5% of amplitude)response. An example of a comparison of measured responses regarding the passage of ashown in Figure 11a. The wheel with a semi-imperfection profile is located on the first wheel of the first wagon. This figure illustrates the similarity between the measured accelerations\nin each case due to the similar amplitude of healthy and semi-imperfection wheels.\nAcceleration time series at position 1 for damaged wheels are presented in Figure 11b,\nconsidering two different amplitudes of wheel irregularity profiles. By comparing the results from Figure 11a,b, it is evident that the acceleration variation for the healthy wheel\nis between − 1. to 2. m/s , while the defective one changes between − 70 to 100 m/s .**Figure 11.** Acceleration time-series on position 1 for ( **a** ) healthy wheel and wheel with semiimperfection profile, ( **b** ) damaged wheel.As the first step in the automatic damage detection method, damage-sensitive features are extracted from dynamic responses. As mentioned in Section 2.1, the ARX and CWT\nmodels are implemented and their performances as feature extractors are compared.\nTo establish a suitable ARX model order, AIC values are ascendingly ranked from\n1 to 70. An average AIC function is presented in Figure 12 based on 113 baseline analyses.\nIt is evident from this figure that after model order 40, the AIC values tend to stabilize,\nshowing that higher orders do not provide additional information. Therefore, the ARX models’ input and output orders are set to 40, and a total of 80 features are extracted. The\nsensor installed at position 5 ( yj in Equation (1)) is used as output, while each of the otherof the features extracted by the ARX models is higher than the CWT method.

In Figure 13b,c, a comparison of baseline and damaged scenarios shows similar variations in amplitude. In Figure 13d, the amplitude variation between healthy\nand damaged scenarios is evident, as the amplitude does not change much for the first\n143 passages, and then increases, which may indicate a wheel defect. Overall, the presenceregardless of the technique applied. Thus, the feature normalization step is implemented**Figure 13.** Feature extraction for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–feature 3, ( **b** ) ARX–feature 36, ( **c** ) CWT–featureout to obtain indicators that are more sensitive to damage and less sensitive to EOVs. The Latent Variable Method PCA is applied for data normalization. As explained in Section 5.1,\nfor all 173 train passages, 3-dimensional CWT-double-PCA-based feature matrices of\n173 × 468 are calculated for each sensor. At the same time, the ARX model is implementedsensor. Note that the PCA matrices have the same dimensions as the feature extraction step In Figure 14, the same four features shown in Figure 13 for sensor 1 are shown after\nimplementing PCA for all undamaged and damaged scenarios. During the modeling process, components with a cumulative percentage of variances higher than 80% are discarded. Therefore, the number of discarded rows is seventeen and two for CWT-doublePCA-based and ARX-PCA-based methods, respectively. The results obtained are quite\ndifferent depending on the method applied as a feature extractor. A reduction in theobserved in Figure 14a,b. However, CWT-double-PCA-based parameters in Figure 14c,d,\nshow a more effective normalization of the baseline features. Overall, both methods reduce**Figure 14.** Feature normalization for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based feature 3, ( **b** ) ARX–PCA–based\nfeature 36, ( **c** ) CWT–double–PCA-based feature 140, ( **d** ) CWT–double–PCA–based feature 266.To merge all the data obtained from the ARX and CWT methods, the Mahalanobis distance is implemented by applying a two-stage fusion process: in the first step, the\nfeatures from each sensor are merged and, in the second stage, the multi-sensor information is fused to enhance the sensibility to the damage. Therefore, in the first stage, Mahalanobis\ndistance transfers 468 CWT-double-PCA-based parameters into one column (173 × 1) for each sensor and train passage. At the same time, 80 ARX-PCA-based parameters are\nconverted to a single damage-sensitive feature (173 × 1). Figure 15 demonstrates theARX-PCA and CWT-double-PCA considering sensor 1. It is possible to observe that this process significantly improves damage detection sensitivity for both approaches.**Figure 15.** Features fusion for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based, ( **b** ) CWT–double–PCA–based.Afterwards, in the second stage, all sensor information is merged to improve the sensitivity to the damage even more.

It significantly increases the possibility of effective automatic**Figure 16.** Sensors fusion, ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based, ( **b** ) CWT–double–PCA–based.Despite the visual distinction between healthy and damaged wheels using data processing discussed above, strategies for unsupervised wayside monitoring should employhealthy states . Moreover, comparing the ARX and CWT methods is consideredthe most reliable results. The last step of the polygonized wheel detection technique is tofunction. The significance level of the threshold is defined as 1%, as it has been commonly(173 passages), Figure 17 illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed methodology for distinguishing undamaged from damaged scenarios.

Theypositives or negatives using the CWT technique for feature extraction . On the\nother hand, when the input signal is evaluated by the ARX method, two false positives are observed. Therefore, it is possible to conclude that using ARX models as feature extractors**Figure 17.** Automatic wheel defect detection ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based ( **b** ) CWT–double–PCA–based.To reduce the time of installation and maintenance costs, it is necessary to obtain an\noptimal number of sensors, as well as a suitable location to install them without compromising the quality of the detection. As a result, a parametric study is carried out using\naccelerometers at distinct locations. In this analysis, only CWT is used for feature extraction because, as shown in Figure 17b, it is the best technique (with no false positives) compared(as presented in Figure 10) in terms of the total number (two, four, and six) are analyzed and the effectiveness of the detection methodology is demonstrated in Figure 18. The results concluded that even with two sensors (one on each side of the rail), the proposed**Figure 18.** Automatic polygonized wheel detection based on CWT technique considering: ( **a** ) sixIn the previous section, the proposed approach to detect a defective wheel from a healthy one was implemented for accelerometers located on the rail.

By using the Mahalanobis distance, the features from each sensor can be effectively merged in the first stage. Moreover, a new Mahalanobis distance is applied\nagain in the second stage to integrate all sensor information. The outcome of this stepDI identifies a healthy or a defective wheel; a statistical confidence boundary (CB) isIn this study, the features are extracted based on autoregressive models with exogenous inputs (ARX) and continuous wavelet transform (CWT) models.

The ARX autoregressive model considers the predictive behavior of the system at a specific location, considering its history at the same\npoint and the predictive response at other measurement locations, being defined by the### xj = ∑ aixj−i +### ∑ bkyj−k + ε j (1)where xj, yj, and ε j are the output, input, as well as error term of the model at the signal value j . Moreover, ai, bk, ma, and mb are the parameters and the orders of the output and Initially, it is difficult to determine the most appropriate ARX model order. The key issue is that higher-order models could better match the data, but they may not generalize\nto other datasets. Otherwise, a low-order model is unlikely to capture the underlying physical system response. Several authors have noted the difficulty of defining a unique order for ARX models. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is reported to be one of the most effective optimization techniques . Based on the exchange between fit accuracy and the number of estimated parameters, AIC measures the goodness-of-fit of an estimatedparameters, respectively, and ε is the average sum-of-square residual ( SSR ) errors. To find out an optimum order, one should examine a wide range of orders and choose the orderStudies conducted by Li et al. showed good results in gearbox fault detection.\nCWT produces a two-dimensional set of coefficients from the analyzed signal. Although the Fourier transforms typically use sine waves as the basis for decomposition, other functionscan be selected for the wavelet shape due to signal properties. Two parameters define wavelet analysis: scale and translation. The CWT ( T ) of the signal x ( t ) is determined aswhere a and b are the scale and translation parameters, and ψ [∗] is the complex conjugate of the mother wavelet T that involves a continuous function in both time and frequency domains.\nAfter the implementation of a CWT on the evaluated signals, a PCA is performed\nfollowed by the extraction of four statistical parameters, resulting in significant data compression . Based on the p -by- q matrix X containing the extracted CWT features from the original signal evaluated by each sensor, where p is the measurement points number and q is the wavelets coefficients number, the principal components can be determinedwhere Ss represents the scores matrix, and T is a q -by- q orthonormal linear transformation matrix. In addition, four statistical parameters are extracted from the scores, Ss, including the root mean square (RMS), standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. Thus, a matrix p -by- q is transformed into a k -by- q matrix, where k equals 4. Consequently, a total of k × qenvironmental and operational variations (EOVs). For example, in damage detection, itare mostly sensitive to damage . Therefore, implementing a latent variable method,\nnamely the PCA, may efficiently reduce EOVs influences, without requiring the direct measurement of those effects. According to Bro and Smilde , PCA is a powerful and versatile method capable of providing an overview of complex multivariate data. PCA can be used to find and quantify patterns, generate new hypotheses, detect outliers, or find\nBy considering a m -by- f matrix X, taking into account features extracted from the dynamic responses, where m represents the train passages and f represents the number of\nfeatures extracted from sensors (i.e., k × q ), a transformation to another set of f features, Ss,\nis obtained by considering Equation (4). Considering the baseline condition, the covariance matrix ( C ) of the features is related to the covariance matrix of the scores Λ, as follows:where, Λ and T are matrices calculated by the singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix C . The columns of T are the eigenvectors and the diagonal matrix Λ, including\nthe eigenvalues of the matrix C in descending order. Thus, the eigenvalues stored in Λ areIt is possible to divide matrix Λ into two matrices with the first n eigenvalues and the remaining f-n eigenvalues. Determining the number of n -components is one of the\nchallenges in multivariate data interpretation. In this research study, n -components are\ndiscarded when the cumulative percentage of variance reaches 80% . Once n\nhas been selected, Equation (4) can be used to calculate the f-n components of matrix S. The transformation matrix T [ˆ] is constructed by the remaining f-n columns of matrix T . Using\nthe following function, the f-n components can be remapped to the main space:where, FPCA is m -by- f matrix of PCA features which is less sensitive to EOVs. Every sensorindex definition, is easy to implement and fast to process . For each simulation, the MD is considered to calculate a damage index (DI). Several damage identification studies haveDI . The MD is a well-known distance metric because it measures the distance\nbetween two points in a feature space containing two or more variables . Furthermore,\nit considers correlations between variables and does not depend on the scale of the features.\nIt can merge features from multiple sensors by performing data fusion. Mahalanobis\ndistance (namely here as DI ) is calculated by the following function:in which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−] , and is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The covariance matrix and mean vector intend to incorporate the baseline simulation. Based on the data derived from the\ndamaged system, a new observation would be far from the average of normal conditions.\nMahalanobis distances are calculated for each sensor and simulation. A matrix containing m Mahalanobis distances for i sensors is obtained from the above calculations.To automatically monitor train wheel conditions, the methodology performs outlier analysis. In Meixedo et al. and Mosleh et al. , this tool proved to be very efficient in\nclassifying the data as being related to a scenario with or without damage. Mahalanobisspace. A Gaussian distribution can be used to approximate the Mahalanobis distance, and statistical thresholds can be used to analyze outliers. By considering a mean value and standard deviation σ of the baseline feature vector, as well as the significance level α, itconsequently, when DI is equal to or higher than CB, a feature is considered to be an outlier.In the present research, the Laagrss freight train composed of five wagons is studied.\nAccording to the UIC classification, it can reach a top speed of 120 km/h . Each wagon has a tare weight of 27 t and can carry loads up to 52 t. A double freight wagon is shown incomponent. A rigid beam element was also used to connect the above-mentioned components.

The model is based on a multi-layer scheme,\nsimulating the ballast, sleepers, and rails, as shown in Figure 4. The railpads, resting on the sleepers under the rail, are simulated as spring elements connecting the sleepers and\nrail. The mass of the ballast is represented by elements of discrete mass points, while the\nrails and sleepers are modeled using beam elements, adopting the appropriate material properties for each one. Finally, spring-dashpot elements are also incorporated to consider\nfoundation flexibility. Table 2 presents the properties of the track model.ties are very small, their effects on wheel-rail contact cannot be neglected . Therefore,In real conditions, the wheels are not entirely smooth and have imperfections. Despite\ntheir small size, these out-of-roundness irregularities can cause extreme variations in the wheelrail contact forces, producing vibrations on the train and track components. A periodic radial\ntread irregularity around the wheel circumference characterizes the wheel polygonization.\nAccording to Peng , for wheel polygonization, the irregularity amplitudes should be higher than 0. mm. Inherent to polygonization, some parameters can geometrically characterize the phenomenon, such as the varying wavelengths (λ) in the function of the harmonic order (θ)Two groups of polygonal wheel profiles are generated for the numerical simulations,\none for undamaged scenarios and another for damaged scenarios, based on real wheel measurements, the irregularity amplitude spectra of which are presented in Figure 6.**Figure 6.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) ( **a** ) initial polygonalFor the first group of profiles, the measurement data obtained by Johansson et al.\nfor new wheels with wavelengths comprising 20 harmonics were used . Thebetween 0.135–2. m, being the upper limit of the perimeter of the wheel.

The wheel pr i s are characterized by the\nwavelengths in the first 30 harmonics, with the 6th to 8th harmonic orders being dominant.\nThen, different irregularity wheel profiles are generated based on the sum of sine### w ( xw ) = ∑ Aθ sin [ψ] [θ]where Aθ is the amplitude of the sine function for each wavelength, which is calculated bywhere, as wre f = 1 µm. The wheel irregularity level ( Lw ) values are selected based on the\nirregularity spectrums of Figure 6, for both cases: initial polygonization or polygonal damage . Considering phase angles ( ψθ ) to the sine functions that are uniformly and randomly distributed between 0 and 2π, several wheel irregularities are In the case of polygonal damage, simulating different amplitudes are applied atobtain two different damage severities in the function of amplitude ranges, one between\n0. mm and 0. mm (a1) and the other between 0. mm and 1. mm (a2).

A graphical representation of the numerical model is shown in Figure 9. Note that the first wheel of the first wagon on the right side isA series of accelerometers are mounted along the track to detect a polygonized wheel.\nAccording to the results demonstrated in Mosleh et al. , the location of the most promising sensors for obtaining good results is on the rail. However, the possibility of placing the sensors on the sleepers was also analyzed, since their installation is much easier. Using a virtual wayside monitoring system, acceleration measurements were\nevaluated from 16 positions, as shown in Figure 10.

Once validated,Based on several speeds, loading schemes, and unevenness profiles of the rail, Table 3\nsummarizes the simulations of the undamaged and damaged scenarios. Baseline scenariosconsider vehicle speeds between 40 and 120 km/h, and four unevenness profiles are considered for rail irregularities . A total of six types of loading schemes are\nconsidered: (i) a fully loaded train, (ii) a half-loaded train, (iii) an empty train, and trains with an unbalanced load in the transversal and longitudinal directions, namely (iv) UNB1,\n(v) UNB2, and (vi) UNB3. In accordance with UIC loading guidelines , differentgravity is longitudinally and transversally offset. For baseline scenarios, 113 simulationswheels with initial polygonal profiles. Therefore, in addition to 113 analyses with healthy wheels, 30 scenarios are considered with three semi-imperfection cases, including: (i) the right wheel on the front wheelset of the first wagon, (ii) the left wheel of the rear wheelset of the third wagon; (iii) the right wheel of the rear wheelset of the fifth wagon.

By comparing the results from Figure 11a,b, it is evident that the acceleration variation for the healthy wheel\nis between − 1. to 2. m/s , while the defective one changes between − 70 to 100 m/s .**Figure 11.** Acceleration time-series on position 1 for ( **a** ) healthy wheel and wheel with semiimperfection profile, ( **b** ) damaged wheel.As the first step in the automatic damage detection method, damage-sensitive features are extracted from dynamic responses. As mentioned in Section 2.1, the ARX and CWT\nmodels are implemented and their performances as feature extractors are compared.\nTo establish a suitable ARX model order, AIC values are ascendingly ranked from\n1 to 70. An average AIC function is presented in Figure 12 based on 113 baseline analyses.\nIt is evident from this figure that after model order 40, the AIC values tend to stabilize,\nshowing that higher orders do not provide additional information. Therefore, the ARX models’ input and output orders are set to 40, and a total of 80 features are extracted. The\nsensor installed at position 5 ( yj in Equation (1)) is used as output, while each of the otherof the features extracted by the ARX models is higher than the CWT method.

Overall, the presenceregardless of the technique applied. Thus, the feature normalization step is implemented**Figure 13.** Feature extraction for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–feature 3, ( **b** ) ARX–feature 36, ( **c** ) CWT–featureout to obtain indicators that are more sensitive to damage and less sensitive to EOVs. The Latent Variable Method PCA is applied for data normalization.

Note that the PCA matrices have the same dimensions as the feature extraction step In Figure 14, the same four features shown in Figure 13 for sensor 1 are shown after\nimplementing PCA for all undamaged and damaged scenarios. During the modeling process, components with a cumulative percentage of variances higher than 80% are discarded. Therefore, the number of discarded rows is seventeen and two for CWT-doublePCA-based and ARX-PCA-based methods, respectively. The results obtained are quite\ndifferent depending on the method applied as a feature extractor. A reduction in theobserved in Figure 14a,b.

Therefore, in the first stage, Mahalanobis\ndistance transfers 468 CWT-double-PCA-based parameters into one column (173 × 1) for each sensor and train passage. At the same time, 80 ARX-PCA-based parameters are\nconverted to a single damage-sensitive feature (173 × 1). Figure 15 demonstrates theARX-PCA and CWT-double-PCA considering sensor 1. It is possible to observe that this process significantly improves damage detection sensitivity for both approaches.**Figure 15.** Features fusion for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based, ( **b** ) CWT–double–PCA–based.Afterwards, in the second stage, all sensor information is merged to improve the sensitivity to the damage even more.

As a result, a parametric study is carried out using\naccelerometers at distinct locations. In this analysis, only CWT is used for feature extraction because, as shown in Figure 17b, it is the best technique (with no false positives) compared(as presented in Figure 10) in terms of the total number (two, four, and six) are analyzed and the effectiveness of the detection methodology is demonstrated in Figure 18.

With the application of these intelligent techniques, it\nis not intended to completely replace the visual inspections already used for many decades,\nbut rather, the creation of a compatible procedure. Traditional visual inspection and control techniques are expensive, occur at intervals, and are prone to errors, it is important to\nmotivate the widespread use of Structural Integrity Monitoring (SIE) systems, especially in\nrecent infrastructures or in systems of high value to society, as in the case of railway systems . Thus, it is essential to develop automatic methodologies for detecting different Despite the widespread research on railway defect detection, to the knowledge of the authors, the reported literature on automatic wheel polygonization identification has been limited so far. Therefore, taking advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies, it isan early stage. The detection of polygonized wheels is largely carried out using accelerometers mounted on the vehicle. The parametric power spectral estimation and adaptive chirpresults, but with flaws in polygonization detection in the early stages [19–21].\nOn the other hand, previous studies have shown very good results using waysidelearning in detecting defects in railway vehicle wheels, namely wheel flat detections .\nThis type of methodology usually presents the following steps: (i) feature extractionusing data from accelerations or strains measured on the track, (ii) feature modelingand operational variations, (iii) data fusion to merge different features and/or sensors information, and (iv) features discrimination to classify the defects. The studies carriedidentifying singular irregularities on the wheel surface (i.e., wheel flat). In this context, itcomprehensive number of damages, namely the ones that may occur along the entire Several methods have been used for feature extraction, which converts time-series\ndata into more condensed information, allowing damage to be more easily observed.\nSymbolic data, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) [15–17], principal component analysis\n(PCA) , and autoregressive models [15–17] are examples of effective techniques for\nextracting damage-sensitive features for both static and dynamic monitoring. In timedomain applications where the measured quantity is acceleration, autoregressive modelson the system response, with the model parameters reflecting the properties of the system regardless of the sources of excitations. CWT and PCA have been developed over decades in different applications, in both time and frequency domains with various sensors. Despite this, they present some limitations, PCA does not consider the non-linearity of the data\nand CWT adds excess redundancy to the data, and it has a high computational cost, so For feature fusion, several algorithms, including neighborhood-preserving embedding\n(NPE) , neural networks , Mahalanobis distance , manifold learning methods , and kernel-based methods , have been recently employed. This data fusioninformation. Due to its simplicity and ability to reduce multivariate data, Mahalanobis\nRecent approaches based on machine learning have been applied for feature classification to differentiate a healthy wheel from a defective one . Typically, two different approaches are used: (i) unsupervised methods, in which models are trained using labeled data under the supervision of training data, such as k-means , self-organizing maps\n(SOM) , and cluster analysis; or (ii) supervised methods, in which models are not supervised using training datasets, such as Naive Bayes classifiers and k-Nearest Neighbor\nThis work aims: (i) to develop an unsupervised methodology to identify polygonized\nwheels; (ii) to evaluate the performance of different feature extraction techniques concerning their sensitivity to the detection of wheel polygonization, specifically those based on\nautoregressive exogenous models (ARX) and continuous wavelet transforms (CWT); (iii) towheel defect detection system. The unsupervised methodology to identify polygonized wheels consists of five phases: (i) data acquisition, (ii) feature extraction, (iii) feature The acquired track responses are influenced by parameters such as speed, irregularities, and load types. In this sense, different simulations of realistic scenarios of dynamicconditions. On the other hand, to overcome some unpredictable oscillations in the measured responses and consequent failures in damage detection, some options can be taken.\nIn more complex structures, such as bridges and viaducts, there should be a greater susceptibility to damage when compared to areas of track sections on the foundation ground. If the structures are damaged, they may camouflage or cause false warnings. In a practical context, the use of sensors in an area of the track less prone to damage and where vibrationmethodology. Aligned on these assumptions, the location of the sensors was chosen on aAfter defining the AI approach for identifying wheel polygonization, two distinguished feature extraction methods, namely ARX and CWT, are compared. To avoid\nfalse alarm situations caused by environmental and operational effects, the latent variable method Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied. To reduce the volume of extracted data while retaining the most relevant information, as well as improve the ability to characterize the measured phenomenon, the data are merged using the Mahalanobis distance. As\na final step, an outlier analysis is employed to automatically distinguish a healthy wheel It should be highlighted that wheel flat identification was developed by Mosleh et al. ,\nwho demonstrated that the methodology is able to identify wheel flats. The validation of the proposed AI-based methodology herein, considering a polygonal wheel, is a clear step forward\nin terms of the proposed methodology’s effectiveness, allowing for a complete implementation**2. Proposed Methodology for Automatic Wheel Polygonization Detection**(ii) Feature extraction from multiple sensor signals, by continuous wavelet transforms\n(CWT) or autoregressive exogenous (ARX) models, that are separately implemented,\nand their performances are compared; in this step, a time record is transformed intonot only normalizes the extracted features but also increases their sensitivity to damage.sensitivity. By using the Mahalanobis distance, the features from each sensor can be effectively merged in the first stage. Moreover, a new Mahalanobis distance is applied\nagain in the second stage to integrate all sensor information. The outcome of this stepDI identifies a healthy or a defective wheel; a statistical confidence boundary (CB) isIn this study, the features are extracted based on autoregressive models with exogenous inputs (ARX) and continuous wavelet transform (CWT) models. The performance ofthe occurrence of gearbox failures. The ARX autoregressive model considers the predictive behavior of the system at a specific location, considering its history at the same\npoint and the predictive response at other measurement locations, being defined by the### xj = ∑ aixj−i +### ∑ bkyj−k + ε j (1)where xj, yj, and ε j are the output, input, as well as error term of the model at the signal value j . Moreover, ai, bk, ma, and mb are the parameters and the orders of the output and Initially, it is difficult to determine the most appropriate ARX model order. The key issue is that higher-order models could better match the data, but they may not generalize\nto other datasets. Otherwise, a low-order model is unlikely to capture the underlying physical system response. Several authors have noted the difficulty of defining a unique order for ARX models. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is reported to be one of the most effective optimization techniques . Based on the exchange between fit accuracy and the number of estimated parameters, AIC measures the goodness-of-fit of an estimatedparameters, respectively, and ε is the average sum-of-square residual ( SSR ) errors. To find out an optimum order, one should examine a wide range of orders and choose the orderStudies conducted by Li et al. showed good results in gearbox fault detection.\nCWT produces a two-dimensional set of coefficients from the analyzed signal. Although the Fourier transforms typically use sine waves as the basis for decomposition, other functionscan be selected for the wavelet shape due to signal properties. Two parameters define wavelet analysis: scale and translation. The CWT ( T ) of the signal x ( t ) is determined aswhere a and b are the scale and translation parameters, and ψ [∗] is the complex conjugate of the mother wavelet T that involves a continuous function in both time and frequency domains.\nAfter the implementation of a CWT on the evaluated signals, a PCA is performed\nfollowed by the extraction of four statistical parameters, resulting in significant data compression . Based on the p -by- q matrix X containing the extracted CWT features from the original signal evaluated by each sensor, where p is the measurement points number and q is the wavelets coefficients number, the principal components can be determinedwhere Ss represents the scores matrix, and T is a q -by- q orthonormal linear transformation matrix. In addition, four statistical parameters are extracted from the scores, Ss, including the root mean square (RMS), standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. Thus, a matrix p -by- q is transformed into a k -by- q matrix, where k equals 4. Consequently, a total of k × qenvironmental and operational variations (EOVs). For example, in damage detection, itare mostly sensitive to damage . Therefore, implementing a latent variable method,\nnamely the PCA, may efficiently reduce EOVs influences, without requiring the direct measurement of those effects. According to Bro and Smilde , PCA is a powerful and versatile method capable of providing an overview of complex multivariate data. PCA can be used to find and quantify patterns, generate new hypotheses, detect outliers, or find\nBy considering a m -by- f matrix X, taking into account features extracted from the dynamic responses, where m represents the train passages and f represents the number of\nfeatures extracted from sensors (i.e., k × q ), a transformation to another set of f features, Ss,\nis obtained by considering Equation (4). Considering the baseline condition, the covariance matrix ( C ) of the features is related to the covariance matrix of the scores Λ, as follows:where, Λ and T are matrices calculated by the singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix C . The columns of T are the eigenvectors and the diagonal matrix Λ, including\nthe eigenvalues of the matrix C in descending order. Thus, the eigenvalues stored in Λ areIt is possible to divide matrix Λ into two matrices with the first n eigenvalues and the remaining f-n eigenvalues. Determining the number of n -components is one of the\nchallenges in multivariate data interpretation. In this research study, n -components are\ndiscarded when the cumulative percentage of variance reaches 80% . Once n\nhas been selected, Equation (4) can be used to calculate the f-n components of matrix S. The transformation matrix T [ˆ] is constructed by the remaining f-n columns of matrix T . Using\nthe following function, the f-n components can be remapped to the main space:where, FPCA is m -by- f matrix of PCA features which is less sensitive to EOVs. Every sensorindex definition, is easy to implement and fast to process . For each simulation, the MD is considered to calculate a damage index (DI). Several damage identification studies haveDI . The MD is a well-known distance metric because it measures the distance\nbetween two points in a feature space containing two or more variables . Furthermore,\nit considers correlations between variables and does not depend on the scale of the features.\nIt can merge features from multiple sensors by performing data fusion. Mahalanobis\ndistance (namely here as DI ) is calculated by the following function:in which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−] , and is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The covariance matrix and mean vector intend to incorporate the baseline simulation. Based on the data derived from the\ndamaged system, a new observation would be far from the average of normal conditions.\nMahalanobis distances are calculated for each sensor and simulation. A matrix containing m Mahalanobis distances for i sensors is obtained from the above calculations.To automatically monitor train wheel conditions, the methodology performs outlier analysis. In Meixedo et al. and Mosleh et al. , this tool proved to be very efficient in\nclassifying the data as being related to a scenario with or without damage. Mahalanobisspace. A Gaussian distribution can be used to approximate the Mahalanobis distance, and statistical thresholds can be used to analyze outliers. By considering a mean value and standard deviation σ of the baseline feature vector, as well as the significance level α, itconsequently, when DI is equal to or higher than CB, a feature is considered to be an outlier.In the present research, the Laagrss freight train composed of five wagons is studied.\nAccording to the UIC classification, it can reach a top speed of 120 km/h . Each wagon has a tare weight of 27 t and can carry loads up to 52 t. A double freight wagon is shown incomponent. A rigid beam element was also used to connect the above-mentioned components. The numerical model of the vehicle is presented in Figure 3 and the mechanicaland geometric properties of the vehicle are detailed in Table 1. More details regarding the\nnumerical model of the freight wagons are provided by Bragança et al. .program, developed by Montenegro et al. . The model is based on a multi-layer scheme,\nsimulating the ballast, sleepers, and rails, as shown in Figure 4. The railpads, resting on the sleepers under the rail, are simulated as spring elements connecting the sleepers and\nrail. The mass of the ballast is represented by elements of discrete mass points, while the\nrails and sleepers are modeled using beam elements, adopting the appropriate material properties for each one. Finally, spring-dashpot elements are also incorporated to consider\nfoundation flexibility. Table 2 presents the properties of the track model.ties are very small, their effects on wheel-rail contact cannot be neglected . Therefore,In real conditions, the wheels are not entirely smooth and have imperfections. Despite\ntheir small size, these out-of-roundness irregularities can cause extreme variations in the wheelrail contact forces, producing vibrations on the train and track components. A periodic radial\ntread irregularity around the wheel circumference characterizes the wheel polygonization.\nAccording to Peng , for wheel polygonization, the irregularity amplitudes should be higher than 0. mm. Inherent to polygonization, some parameters can geometrically characterize the phenomenon, such as the varying wavelengths (λ) in the function of the harmonic order (θ)Two groups of polygonal wheel profiles are generated for the numerical simulations,\none for undamaged scenarios and another for damaged scenarios, based on real wheel measurements, the irregularity amplitude spectra of which are presented in Figure 6.**Figure 6.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) ( **a** ) initial polygonalFor the first group of profiles, the measurement data obtained by Johansson et al.\nfor new wheels with wavelengths comprising 20 harmonics were used . Thebetween 0.135–2. m, being the upper limit of the perimeter of the wheel. For the second group of profiles, the measurement values for four wheels with polygonal damage obtained\nby Cai et al. were considered . The wheel pr i s are characterized by the\nwavelengths in the first 30 harmonics, with the 6th to 8th harmonic orders being dominant.\nThen, different irregularity wheel profiles are generated based on the sum of sine### w ( xw ) = ∑ Aθ sin [ψ] [θ]where Aθ is the amplitude of the sine function for each wavelength, which is calculated bywhere, as wre f = 1 µm. The wheel irregularity level ( Lw ) values are selected based on the\nirregularity spectrums of Figure 6, for both cases: initial polygonization or polygonal damage . Considering phase angles ( ψθ ) to the sine functions that are uniformly and randomly distributed between 0 and 2π, several wheel irregularities are In the case of polygonal damage, simulating different amplitudes are applied atobtain two different damage severities in the function of amplitude ranges, one between\n0. mm and 0. mm (a1) and the other between 0. mm and 1. mm (a2).

A graphical representation of the numerical model is shown in Figure 9. Note that the first wheel of the first wagon on the right side isA series of accelerometers are mounted along the track to detect a polygonized wheel.\nAccording to the results demonstrated in Mosleh et al. , the location of the most promising sensors for obtaining good results is on the rail. However, the possibility of placing the sensors on the sleepers was also analyzed, since their installation is much easier. Using a virtual wayside monitoring system, acceleration measurements were\nevaluated from 16 positions, as shown in Figure 10. In this figure, the numbers 1-to-4 andsleepers on the right and left sides, respectively, while the accelerations over the sleepers are measured by sensors located on positions 9-to-12 and 13-to-16.

Once validated,Based on several speeds, loading schemes, and unevenness profiles of the rail, Table 3\nsummarizes the simulations of the undamaged and damaged scenarios. Baseline scenariosconsider vehicle speeds between 40 and 120 km/h, and four unevenness profiles are considered for rail irregularities . A total of six types of loading schemes are\nconsidered: (i) a fully loaded train, (ii) a half-loaded train, (iii) an empty train, and trains with an unbalanced load in the transversal and longitudinal directions, namely (iv) UNB1,\n(v) UNB2, and (vi) UNB3. In accordance with UIC loading guidelines , differentgravity is longitudinally and transversally offset. For baseline scenarios, 113 simulationswheels with initial polygonal profiles. Therefore, in addition to 113 analyses with healthy wheels, 30 scenarios are considered with three semi-imperfection cases, including: (i) the right wheel on the front wheelset of the first wagon, (ii) the left wheel of the rear wheelset of the third wagon; (iii) the right wheel of the rear wheelset of the fifth wagon.

By comparing the results from Figure 11a,b, it is evident that the acceleration variation for the healthy wheel\nis between − 1. to 2. m/s , while the defective one changes between − 70 to 100 m/s .**Figure 11.** Acceleration time-series on position 1 for ( **a** ) healthy wheel and wheel with semiimperfection profile, ( **b** ) damaged wheel.As the first step in the automatic damage detection method, damage-sensitive features are extracted from dynamic responses. As mentioned in Section 2.1, the ARX and CWT\nmodels are implemented and their performances as feature extractors are compared.\nTo establish a suitable ARX model order, AIC values are ascendingly ranked from\n1 to 70. An average AIC function is presented in Figure 12 based on 113 baseline analyses.\nIt is evident from this figure that after model order 40, the AIC values tend to stabilize,\nshowing that higher orders do not provide additional information. Therefore, the ARX models’ input and output orders are set to 40, and a total of 80 features are extracted. The\nsensor installed at position 5 ( yj in Equation (1)) is used as output, while each of the otherof the features extracted by the ARX models is higher than the CWT method.

Overall, the presenceregardless of the technique applied. Thus, the feature normalization step is implemented**Figure 13.** Feature extraction for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–feature 3, ( **b** ) ARX–feature 36, ( **c** ) CWT–featureout to obtain indicators that are more sensitive to damage and less sensitive to EOVs. The Latent Variable Method PCA is applied for data normalization. As explained in Section 5.1,\nfor all 173 train passages, 3-dimensional CWT-double-PCA-based feature matrices of\n173 × 468 are calculated for each sensor. At the same time, the ARX model is implementedsensor. Note that the PCA matrices have the same dimensions as the feature extraction step In Figure 14, the same four features shown in Figure 13 for sensor 1 are shown after\nimplementing PCA for all undamaged and damaged scenarios. During the modeling process, components with a cumulative percentage of variances higher than 80% are discarded. Therefore, the number of discarded rows is seventeen and two for CWT-doublePCA-based and ARX-PCA-based methods, respectively. The results obtained are quite\ndifferent depending on the method applied as a feature extractor. A reduction in theobserved in Figure 14a,b. However, CWT-double-PCA-based parameters in Figure 14c,d,\nshow a more effective normalization of the baseline features.

Therefore, in the first stage, Mahalanobis\ndistance transfers 468 CWT-double-PCA-based parameters into one column (173 × 1) for each sensor and train passage. At the same time, 80 ARX-PCA-based parameters are\nconverted to a single damage-sensitive feature (173 × 1). Figure 15 demonstrates theARX-PCA and CWT-double-PCA considering sensor 1. It is possible to observe that this process significantly improves damage detection sensitivity for both approaches.**Figure 15.** Features fusion for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based, ( **b** ) CWT–double–PCA–based.Afterwards, in the second stage, all sensor information is merged to improve the sensitivity to the damage even more.

Therefore, it is possible to conclude that using ARX models as feature extractors**Figure 17.** Automatic wheel defect detection ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based ( **b** ) CWT–double–PCA–based.To reduce the time of installation and maintenance costs, it is necessary to obtain an\noptimal number of sensors, as well as a suitable location to install them without compromising the quality of the detection. As a result, a parametric study is carried out using\naccelerometers at distinct locations. In this analysis, only CWT is used for feature extraction because, as shown in Figure 17b, it is the best technique (with no false positives) compared(as presented in Figure 10) in terms of the total number (two, four, and six) are analyzed and the effectiveness of the detection methodology is demonstrated in Figure 18. The results concluded that even with two sensors (one on each side of the rail), the proposed**Figure 18.** Automatic polygonized wheel detection based on CWT technique considering: ( **a** ) sixIn the previous section, the proposed approach to detect a defective wheel from a healthy one was implemented for accelerometers located on the rail.

Thus, it is essential to develop automatic methodologies for detecting different Despite the widespread research on railway defect detection, to the knowledge of the authors, the reported literature on automatic wheel polygonization identification has been limited so far. Therefore, taking advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies, it isan early stage. The detection of polygonized wheels is largely carried out using accelerometers mounted on the vehicle.

In this sense, different simulations of realistic scenarios of dynamicconditions. On the other hand, to overcome some unpredictable oscillations in the measured responses and consequent failures in damage detection, some options can be taken.\nIn more complex structures, such as bridges and viaducts, there should be a greater susceptibility to damage when compared to areas of track sections on the foundation ground. If the structures are damaged, they may camouflage or cause false warnings. In a practical context, the use of sensors in an area of the track less prone to damage and where vibrationmethodology.

Moreover, ai, bk, ma, and mb are the parameters and the orders of the output and Initially, it is difficult to determine the most appropriate ARX model order. The key issue is that higher-order models could better match the data, but they may not generalize\nto other datasets. Otherwise, a low-order model is unlikely to capture the underlying physical system response. Several authors have noted the difficulty of defining a unique order for ARX models. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is reported to be one of the most effective optimization techniques . Based on the exchange between fit accuracy and the number of estimated parameters, AIC measures the goodness-of-fit of an estimatedparameters, respectively, and ε is the average sum-of-square residual ( SSR ) errors. To find out an optimum order, one should examine a wide range of orders and choose the orderStudies conducted by Li et al. showed good results in gearbox fault detection.\nCWT produces a two-dimensional set of coefficients from the analyzed signal. Although the Fourier transforms typically use sine waves as the basis for decomposition, other functionscan be selected for the wavelet shape due to signal properties. Two parameters define wavelet analysis: scale and translation. The CWT ( T ) of the signal x ( t ) is determined aswhere a and b are the scale and translation parameters, and ψ [∗] is the complex conjugate of the mother wavelet T that involves a continuous function in both time and frequency domains.\nAfter the implementation of a CWT on the evaluated signals, a PCA is performed\nfollowed by the extraction of four statistical parameters, resulting in significant data compression . Based on the p -by- q matrix X containing the extracted CWT features from the original signal evaluated by each sensor, where p is the measurement points number and q is the wavelets coefficients number, the principal components can be determinedwhere Ss represents the scores matrix, and T is a q -by- q orthonormal linear transformation matrix. In addition, four statistical parameters are extracted from the scores, Ss, including the root mean square (RMS), standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. Thus, a matrix p -by- q is transformed into a k -by- q matrix, where k equals 4. Consequently, a total of k × qenvironmental and operational variations (EOVs). For example, in damage detection, itare mostly sensitive to damage . Therefore, implementing a latent variable method,\nnamely the PCA, may efficiently reduce EOVs influences, without requiring the direct measurement of those effects. According to Bro and Smilde , PCA is a powerful and versatile method capable of providing an overview of complex multivariate data. PCA can be used to find and quantify patterns, generate new hypotheses, detect outliers, or find\nBy considering a m -by- f matrix X, taking into account features extracted from the dynamic responses, where m represents the train passages and f represents the number of\nfeatures extracted from sensors (i.e., k × q ), a transformation to another set of f features, Ss,\nis obtained by considering Equation (4). Considering the baseline condition, the covariance matrix ( C ) of the features is related to the covariance matrix of the scores Λ, as follows:where, Λ and T are matrices calculated by the singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix C . The columns of T are the eigenvectors and the diagonal matrix Λ, including\nthe eigenvalues of the matrix C in descending order. Thus, the eigenvalues stored in Λ areIt is possible to divide matrix Λ into two matrices with the first n eigenvalues and the remaining f-n eigenvalues. Determining the number of n -components is one of the\nchallenges in multivariate data interpretation. In this research study, n -components are\ndiscarded when the cumulative percentage of variance reaches 80% . Once n\nhas been selected, Equation (4) can be used to calculate the f-n components of matrix S. The transformation matrix T [ˆ] is constructed by the remaining f-n columns of matrix T . Using\nthe following function, the f-n components can be remapped to the main space:where, FPCA is m -by- f matrix of PCA features which is less sensitive to EOVs. Every sensorindex definition, is easy to implement and fast to process . For each simulation, the MD is considered to calculate a damage index (DI). Several damage identification studies haveDI . The MD is a well-known distance metric because it measures the distance\nbetween two points in a feature space containing two or more variables . Furthermore,\nit considers correlations between variables and does not depend on the scale of the features.\nIt can merge features from multiple sensors by performing data fusion. Mahalanobis\ndistance (namely here as DI ) is calculated by the following function:in which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−] , and is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The covariance matrix and mean vector intend to incorporate the baseline simulation. Based on the data derived from the\ndamaged system, a new observation would be far from the average of normal conditions.\nMahalanobis distances are calculated for each sensor and simulation. A matrix containing m Mahalanobis distances for i sensors is obtained from the above calculations.To automatically monitor train wheel conditions, the methodology performs outlier analysis.

A Gaussian distribution can be used to approximate the Mahalanobis distance, and statistical thresholds can be used to analyze outliers. By considering a mean value and standard deviation σ of the baseline feature vector, as well as the significance level α, itconsequently, when DI is equal to or higher than CB, a feature is considered to be an outlier.In the present research, the Laagrss freight train composed of five wagons is studied.\nAccording to the UIC classification, it can reach a top speed of 120 km/h .

Therefore,In real conditions, the wheels are not entirely smooth and have imperfections. Despite\ntheir small size, these out-of-roundness irregularities can cause extreme variations in the wheelrail contact forces, producing vibrations on the train and track components. A periodic radial\ntread irregularity around the wheel circumference characterizes the wheel polygonization.\nAccording to Peng , for wheel polygonization, the irregularity amplitudes should be higher than 0. mm. Inherent to polygonization, some parameters can geometrically characterize the phenomenon, such as the varying wavelengths (λ) in the function of the harmonic order (θ)Two groups of polygonal wheel profiles are generated for the numerical simulations,\none for undamaged scenarios and another for damaged scenarios, based on real wheel measurements, the irregularity amplitude spectra of which are presented in Figure 6.**Figure 6.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) ( **a** ) initial polygonalFor the first group of profiles, the measurement data obtained by Johansson et al.\nfor new wheels with wavelengths comprising 20 harmonics were used .

By comparing the results from Figure 11a,b, it is evident that the acceleration variation for the healthy wheel\nis between − 1. to 2. m/s , while the defective one changes between − 70 to 100 m/s .**Figure 11.** Acceleration time-series on position 1 for ( **a** ) healthy wheel and wheel with semiimperfection profile, ( **b** ) damaged wheel.As the first step in the automatic damage detection method, damage-sensitive features are extracted from dynamic responses. As mentioned in Section 2.1, the ARX and CWT\nmodels are implemented and their performances as feature extractors are compared.\nTo establish a suitable ARX model order, AIC values are ascendingly ranked from\n1 to 70. An average AIC function is presented in Figure 12 based on 113 baseline analyses.\nIt is evident from this figure that after model order 40, the AIC values tend to stabilize,\nshowing that higher orders do not provide additional information. Therefore, the ARX models’ input and output orders are set to 40, and a total of 80 features are extracted.

With the application of these intelligent techniques, it\nis not intended to completely replace the visual inspections already used for many decades,\nbut rather, the creation of a compatible procedure. Traditional visual inspection and control techniques are expensive, occur at intervals, and are prone to errors, it is important to\nmotivate the widespread use of Structural Integrity Monitoring (SIE) systems, especially in\nrecent infrastructures or in systems of high value to society, as in the case of railway systems . Thus, it is essential to develop automatic methodologies for detecting different Despite the widespread research on railway defect detection, to the knowledge of the authors, the reported literature on automatic wheel polygonization identification has been limited so far. Therefore, taking advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies, it isan early stage. The detection of polygonized wheels is largely carried out using accelerometers mounted on the vehicle.

On the other hand, to overcome some unpredictable oscillations in the measured responses and consequent failures in damage detection, some options can be taken.\nIn more complex structures, such as bridges and viaducts, there should be a greater susceptibility to damage when compared to areas of track sections on the foundation ground. If the structures are damaged, they may camouflage or cause false warnings. In a practical context, the use of sensors in an area of the track less prone to damage and where vibrationmethodology.

Moreover, ai, bk, ma, and mb are the parameters and the orders of the output and Initially, it is difficult to determine the most appropriate ARX model order. The key issue is that higher-order models could better match the data, but they may not generalize\nto other datasets. Otherwise, a low-order model is unlikely to capture the underlying physical system response. Several authors have noted the difficulty of defining a unique order for ARX models. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is reported to be one of the most effective optimization techniques . Based on the exchange between fit accuracy and the number of estimated parameters, AIC measures the goodness-of-fit of an estimatedparameters, respectively, and ε is the average sum-of-square residual ( SSR ) errors. To find out an optimum order, one should examine a wide range of orders and choose the orderStudies conducted by Li et al. showed good results in gearbox fault detection.\nCWT produces a two-dimensional set of coefficients from the analyzed signal. Although the Fourier transforms typically use sine waves as the basis for decomposition, other functionscan be selected for the wavelet shape due to signal properties. Two parameters define wavelet analysis: scale and translation. The CWT ( T ) of the signal x ( t ) is determined aswhere a and b are the scale and translation parameters, and ψ [∗] is the complex conjugate of the mother wavelet T that involves a continuous function in both time and frequency domains.\nAfter the implementation of a CWT on the evaluated signals, a PCA is performed\nfollowed by the extraction of four statistical parameters, resulting in significant data compression . Based on the p -by- q matrix X containing the extracted CWT features from the original signal evaluated by each sensor, where p is the measurement points number and q is the wavelets coefficients number, the principal components can be determinedwhere Ss represents the scores matrix, and T is a q -by- q orthonormal linear transformation matrix. In addition, four statistical parameters are extracted from the scores, Ss, including the root mean square (RMS), standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. Thus, a matrix p -by- q is transformed into a k -by- q matrix, where k equals 4. Consequently, a total of k × qenvironmental and operational variations (EOVs). For example, in damage detection, itare mostly sensitive to damage . Therefore, implementing a latent variable method,\nnamely the PCA, may efficiently reduce EOVs influences, without requiring the direct measurement of those effects. According to Bro and Smilde , PCA is a powerful and versatile method capable of providing an overview of complex multivariate data. PCA can be used to find and quantify patterns, generate new hypotheses, detect outliers, or find\nBy considering a m -by- f matrix X, taking into account features extracted from the dynamic responses, where m represents the train passages and f represents the number of\nfeatures extracted from sensors (i.e., k × q ), a transformation to another set of f features, Ss,\nis obtained by considering Equation (4). Considering the baseline condition, the covariance matrix ( C ) of the features is related to the covariance matrix of the scores Λ, as follows:where, Λ and T are matrices calculated by the singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix C . The columns of T are the eigenvectors and the diagonal matrix Λ, including\nthe eigenvalues of the matrix C in descending order. Thus, the eigenvalues stored in Λ areIt is possible to divide matrix Λ into two matrices with the first n eigenvalues and the remaining f-n eigenvalues. Determining the number of n -components is one of the\nchallenges in multivariate data interpretation. In this research study, n -components are\ndiscarded when the cumulative percentage of variance reaches 80% . Once n\nhas been selected, Equation (4) can be used to calculate the f-n components of matrix S. The transformation matrix T [ˆ] is constructed by the remaining f-n columns of matrix T . Using\nthe following function, the f-n components can be remapped to the main space:where, FPCA is m -by- f matrix of PCA features which is less sensitive to EOVs. Every sensorindex definition, is easy to implement and fast to process . For each simulation, the MD is considered to calculate a damage index (DI). Several damage identification studies haveDI . The MD is a well-known distance metric because it measures the distance\nbetween two points in a feature space containing two or more variables . Furthermore,\nit considers correlations between variables and does not depend on the scale of the features.\nIt can merge features from multiple sensors by performing data fusion. Mahalanobis\ndistance (namely here as DI ) is calculated by the following function:in which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−] , and is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The covariance matrix and mean vector intend to incorporate the baseline simulation. Based on the data derived from the\ndamaged system, a new observation would be far from the average of normal conditions.\nMahalanobis distances are calculated for each sensor and simulation. A matrix containing m Mahalanobis distances for i sensors is obtained from the above calculations.To automatically monitor train wheel conditions, the methodology performs outlier analysis.

A Gaussian distribution can be used to approximate the Mahalanobis distance, and statistical thresholds can be used to analyze outliers. By considering a mean value and standard deviation σ of the baseline feature vector, as well as the significance level α, itconsequently, when DI is equal to or higher than CB, a feature is considered to be an outlier.In the present research, the Laagrss freight train composed of five wagons is studied.\nAccording to the UIC classification, it can reach a top speed of 120 km/h .

Therefore,In real conditions, the wheels are not entirely smooth and have imperfections. Despite\ntheir small size, these out-of-roundness irregularities can cause extreme variations in the wheelrail contact forces, producing vibrations on the train and track components. A periodic radial\ntread irregularity around the wheel circumference characterizes the wheel polygonization.\nAccording to Peng , for wheel polygonization, the irregularity amplitudes should be higher than 0. mm. Inherent to polygonization, some parameters can geometrically characterize the phenomenon, such as the varying wavelengths (λ) in the function of the harmonic order (θ)Two groups of polygonal wheel profiles are generated for the numerical simulations,\none for undamaged scenarios and another for damaged scenarios, based on real wheel measurements, the irregularity amplitude spectra of which are presented in Figure 6.**Figure 6.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) ( **a** ) initial polygonalFor the first group of profiles, the measurement data obtained by Johansson et al.\nfor new wheels with wavelengths comprising 20 harmonics were used .

A graphical representation of the numerical model is shown in Figure 9. Note that the first wheel of the first wagon on the right side isA series of accelerometers are mounted along the track to detect a polygonized wheel.\nAccording to the results demonstrated in Mosleh et al. , the location of the most promising sensors for obtaining good results is on the rail. However, the possibility of placing the sensors on the sleepers was also analyzed, since their installation is much easier. Using a virtual wayside monitoring system, acceleration measurements were\nevaluated from 16 positions, as shown in Figure 10.

Once validated,Based on several speeds, loading schemes, and unevenness profiles of the rail, Table 3\nsummarizes the simulations of the undamaged and damaged scenarios. Baseline scenariosconsider vehicle speeds between 40 and 120 km/h, and four unevenness profiles are considered for rail irregularities . A total of six types of loading schemes are\nconsidered: (i) a fully loaded train, (ii) a half-loaded train, (iii) an empty train, and trains with an unbalanced load in the transversal and longitudinal directions, namely (iv) UNB1,\n(v) UNB2, and (vi) UNB3. In accordance with UIC loading guidelines , differentgravity is longitudinally and transversally offset. For baseline scenarios, 113 simulationswheels with initial polygonal profiles. Therefore, in addition to 113 analyses with healthy wheels, 30 scenarios are considered with three semi-imperfection cases, including: (i) the right wheel on the front wheelset of the first wagon, (ii) the left wheel of the rear wheelset of the third wagon; (iii) the right wheel of the rear wheelset of the fifth wagon.

By comparing the results from Figure 11a,b, it is evident that the acceleration variation for the healthy wheel\nis between − 1. to 2. m/s , while the defective one changes between − 70 to 100 m/s .**Figure 11.** Acceleration time-series on position 1 for ( **a** ) healthy wheel and wheel with semiimperfection profile, ( **b** ) damaged wheel.As the first step in the automatic damage detection method, damage-sensitive features are extracted from dynamic responses. As mentioned in Section 2.1, the ARX and CWT\nmodels are implemented and their performances as feature extractors are compared.\nTo establish a suitable ARX model order, AIC values are ascendingly ranked from\n1 to 70. An average AIC function is presented in Figure 12 based on 113 baseline analyses.\nIt is evident from this figure that after model order 40, the AIC values tend to stabilize,\nshowing that higher orders do not provide additional information. Therefore, the ARX models’ input and output orders are set to 40, and a total of 80 features are extracted. The\nsensor installed at position 5 ( yj in Equation (1)) is used as output, while each of the otherof the features extracted by the ARX models is higher than the CWT method.

Therefore, in the first stage, Mahalanobis\ndistance transfers 468 CWT-double-PCA-based parameters into one column (173 × 1) for each sensor and train passage. At the same time, 80 ARX-PCA-based parameters are\nconverted to a single damage-sensitive feature (173 × 1). Figure 15 demonstrates theARX-PCA and CWT-double-PCA considering sensor 1.

With the application of these intelligent techniques, it\nis not intended to completely replace the visual inspections already used for many decades,\nbut rather, the creation of a compatible procedure. Traditional visual inspection and control techniques are expensive, occur at intervals, and are prone to errors, it is important to\nmotivate the widespread use of Structural Integrity Monitoring (SIE) systems, especially in\nrecent infrastructures or in systems of high value to society, as in the case of railway systems . Thus, it is essential to develop automatic methodologies for detecting different Despite the widespread research on railway defect detection, to the knowledge of the authors, the reported literature on automatic wheel polygonization identification has been limited so far. Therefore, taking advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies, it isan early stage. The detection of polygonized wheels is largely carried out using accelerometers mounted on the vehicle.

The studies carriedidentifying singular irregularities on the wheel surface (i.e., wheel flat). In this context, itcomprehensive number of damages, namely the ones that may occur along the entire Several methods have been used for feature extraction, which converts time-series\ndata into more condensed information, allowing damage to be more easily observed.\nSymbolic data, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) [15–17], principal component analysis\n(PCA) , and autoregressive models [15–17] are examples of effective techniques for\nextracting damage-sensitive features for both static and dynamic monitoring.

Moreover, ai, bk, ma, and mb are the parameters and the orders of the output and Initially, it is difficult to determine the most appropriate ARX model order. The key issue is that higher-order models could better match the data, but they may not generalize\nto other datasets. Otherwise, a low-order model is unlikely to capture the underlying physical system response. Several authors have noted the difficulty of defining a unique order for ARX models. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is reported to be one of the most effective optimization techniques . Based on the exchange between fit accuracy and the number of estimated parameters, AIC measures the goodness-of-fit of an estimatedparameters, respectively, and ε is the average sum-of-square residual ( SSR ) errors. To find out an optimum order, one should examine a wide range of orders and choose the orderStudies conducted by Li et al. showed good results in gearbox fault detection.\nCWT produces a two-dimensional set of coefficients from the analyzed signal. Although the Fourier transforms typically use sine waves as the basis for decomposition, other functionscan be selected for the wavelet shape due to signal properties. Two parameters define wavelet analysis: scale and translation. The CWT ( T ) of the signal x ( t ) is determined aswhere a and b are the scale and translation parameters, and ψ [∗] is the complex conjugate of the mother wavelet T that involves a continuous function in both time and frequency domains.\nAfter the implementation of a CWT on the evaluated signals, a PCA is performed\nfollowed by the extraction of four statistical parameters, resulting in significant data compression . Based on the p -by- q matrix X containing the extracted CWT features from the original signal evaluated by each sensor, where p is the measurement points number and q is the wavelets coefficients number, the principal components can be determinedwhere Ss represents the scores matrix, and T is a q -by- q orthonormal linear transformation matrix. In addition, four statistical parameters are extracted from the scores, Ss, including the root mean square (RMS), standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. Thus, a matrix p -by- q is transformed into a k -by- q matrix, where k equals 4. Consequently, a total of k × qenvironmental and operational variations (EOVs). For example, in damage detection, itare mostly sensitive to damage . Therefore, implementing a latent variable method,\nnamely the PCA, may efficiently reduce EOVs influences, without requiring the direct measurement of those effects. According to Bro and Smilde , PCA is a powerful and versatile method capable of providing an overview of complex multivariate data. PCA can be used to find and quantify patterns, generate new hypotheses, detect outliers, or find\nBy considering a m -by- f matrix X, taking into account features extracted from the dynamic responses, where m represents the train passages and f represents the number of\nfeatures extracted from sensors (i.e., k × q ), a transformation to another set of f features, Ss,\nis obtained by considering Equation (4). Considering the baseline condition, the covariance matrix ( C ) of the features is related to the covariance matrix of the scores Λ, as follows:where, Λ and T are matrices calculated by the singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix C . The columns of T are the eigenvectors and the diagonal matrix Λ, including\nthe eigenvalues of the matrix C in descending order. Thus, the eigenvalues stored in Λ areIt is possible to divide matrix Λ into two matrices with the first n eigenvalues and the remaining f-n eigenvalues. Determining the number of n -components is one of the\nchallenges in multivariate data interpretation. In this research study, n -components are\ndiscarded when the cumulative percentage of variance reaches 80% . Once n\nhas been selected, Equation (4) can be used to calculate the f-n components of matrix S. The transformation matrix T [ˆ] is constructed by the remaining f-n columns of matrix T . Using\nthe following function, the f-n components can be remapped to the main space:where, FPCA is m -by- f matrix of PCA features which is less sensitive to EOVs. Every sensorindex definition, is easy to implement and fast to process . For each simulation, the MD is considered to calculate a damage index (DI). Several damage identification studies haveDI . The MD is a well-known distance metric because it measures the distance\nbetween two points in a feature space containing two or more variables . Furthermore,\nit considers correlations between variables and does not depend on the scale of the features.\nIt can merge features from multiple sensors by performing data fusion. Mahalanobis\ndistance (namely here as DI ) is calculated by the following function:in which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−] , and is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The covariance matrix and mean vector intend to incorporate the baseline simulation. Based on the data derived from the\ndamaged system, a new observation would be far from the average of normal conditions.\nMahalanobis distances are calculated for each sensor and simulation. A matrix containing m Mahalanobis distances for i sensors is obtained from the above calculations.To automatically monitor train wheel conditions, the methodology performs outlier analysis.

Therefore,In real conditions, the wheels are not entirely smooth and have imperfections. Despite\ntheir small size, these out-of-roundness irregularities can cause extreme variations in the wheelrail contact forces, producing vibrations on the train and track components. A periodic radial\ntread irregularity around the wheel circumference characterizes the wheel polygonization.\nAccording to Peng , for wheel polygonization, the irregularity amplitudes should be higher than 0. mm. Inherent to polygonization, some parameters can geometrically characterize the phenomenon, such as the varying wavelengths (λ) in the function of the harmonic order (θ)Two groups of polygonal wheel profiles are generated for the numerical simulations,\none for undamaged scenarios and another for damaged scenarios, based on real wheel measurements, the irregularity amplitude spectra of which are presented in Figure 6.**Figure 6.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) ( **a** ) initial polygonalFor the first group of profiles, the measurement data obtained by Johansson et al.\nfor new wheels with wavelengths comprising 20 harmonics were used .

Therefore, the ARX models’ input and output orders are set to 40, and a total of 80 features are extracted. The\nsensor installed at position 5 ( yj in Equation (1)) is used as output, while each of the otherof the features extracted by the ARX models is higher than the CWT method.

In Figure 13b,c, a comparison of baseline and damaged scenarios shows similar variations in amplitude. In Figure 13d, the amplitude variation between healthy\nand damaged scenarios is evident, as the amplitude does not change much for the first\n143 passages, and then increases, which may indicate a wheel defect. Overall, the presenceregardless of the technique applied. Thus, the feature normalization step is implemented**Figure 13.** Feature extraction for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–feature 3, ( **b** ) ARX–feature 36, ( **c** ) CWT–featureout to obtain indicators that are more sensitive to damage and less sensitive to EOVs. The Latent Variable Method PCA is applied for data normalization. As explained in Section 5.1,\nfor all 173 train passages, 3-dimensional CWT-double-PCA-based feature matrices of\n173 × 468 are calculated for each sensor. At the same time, the ARX model is implementedsensor. Note that the PCA matrices have the same dimensions as the feature extraction step In Figure 14, the same four features shown in Figure 13 for sensor 1 are shown after\nimplementing PCA for all undamaged and damaged scenarios. During the modeling process, components with a cumulative percentage of variances higher than 80% are discarded. Therefore, the number of discarded rows is seventeen and two for CWT-doublePCA-based and ARX-PCA-based methods, respectively. The results obtained are quite\ndifferent depending on the method applied as a feature extractor. A reduction in theobserved in Figure 14a,b. However, CWT-double-PCA-based parameters in Figure 14c,d,\nshow a more effective normalization of the baseline features.

Therefore, in the first stage, Mahalanobis\ndistance transfers 468 CWT-double-PCA-based parameters into one column (173 × 1) for each sensor and train passage. At the same time, 80 ARX-PCA-based parameters are\nconverted to a single damage-sensitive feature (173 × 1). Figure 15 demonstrates theARX-PCA and CWT-double-PCA considering sensor 1. It is possible to observe that this process significantly improves damage detection sensitivity for both approaches.**Figure 15.** Features fusion for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based, ( **b** ) CWT–double–PCA–based.Afterwards, in the second stage, all sensor information is merged to improve the sensitivity to the damage even more.

As a result, a parametric study is carried out using\naccelerometers at distinct locations. In this analysis, only CWT is used for feature extraction because, as shown in Figure 17b, it is the best technique (with no false positives) compared(as presented in Figure 10) in terms of the total number (two, four, and six) are analyzed and the effectiveness of the detection methodology is demonstrated in Figure 18.

Thus, it is essential to develop automatic methodologies for detecting different Despite the widespread research on railway defect detection, to the knowledge of the authors, the reported literature on automatic wheel polygonization identification has been limited so far. Therefore, taking advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies, it isan early stage. The detection of polygonized wheels is largely carried out using accelerometers mounted on the vehicle.

Moreover, ai, bk, ma, and mb are the parameters and the orders of the output and Initially, it is difficult to determine the most appropriate ARX model order. The key issue is that higher-order models could better match the data, but they may not generalize\nto other datasets. Otherwise, a low-order model is unlikely to capture the underlying physical system response. Several authors have noted the difficulty of defining a unique order for ARX models. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is reported to be one of the most effective optimization techniques . Based on the exchange between fit accuracy and the number of estimated parameters, AIC measures the goodness-of-fit of an estimatedparameters, respectively, and ε is the average sum-of-square residual ( SSR ) errors. To find out an optimum order, one should examine a wide range of orders and choose the orderStudies conducted by Li et al. showed good results in gearbox fault detection.\nCWT produces a two-dimensional set of coefficients from the analyzed signal. Although the Fourier transforms typically use sine waves as the basis for decomposition, other functionscan be selected for the wavelet shape due to signal properties. Two parameters define wavelet analysis: scale and translation. The CWT ( T ) of the signal x ( t ) is determined aswhere a and b are the scale and translation parameters, and ψ [∗] is the complex conjugate of the mother wavelet T that involves a continuous function in both time and frequency domains.\nAfter the implementation of a CWT on the evaluated signals, a PCA is performed\nfollowed by the extraction of four statistical parameters, resulting in significant data compression . Based on the p -by- q matrix X containing the extracted CWT features from the original signal evaluated by each sensor, where p is the measurement points number and q is the wavelets coefficients number, the principal components can be determinedwhere Ss represents the scores matrix, and T is a q -by- q orthonormal linear transformation matrix. In addition, four statistical parameters are extracted from the scores, Ss, including the root mean square (RMS), standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. Thus, a matrix p -by- q is transformed into a k -by- q matrix, where k equals 4. Consequently, a total of k × qenvironmental and operational variations (EOVs). For example, in damage detection, itare mostly sensitive to damage . Therefore, implementing a latent variable method,\nnamely the PCA, may efficiently reduce EOVs influences, without requiring the direct measurement of those effects.

PCA can be used to find and quantify patterns, generate new hypotheses, detect outliers, or find\nBy considering a m -by- f matrix X, taking into account features extracted from the dynamic responses, where m represents the train passages and f represents the number of\nfeatures extracted from sensors (i.e., k × q ), a transformation to another set of f features, Ss,\nis obtained by considering Equation (4). Considering the baseline condition, the covariance matrix ( C ) of the features is related to the covariance matrix of the scores Λ, as follows:where, Λ and T are matrices calculated by the singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix C . The columns of T are the eigenvectors and the diagonal matrix Λ, including\nthe eigenvalues of the matrix C in descending order. Thus, the eigenvalues stored in Λ areIt is possible to divide matrix Λ into two matrices with the first n eigenvalues and the remaining f-n eigenvalues.

In this research study, n -components are\ndiscarded when the cumulative percentage of variance reaches 80% . Once n\nhas been selected, Equation (4) can be used to calculate the f-n components of matrix S. The transformation matrix T [ˆ] is constructed by the remaining f-n columns of matrix T . Using\nthe following function, the f-n components can be remapped to the main space:where, FPCA is m -by- f matrix of PCA features which is less sensitive to EOVs. Every sensorindex definition, is easy to implement and fast to process . For each simulation, the MD is considered to calculate a damage index (DI). Several damage identification studies haveDI . The MD is a well-known distance metric because it measures the distance\nbetween two points in a feature space containing two or more variables . Furthermore,\nit considers correlations between variables and does not depend on the scale of the features.\nIt can merge features from multiple sensors by performing data fusion. Mahalanobis\ndistance (namely here as DI ) is calculated by the following function:in which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−] , and is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The covariance matrix and mean vector intend to incorporate the baseline simulation. Based on the data derived from the\ndamaged system, a new observation would be far from the average of normal conditions.\nMahalanobis distances are calculated for each sensor and simulation. A matrix containing m Mahalanobis distances for i sensors is obtained from the above calculations.To automatically monitor train wheel conditions, the methodology performs outlier analysis.

Therefore,In real conditions, the wheels are not entirely smooth and have imperfections. Despite\ntheir small size, these out-of-roundness irregularities can cause extreme variations in the wheelrail contact forces, producing vibrations on the train and track components. A periodic radial\ntread irregularity around the wheel circumference characterizes the wheel polygonization.\nAccording to Peng , for wheel polygonization, the irregularity amplitudes should be higher than 0. mm. Inherent to polygonization, some parameters can geometrically characterize the phenomenon, such as the varying wavelengths (λ) in the function of the harmonic order (θ)Two groups of polygonal wheel profiles are generated for the numerical simulations,\none for undamaged scenarios and another for damaged scenarios, based on real wheel measurements, the irregularity amplitude spectra of which are presented in Figure 6.**Figure 6.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) ( **a** ) initial polygonalFor the first group of profiles, the measurement data obtained by Johansson et al.\nfor new wheels with wavelengths comprising 20 harmonics were used .

A graphical representation of the numerical model is shown in Figure 9. Note that the first wheel of the first wagon on the right side isA series of accelerometers are mounted along the track to detect a polygonized wheel.\nAccording to the results demonstrated in Mosleh et al. , the location of the most promising sensors for obtaining good results is on the rail. However, the possibility of placing the sensors on the sleepers was also analyzed, since their installation is much easier. Using a virtual wayside monitoring system, acceleration measurements were\nevaluated from 16 positions, as shown in Figure 10. In this figure, the numbers 1-to-4 andsleepers on the right and left sides, respectively, while the accelerations over the sleepers are measured by sensors located on positions 9-to-12 and 13-to-16.

Once validated,Based on several speeds, loading schemes, and unevenness profiles of the rail, Table 3\nsummarizes the simulations of the undamaged and damaged scenarios. Baseline scenariosconsider vehicle speeds between 40 and 120 km/h, and four unevenness profiles are considered for rail irregularities . A total of six types of loading schemes are\nconsidered: (i) a fully loaded train, (ii) a half-loaded train, (iii) an empty train, and trains with an unbalanced load in the transversal and longitudinal directions, namely (iv) UNB1,\n(v) UNB2, and (vi) UNB3. In accordance with UIC loading guidelines , differentgravity is longitudinally and transversally offset. For baseline scenarios, 113 simulationswheels with initial polygonal profiles. Therefore, in addition to 113 analyses with healthy wheels, 30 scenarios are considered with three semi-imperfection cases, including: (i) the right wheel on the front wheelset of the first wagon, (ii) the left wheel of the rear wheelset of the third wagon; (iii) the right wheel of the rear wheelset of the fifth wagon.

By comparing the results from Figure 11a,b, it is evident that the acceleration variation for the healthy wheel\nis between − 1. to 2. m/s , while the defective one changes between − 70 to 100 m/s .**Figure 11.** Acceleration time-series on position 1 for ( **a** ) healthy wheel and wheel with semiimperfection profile, ( **b** ) damaged wheel.As the first step in the automatic damage detection method, damage-sensitive features are extracted from dynamic responses. As mentioned in Section 2.1, the ARX and CWT\nmodels are implemented and their performances as feature extractors are compared.\nTo establish a suitable ARX model order, AIC values are ascendingly ranked from\n1 to 70. An average AIC function is presented in Figure 12 based on 113 baseline analyses.\nIt is evident from this figure that after model order 40, the AIC values tend to stabilize,\nshowing that higher orders do not provide additional information. Therefore, the ARX models’ input and output orders are set to 40, and a total of 80 features are extracted. The\nsensor installed at position 5 ( yj in Equation (1)) is used as output, while each of the otherof the features extracted by the ARX models is higher than the CWT method.

In Figure 13b,c, a comparison of baseline and damaged scenarios shows similar variations in amplitude. In Figure 13d, the amplitude variation between healthy\nand damaged scenarios is evident, as the amplitude does not change much for the first\n143 passages, and then increases, which may indicate a wheel defect. Overall, the presenceregardless of the technique applied. Thus, the feature normalization step is implemented**Figure 13.** Feature extraction for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–feature 3, ( **b** ) ARX–feature 36, ( **c** ) CWT–featureout to obtain indicators that are more sensitive to damage and less sensitive to EOVs. The Latent Variable Method PCA is applied for data normalization. As explained in Section 5.1,\nfor all 173 train passages, 3-dimensional CWT-double-PCA-based feature matrices of\n173 × 468 are calculated for each sensor. At the same time, the ARX model is implementedsensor. Note that the PCA matrices have the same dimensions as the feature extraction step In Figure 14, the same four features shown in Figure 13 for sensor 1 are shown after\nimplementing PCA for all undamaged and damaged scenarios. During the modeling process, components with a cumulative percentage of variances higher than 80% are discarded. Therefore, the number of discarded rows is seventeen and two for CWT-doublePCA-based and ARX-PCA-based methods, respectively. The results obtained are quite\ndifferent depending on the method applied as a feature extractor. A reduction in theobserved in Figure 14a,b. However, CWT-double-PCA-based parameters in Figure 14c,d,\nshow a more effective normalization of the baseline features.

Therefore, in the first stage, Mahalanobis\ndistance transfers 468 CWT-double-PCA-based parameters into one column (173 × 1) for each sensor and train passage. At the same time, 80 ARX-PCA-based parameters are\nconverted to a single damage-sensitive feature (173 × 1). Figure 15 demonstrates theARX-PCA and CWT-double-PCA considering sensor 1. It is possible to observe that this process significantly improves damage detection sensitivity for both approaches.**Figure 15.** Features fusion for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based, ( **b** ) CWT–double–PCA–based.Afterwards, in the second stage, all sensor information is merged to improve the sensitivity to the damage even more.

Therefore, it is possible to conclude that using ARX models as feature extractors**Figure 17.** Automatic wheel defect detection ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based ( **b** ) CWT–double–PCA–based.To reduce the time of installation and maintenance costs, it is necessary to obtain an\noptimal number of sensors, as well as a suitable location to install them without compromising the quality of the detection. As a result, a parametric study is carried out using\naccelerometers at distinct locations. In this analysis, only CWT is used for feature extraction because, as shown in Figure 17b, it is the best technique (with no false positives) compared(as presented in Figure 10) in terms of the total number (two, four, and six) are analyzed and the effectiveness of the detection methodology is demonstrated in Figure 18. The results concluded that even with two sensors (one on each side of the rail), the proposed**Figure 18.** Automatic polygonized wheel detection based on CWT technique considering: ( **a** ) sixIn the previous section, the proposed approach to detect a defective wheel from a healthy one was implemented for accelerometers located on the rail.

Thus, it is essential to develop automatic methodologies for detecting different Despite the widespread research on railway defect detection, to the knowledge of the authors, the reported literature on automatic wheel polygonization identification has been limited so far. Therefore, taking advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies, it isan early stage. The detection of polygonized wheels is largely carried out using accelerometers mounted on the vehicle.

On the other hand, to overcome some unpredictable oscillations in the measured responses and consequent failures in damage detection, some options can be taken.\nIn more complex structures, such as bridges and viaducts, there should be a greater susceptibility to damage when compared to areas of track sections on the foundation ground.

The key issue is that higher-order models could better match the data, but they may not generalize\nto other datasets. Otherwise, a low-order model is unlikely to capture the underlying physical system response. Several authors have noted the difficulty of defining a unique order for ARX models. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is reported to be one of the most effective optimization techniques . Based on the exchange between fit accuracy and the number of estimated parameters, AIC measures the goodness-of-fit of an estimatedparameters, respectively, and ε is the average sum-of-square residual ( SSR ) errors. To find out an optimum order, one should examine a wide range of orders and choose the orderStudies conducted by Li et al. showed good results in gearbox fault detection.\nCWT produces a two-dimensional set of coefficients from the analyzed signal. Although the Fourier transforms typically use sine waves as the basis for decomposition, other functionscan be selected for the wavelet shape due to signal properties. Two parameters define wavelet analysis: scale and translation. The CWT ( T ) of the signal x ( t ) is determined aswhere a and b are the scale and translation parameters, and ψ [∗] is the complex conjugate of the mother wavelet T that involves a continuous function in both time and frequency domains.\nAfter the implementation of a CWT on the evaluated signals, a PCA is performed\nfollowed by the extraction of four statistical parameters, resulting in significant data compression . Based on the p -by- q matrix X containing the extracted CWT features from the original signal evaluated by each sensor, where p is the measurement points number and q is the wavelets coefficients number, the principal components can be determinedwhere Ss represents the scores matrix, and T is a q -by- q orthonormal linear transformation matrix. In addition, four statistical parameters are extracted from the scores, Ss, including the root mean square (RMS), standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. Thus, a matrix p -by- q is transformed into a k -by- q matrix, where k equals 4. Consequently, a total of k × qenvironmental and operational variations (EOVs). For example, in damage detection, itare mostly sensitive to damage . Therefore, implementing a latent variable method,\nnamely the PCA, may efficiently reduce EOVs influences, without requiring the direct measurement of those effects.

In this research study, n -components are\ndiscarded when the cumulative percentage of variance reaches 80% . Once n\nhas been selected, Equation (4) can be used to calculate the f-n components of matrix S. The transformation matrix T [ˆ] is constructed by the remaining f-n columns of matrix T . Using\nthe following function, the f-n components can be remapped to the main space:where, FPCA is m -by- f matrix of PCA features which is less sensitive to EOVs. Every sensorindex definition, is easy to implement and fast to process . For each simulation, the MD is considered to calculate a damage index (DI). Several damage identification studies haveDI . The MD is a well-known distance metric because it measures the distance\nbetween two points in a feature space containing two or more variables . Furthermore,\nit considers correlations between variables and does not depend on the scale of the features.\nIt can merge features from multiple sensors by performing data fusion. Mahalanobis\ndistance (namely here as DI ) is calculated by the following function:in which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−] , and is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The covariance matrix and mean vector intend to incorporate the baseline simulation. Based on the data derived from the\ndamaged system, a new observation would be far from the average of normal conditions.\nMahalanobis distances are calculated for each sensor and simulation. A matrix containing m Mahalanobis distances for i sensors is obtained from the above calculations.To automatically monitor train wheel conditions, the methodology performs outlier analysis. In Meixedo et al. and Mosleh et al. , this tool proved to be very efficient in\nclassifying the data as being related to a scenario with or without damage. Mahalanobisspace. A Gaussian distribution can be used to approximate the Mahalanobis distance, and statistical thresholds can be used to analyze outliers. By considering a mean value and standard deviation σ of the baseline feature vector, as well as the significance level α, itconsequently, when DI is equal to or higher than CB, a feature is considered to be an outlier.In the present research, the Laagrss freight train composed of five wagons is studied.\nAccording to the UIC classification, it can reach a top speed of 120 km/h . Each wagon has a tare weight of 27 t and can carry loads up to 52 t. A double freight wagon is shown incomponent. A rigid beam element was also used to connect the above-mentioned components. The numerical model of the vehicle is presented in Figure 3 and the mechanicaland geometric properties of the vehicle are detailed in Table 1. More details regarding the\nnumerical model of the freight wagons are provided by Bragança et al. .program, developed by Montenegro et al. . The model is based on a multi-layer scheme,\nsimulating the ballast, sleepers, and rails, as shown in Figure 4. The railpads, resting on the sleepers under the rail, are simulated as spring elements connecting the sleepers and\nrail. The mass of the ballast is represented by elements of discrete mass points, while the\nrails and sleepers are modeled using beam elements, adopting the appropriate material properties for each one. Finally, spring-dashpot elements are also incorporated to consider\nfoundation flexibility. Table 2 presents the properties of the track model.ties are very small, their effects on wheel-rail contact cannot be neglected . Therefore,In real conditions, the wheels are not entirely smooth and have imperfections. Despite\ntheir small size, these out-of-roundness irregularities can cause extreme variations in the wheelrail contact forces, producing vibrations on the train and track components. A periodic radial\ntread irregularity around the wheel circumference characterizes the wheel polygonization.\nAccording to Peng , for wheel polygonization, the irregularity amplitudes should be higher than 0. mm. Inherent to polygonization, some parameters can geometrically characterize the phenomenon, such as the varying wavelengths (λ) in the function of the harmonic order (θ)Two groups of polygonal wheel profiles are generated for the numerical simulations,\none for undamaged scenarios and another for damaged scenarios, based on real wheel measurements, the irregularity amplitude spectra of which are presented in Figure 6.**Figure 6.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) ( **a** ) initial polygonalFor the first group of profiles, the measurement data obtained by Johansson et al.\nfor new wheels with wavelengths comprising 20 harmonics were used . Thebetween 0.135–2. m, being the upper limit of the perimeter of the wheel. For the second group of profiles, the measurement values for four wheels with polygonal damage obtained\nby Cai et al. were considered . The wheel pr i s are characterized by the\nwavelengths in the first 30 harmonics, with the 6th to 8th harmonic orders being dominant.\nThen, different irregularity wheel profiles are generated based on the sum of sine### w ( xw ) = ∑ Aθ sin [ψ] [θ]where Aθ is the amplitude of the sine function for each wavelength, which is calculated bywhere, as wre f = 1 µm. The wheel irregularity level ( Lw ) values are selected based on the\nirregularity spectrums of Figure 6, for both cases: initial polygonization or polygonal damage . Considering phase angles ( ψθ ) to the sine functions that are uniformly and randomly distributed between 0 and 2π, several wheel irregularities are In the case of polygonal damage, simulating different amplitudes are applied atobtain two different damage severities in the function of amplitude ranges, one between\n0. mm and 0. mm (a1) and the other between 0. mm and 1. mm (a2).

By observing these two figures, the difference inaround 0. mm and a damaged polygonal wheel with amplitudes between 0. mm and**Figure 7.** Example of an initial polygonization profile based on Figure 6a irregularity spectrum.**Figure 8.** Examples of polygonization-damaged profiles based on Figure 6b irregularity spectrumusing the in-house software VSI—Vehicle-Structure Interaction Analysis, which was validated and described in detail in the authors’ previous publication and was used in various of applications . In this model, the train is coupled to the track using a 3D wheel-rail contact model, using Hertzian theory to calculate the normal contact forces andsoftware. It is important to note that both subsystems are initially separately modeled in\nmodels via a fully coupled approach . The full explanation of the properties of\ntrack and train, including more details regarding train-track interaction, can be found in the authors’ previous publications . A graphical representation of the numerical model is shown in Figure 9. Note that the first wheel of the first wagon on the right side isA series of accelerometers are mounted along the track to detect a polygonized wheel.\nAccording to the results demonstrated in Mosleh et al. , the location of the most promising sensors for obtaining good results is on the rail. However, the possibility of placing the sensors on the sleepers was also analyzed, since their installation is much easier. Using a virtual wayside monitoring system, acceleration measurements were\nevaluated from 16 positions, as shown in Figure 10. In this figure, the numbers 1-to-4 andsleepers on the right and left sides, respectively, while the accelerations over the sleepers are measured by sensors located on positions 9-to-12 and 13-to-16.

Once validated,Based on several speeds, loading schemes, and unevenness profiles of the rail, Table 3\nsummarizes the simulations of the undamaged and damaged scenarios. Baseline scenariosconsider vehicle speeds between 40 and 120 km/h, and four unevenness profiles are considered for rail irregularities . A total of six types of loading schemes are\nconsidered: (i) a fully loaded train, (ii) a half-loaded train, (iii) an empty train, and trains with an unbalanced load in the transversal and longitudinal directions, namely (iv) UNB1,\n(v) UNB2, and (vi) UNB3. In accordance with UIC loading guidelines , differentgravity is longitudinally and transversally offset. For baseline scenarios, 113 simulationswheels with initial polygonal profiles. Therefore, in addition to 113 analyses with healthy wheels, 30 scenarios are considered with three semi-imperfection cases, including: (i) the right wheel on the front wheelset of the first wagon, (ii) the left wheel of the rear wheelset of the third wagon; (iii) the right wheel of the rear wheelset of the fifth wagon. Furthermore,the front wheel on the right side of the first wagon as a polygonized wheel. These scenarioslow-pass Chebyshev type II digital filter.

The wheel with a semi-imperfection profile is located on the first wheel of the first wagon. This figure illustrates the similarity between the measured accelerations\nin each case due to the similar amplitude of healthy and semi-imperfection wheels.\nAcceleration time series at position 1 for damaged wheels are presented in Figure 11b,\nconsidering two different amplitudes of wheel irregularity profiles. By comparing the results from Figure 11a,b, it is evident that the acceleration variation for the healthy wheel\nis between − 1. to 2. m/s , while the defective one changes between − 70 to 100 m/s .**Figure 11.** Acceleration time-series on position 1 for ( **a** ) healthy wheel and wheel with semiimperfection profile, ( **b** ) damaged wheel.As the first step in the automatic damage detection method, damage-sensitive features are extracted from dynamic responses. As mentioned in Section 2.1, the ARX and CWT\nmodels are implemented and their performances as feature extractors are compared.\nTo establish a suitable ARX model order, AIC values are ascendingly ranked from\n1 to 70. An average AIC function is presented in Figure 12 based on 113 baseline analyses.\nIt is evident from this figure that after model order 40, the AIC values tend to stabilize,\nshowing that higher orders do not provide additional information. Therefore, the ARX models’ input and output orders are set to 40, and a total of 80 features are extracted. The\nsensor installed at position 5 ( yj in Equation (1)) is used as output, while each of the otherof the features extracted by the ARX models is higher than the CWT method.

In Figure 13b,c, a comparison of baseline and damaged scenarios shows similar variations in amplitude. In Figure 13d, the amplitude variation between healthy\nand damaged scenarios is evident, as the amplitude does not change much for the first\n143 passages, and then increases, which may indicate a wheel defect. Overall, the presenceregardless of the technique applied. Thus, the feature normalization step is implemented**Figure 13.** Feature extraction for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–feature 3, ( **b** ) ARX–feature 36, ( **c** ) CWT–featureout to obtain indicators that are more sensitive to damage and less sensitive to EOVs. The Latent Variable Method PCA is applied for data normalization. As explained in Section 5.1,\nfor all 173 train passages, 3-dimensional CWT-double-PCA-based feature matrices of\n173 × 468 are calculated for each sensor. At the same time, the ARX model is implementedsensor. Note that the PCA matrices have the same dimensions as the feature extraction step In Figure 14, the same four features shown in Figure 13 for sensor 1 are shown after\nimplementing PCA for all undamaged and damaged scenarios. During the modeling process, components with a cumulative percentage of variances higher than 80% are discarded. Therefore, the number of discarded rows is seventeen and two for CWT-doublePCA-based and ARX-PCA-based methods, respectively. The results obtained are quite\ndifferent depending on the method applied as a feature extractor. A reduction in theobserved in Figure 14a,b. However, CWT-double-PCA-based parameters in Figure 14c,d,\nshow a more effective normalization of the baseline features. Overall, both methods reduce**Figure 14.** Feature normalization for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based feature 3, ( **b** ) ARX–PCA–based\nfeature 36, ( **c** ) CWT–double–PCA-based feature 140, ( **d** ) CWT–double–PCA–based feature 266.To merge all the data obtained from the ARX and CWT methods, the Mahalanobis distance is implemented by applying a two-stage fusion process: in the first step, the\nfeatures from each sensor are merged and, in the second stage, the multi-sensor information is fused to enhance the sensibility to the damage. Therefore, in the first stage, Mahalanobis\ndistance transfers 468 CWT-double-PCA-based parameters into one column (173 × 1) for each sensor and train passage. At the same time, 80 ARX-PCA-based parameters are\nconverted to a single damage-sensitive feature (173 × 1). Figure 15 demonstrates theARX-PCA and CWT-double-PCA considering sensor 1. It is possible to observe that this process significantly improves damage detection sensitivity for both approaches.**Figure 15.** Features fusion for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based, ( **b** ) CWT–double–PCA–based.Afterwards, in the second stage, all sensor information is merged to improve the sensitivity to the damage even more.

Therefore, it is possible to conclude that using ARX models as feature extractors**Figure 17.** Automatic wheel defect detection ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based ( **b** ) CWT–double–PCA–based.To reduce the time of installation and maintenance costs, it is necessary to obtain an\noptimal number of sensors, as well as a suitable location to install them without compromising the quality of the detection. As a result, a parametric study is carried out using\naccelerometers at distinct locations. In this analysis, only CWT is used for feature extraction because, as shown in Figure 17b, it is the best technique (with no false positives) compared(as presented in Figure 10) in terms of the total number (two, four, and six) are analyzed and the effectiveness of the detection methodology is demonstrated in Figure 18. The results concluded that even with two sensors (one on each side of the rail), the proposed**Figure 18.** Automatic polygonized wheel detection based on CWT technique considering: ( **a** ) sixIn the previous section, the proposed approach to detect a defective wheel from a healthy one was implemented for accelerometers located on the rail.

The validation of the proposed AI-based methodology herein, considering a polygonal wheel, is a clear step forward\nin terms of the proposed methodology’s effectiveness, allowing for a complete implementation**2.

By using the Mahalanobis distance, the features from each sensor can be effectively merged in the first stage. Moreover, a new Mahalanobis distance is applied\nagain in the second stage to integrate all sensor information. The outcome of this stepDI identifies a healthy or a defective wheel; a statistical confidence boundary (CB) isIn this study, the features are extracted based on autoregressive models with exogenous inputs (ARX) and continuous wavelet transform (CWT) models.

The ARX autoregressive model considers the predictive behavior of the system at a specific location, considering its history at the same\npoint and the predictive response at other measurement locations, being defined by the### xj = ∑ aixj−i +### ∑ bkyj−k + ε j (1)where xj, yj, and ε j are the output, input, as well as error term of the model at the signal value j . Moreover, ai, bk, ma, and mb are the parameters and the orders of the output and Initially, it is difficult to determine the most appropriate ARX model order. The key issue is that higher-order models could better match the data, but they may not generalize\nto other datasets. Otherwise, a low-order model is unlikely to capture the underlying physical system response. Several authors have noted the difficulty of defining a unique order for ARX models. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is reported to be one of the most effective optimization techniques . Based on the exchange between fit accuracy and the number of estimated parameters, AIC measures the goodness-of-fit of an estimatedparameters, respectively, and ε is the average sum-of-square residual ( SSR ) errors. To find out an optimum order, one should examine a wide range of orders and choose the orderStudies conducted by Li et al. showed good results in gearbox fault detection.\nCWT produces a two-dimensional set of coefficients from the analyzed signal. Although the Fourier transforms typically use sine waves as the basis for decomposition, other functionscan be selected for the wavelet shape due to signal properties. Two parameters define wavelet analysis: scale and translation. The CWT ( T ) of the signal x ( t ) is determined aswhere a and b are the scale and translation parameters, and ψ [∗] is the complex conjugate of the mother wavelet T that involves a continuous function in both time and frequency domains.\nAfter the implementation of a CWT on the evaluated signals, a PCA is performed\nfollowed by the extraction of four statistical parameters, resulting in significant data compression . Based on the p -by- q matrix X containing the extracted CWT features from the original signal evaluated by each sensor, where p is the measurement points number and q is the wavelets coefficients number, the principal components can be determinedwhere Ss represents the scores matrix, and T is a q -by- q orthonormal linear transformation matrix. In addition, four statistical parameters are extracted from the scores, Ss, including the root mean square (RMS), standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. Thus, a matrix p -by- q is transformed into a k -by- q matrix, where k equals 4. Consequently, a total of k × qenvironmental and operational variations (EOVs). For example, in damage detection, itare mostly sensitive to damage . Therefore, implementing a latent variable method,\nnamely the PCA, may efficiently reduce EOVs influences, without requiring the direct measurement of those effects. According to Bro and Smilde , PCA is a powerful and versatile method capable of providing an overview of complex multivariate data. PCA can be used to find and quantify patterns, generate new hypotheses, detect outliers, or find\nBy considering a m -by- f matrix X, taking into account features extracted from the dynamic responses, where m represents the train passages and f represents the number of\nfeatures extracted from sensors (i.e., k × q ), a transformation to another set of f features, Ss,\nis obtained by considering Equation (4). Considering the baseline condition, the covariance matrix ( C ) of the features is related to the covariance matrix of the scores Λ, as follows:where, Λ and T are matrices calculated by the singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix C . The columns of T are the eigenvectors and the diagonal matrix Λ, including\nthe eigenvalues of the matrix C in descending order. Thus, the eigenvalues stored in Λ areIt is possible to divide matrix Λ into two matrices with the first n eigenvalues and the remaining f-n eigenvalues. Determining the number of n -components is one of the\nchallenges in multivariate data interpretation. In this research study, n -components are\ndiscarded when the cumulative percentage of variance reaches 80% . Once n\nhas been selected, Equation (4) can be used to calculate the f-n components of matrix S. The transformation matrix T [ˆ] is constructed by the remaining f-n columns of matrix T . Using\nthe following function, the f-n components can be remapped to the main space:where, FPCA is m -by- f matrix of PCA features which is less sensitive to EOVs. Every sensorindex definition, is easy to implement and fast to process . For each simulation, the MD is considered to calculate a damage index (DI). Several damage identification studies haveDI . The MD is a well-known distance metric because it measures the distance\nbetween two points in a feature space containing two or more variables . Furthermore,\nit considers correlations between variables and does not depend on the scale of the features.\nIt can merge features from multiple sensors by performing data fusion. Mahalanobis\ndistance (namely here as DI ) is calculated by the following function:in which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−] , and is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The covariance matrix and mean vector intend to incorporate the baseline simulation. Based on the data derived from the\ndamaged system, a new observation would be far from the average of normal conditions.\nMahalanobis distances are calculated for each sensor and simulation. A matrix containing m Mahalanobis distances for i sensors is obtained from the above calculations.To automatically monitor train wheel conditions, the methodology performs outlier analysis. In Meixedo et al. and Mosleh et al. , this tool proved to be very efficient in\nclassifying the data as being related to a scenario with or without damage. Mahalanobisspace. A Gaussian distribution can be used to approximate the Mahalanobis distance, and statistical thresholds can be used to analyze outliers. By considering a mean value and standard deviation σ of the baseline feature vector, as well as the significance level α, itconsequently, when DI is equal to or higher than CB, a feature is considered to be an outlier.In the present research, the Laagrss freight train composed of five wagons is studied.\nAccording to the UIC classification, it can reach a top speed of 120 km/h .

Table 2 presents the properties of the track model.ties are very small, their effects on wheel-rail contact cannot be neglected . Therefore,In real conditions, the wheels are not entirely smooth and have imperfections. Despite\ntheir small size, these out-of-roundness irregularities can cause extreme variations in the wheelrail contact forces, producing vibrations on the train and track components. A periodic radial\ntread irregularity around the wheel circumference characterizes the wheel polygonization.\nAccording to Peng , for wheel polygonization, the irregularity amplitudes should be higher than 0. mm. Inherent to polygonization, some parameters can geometrically characterize the phenomenon, such as the varying wavelengths (λ) in the function of the harmonic order (θ)Two groups of polygonal wheel profiles are generated for the numerical simulations,\none for undamaged scenarios and another for damaged scenarios, based on real wheel measurements, the irregularity amplitude spectra of which are presented in Figure 6.**Figure 6.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) ( **a** ) initial polygonalFor the first group of profiles, the measurement data obtained by Johansson et al.\nfor new wheels with wavelengths comprising 20 harmonics were used .

The wheel pr i s are characterized by the\nwavelengths in the first 30 harmonics, with the 6th to 8th harmonic orders being dominant.\nThen, different irregularity wheel profiles are generated based on the sum of sine### w ( xw ) = ∑ Aθ sin [ψ] [θ]where Aθ is the amplitude of the sine function for each wavelength, which is calculated bywhere, as wre f = 1 µm. The wheel irregularity level ( Lw ) values are selected based on the\nirregularity spectrums of Figure 6, for both cases: initial polygonization or polygonal damage .

A graphical representation of the numerical model is shown in Figure 9. Note that the first wheel of the first wagon on the right side isA series of accelerometers are mounted along the track to detect a polygonized wheel.\nAccording to the results demonstrated in Mosleh et al. , the location of the most promising sensors for obtaining good results is on the rail. However, the possibility of placing the sensors on the sleepers was also analyzed, since their installation is much easier. Using a virtual wayside monitoring system, acceleration measurements were\nevaluated from 16 positions, as shown in Figure 10.

Once validated,Based on several speeds, loading schemes, and unevenness profiles of the rail, Table 3\nsummarizes the simulations of the undamaged and damaged scenarios. Baseline scenariosconsider vehicle speeds between 40 and 120 km/h, and four unevenness profiles are considered for rail irregularities . A total of six types of loading schemes are\nconsidered: (i) a fully loaded train, (ii) a half-loaded train, (iii) an empty train, and trains with an unbalanced load in the transversal and longitudinal directions, namely (iv) UNB1,\n(v) UNB2, and (vi) UNB3. In accordance with UIC loading guidelines , differentgravity is longitudinally and transversally offset. For baseline scenarios, 113 simulationswheels with initial polygonal profiles. Therefore, in addition to 113 analyses with healthy wheels, 30 scenarios are considered with three semi-imperfection cases, including: (i) the right wheel on the front wheelset of the first wagon, (ii) the left wheel of the rear wheelset of the third wagon; (iii) the right wheel of the rear wheelset of the fifth wagon.

By comparing the results from Figure 11a,b, it is evident that the acceleration variation for the healthy wheel\nis between − 1. to 2. m/s , while the defective one changes between − 70 to 100 m/s .**Figure 11.** Acceleration time-series on position 1 for ( **a** ) healthy wheel and wheel with semiimperfection profile, ( **b** ) damaged wheel.As the first step in the automatic damage detection method, damage-sensitive features are extracted from dynamic responses. As mentioned in Section 2.1, the ARX and CWT\nmodels are implemented and their performances as feature extractors are compared.\nTo establish a suitable ARX model order, AIC values are ascendingly ranked from\n1 to 70. An average AIC function is presented in Figure 12 based on 113 baseline analyses.\nIt is evident from this figure that after model order 40, the AIC values tend to stabilize,\nshowing that higher orders do not provide additional information. Therefore, the ARX models’ input and output orders are set to 40, and a total of 80 features are extracted. The\nsensor installed at position 5 ( yj in Equation (1)) is used as output, while each of the otherof the features extracted by the ARX models is higher than the CWT method.

Overall, the presenceregardless of the technique applied. Thus, the feature normalization step is implemented**Figure 13.** Feature extraction for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–feature 3, ( **b** ) ARX–feature 36, ( **c** ) CWT–featureout to obtain indicators that are more sensitive to damage and less sensitive to EOVs. The Latent Variable Method PCA is applied for data normalization.

Note that the PCA matrices have the same dimensions as the feature extraction step In Figure 14, the same four features shown in Figure 13 for sensor 1 are shown after\nimplementing PCA for all undamaged and damaged scenarios. During the modeling process, components with a cumulative percentage of variances higher than 80% are discarded. Therefore, the number of discarded rows is seventeen and two for CWT-doublePCA-based and ARX-PCA-based methods, respectively. The results obtained are quite\ndifferent depending on the method applied as a feature extractor. A reduction in theobserved in Figure 14a,b.

Therefore, in the first stage, Mahalanobis\ndistance transfers 468 CWT-double-PCA-based parameters into one column (173 × 1) for each sensor and train passage. At the same time, 80 ARX-PCA-based parameters are\nconverted to a single damage-sensitive feature (173 × 1). Figure 15 demonstrates theARX-PCA and CWT-double-PCA considering sensor 1. It is possible to observe that this process significantly improves damage detection sensitivity for both approaches.**Figure 15.** Features fusion for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based, ( **b** ) CWT–double–PCA–based.Afterwards, in the second stage, all sensor information is merged to improve the sensitivity to the damage even more.

Further, in the study by Peng , the mechanisms of\nOOR formation on wheels were presented considering different wear prediction models.\nConsidering recent technological advances, it is now possible to develop and implement automatic methodologies for detecting and identifying damage in different systems [15–17] for railway applications. With the application of these intelligent techniques, it\nis not intended to completely replace the visual inspections already used for many decades,\nbut rather, the creation of a compatible procedure. Traditional visual inspection and control techniques are expensive, occur at intervals, and are prone to errors, it is important to\nmotivate the widespread use of Structural Integrity Monitoring (SIE) systems, especially in\nrecent infrastructures or in systems of high value to society, as in the case of railway systems . Thus, it is essential to develop automatic methodologies for detecting different Despite the widespread research on railway defect detection, to the knowledge of the authors, the reported literature on automatic wheel polygonization identification has been limited so far. Therefore, taking advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies, it isan early stage. The detection of polygonized wheels is largely carried out using accelerometers mounted on the vehicle. The parametric power spectral estimation and adaptive chirpresults, but with flaws in polygonization detection in the early stages [19–21].\nOn the other hand, previous studies have shown very good results using waysidelearning in detecting defects in railway vehicle wheels, namely wheel flat detections .\nThis type of methodology usually presents the following steps: (i) feature extractionusing data from accelerations or strains measured on the track, (ii) feature modelingand operational variations, (iii) data fusion to merge different features and/or sensors information, and (iv) features discrimination to classify the defects. The studies carriedidentifying singular irregularities on the wheel surface (i.e., wheel flat). In this context, itcomprehensive number of damages, namely the ones that may occur along the entire Several methods have been used for feature extraction, which converts time-series\ndata into more condensed information, allowing damage to be more easily observed.\nSymbolic data, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) [15–17], principal component analysis\n(PCA) , and autoregressive models [15–17] are examples of effective techniques for\nextracting damage-sensitive features for both static and dynamic monitoring. In timedomain applications where the measured quantity is acceleration, autoregressive modelson the system response, with the model parameters reflecting the properties of the system regardless of the sources of excitations. CWT and PCA have been developed over decades in different applications, in both time and frequency domains with various sensors. Despite this, they present some limitations, PCA does not consider the non-linearity of the data\nand CWT adds excess redundancy to the data, and it has a high computational cost, so For feature fusion, several algorithms, including neighborhood-preserving embedding\n(NPE) , neural networks , Mahalanobis distance , manifold learning methods , and kernel-based methods , have been recently employed. This data fusioninformation. Due to its simplicity and ability to reduce multivariate data, Mahalanobis\nRecent approaches based on machine learning have been applied for feature classification to differentiate a healthy wheel from a defective one . Typically, two different approaches are used: (i) unsupervised methods, in which models are trained using labeled data under the supervision of training data, such as k-means , self-organizing maps\n(SOM) , and cluster analysis; or (ii) supervised methods, in which models are not supervised using training datasets, such as Naive Bayes classifiers and k-Nearest Neighbor\nThis work aims: (i) to develop an unsupervised methodology to identify polygonized\nwheels; (ii) to evaluate the performance of different feature extraction techniques concerning their sensitivity to the detection of wheel polygonization, specifically those based on\nautoregressive exogenous models (ARX) and continuous wavelet transforms (CWT); (iii) towheel defect detection system. The unsupervised methodology to identify polygonized wheels consists of five phases: (i) data acquisition, (ii) feature extraction, (iii) feature The acquired track responses are influenced by parameters such as speed, irregularities, and load types. In this sense, different simulations of realistic scenarios of dynamicconditions. On the other hand, to overcome some unpredictable oscillations in the measured responses and consequent failures in damage detection, some options can be taken.\nIn more complex structures, such as bridges and viaducts, there should be a greater susceptibility to damage when compared to areas of track sections on the foundation ground. If the structures are damaged, they may camouflage or cause false warnings. In a practical context, the use of sensors in an area of the track less prone to damage and where vibrationmethodology. Aligned on these assumptions, the location of the sensors was chosen on aAfter defining the AI approach for identifying wheel polygonization, two distinguished feature extraction methods, namely ARX and CWT, are compared. To avoid\nfalse alarm situations caused by environmental and operational effects, the latent variable method Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied. To reduce the volume of extracted data while retaining the most relevant information, as well as improve the ability to characterize the measured phenomenon, the data are merged using the Mahalanobis distance. As\na final step, an outlier analysis is employed to automatically distinguish a healthy wheel It should be highlighted that wheel flat identification was developed by Mosleh et al. ,\nwho demonstrated that the methodology is able to identify wheel flats. The validation of the proposed AI-based methodology herein, considering a polygonal wheel, is a clear step forward\nin terms of the proposed methodology’s effectiveness, allowing for a complete implementation**2. Proposed Methodology for Automatic Wheel Polygonization Detection**(ii) Feature extraction from multiple sensor signals, by continuous wavelet transforms\n(CWT) or autoregressive exogenous (ARX) models, that are separately implemented,\nand their performances are compared; in this step, a time record is transformed intonot only normalizes the extracted features but also increases their sensitivity to damage.sensitivity. By using the Mahalanobis distance, the features from each sensor can be effectively merged in the first stage. Moreover, a new Mahalanobis distance is applied\nagain in the second stage to integrate all sensor information. The outcome of this stepDI identifies a healthy or a defective wheel; a statistical confidence boundary (CB) isIn this study, the features are extracted based on autoregressive models with exogenous inputs (ARX) and continuous wavelet transform (CWT) models. The performance ofthe occurrence of gearbox failures. The ARX autoregressive model considers the predictive behavior of the system at a specific location, considering its history at the same\npoint and the predictive response at other measurement locations, being defined by the### xj = ∑ aixj−i +### ∑ bkyj−k + ε j (1)where xj, yj, and ε j are the output, input, as well as error term of the model at the signal value j . Moreover, ai, bk, ma, and mb are the parameters and the orders of the output and Initially, it is difficult to determine the most appropriate ARX model order. The key issue is that higher-order models could better match the data, but they may not generalize\nto other datasets. Otherwise, a low-order model is unlikely to capture the underlying physical system response. Several authors have noted the difficulty of defining a unique order for ARX models. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is reported to be one of the most effective optimization techniques . Based on the exchange between fit accuracy and the number of estimated parameters, AIC measures the goodness-of-fit of an estimatedparameters, respectively, and ε is the average sum-of-square residual ( SSR ) errors. To find out an optimum order, one should examine a wide range of orders and choose the orderStudies conducted by Li et al. showed good results in gearbox fault detection.\nCWT produces a two-dimensional set of coefficients from the analyzed signal. Although the Fourier transforms typically use sine waves as the basis for decomposition, other functionscan be selected for the wavelet shape due to signal properties. Two parameters define wavelet analysis: scale and translation. The CWT ( T ) of the signal x ( t ) is determined aswhere a and b are the scale and translation parameters, and ψ [∗] is the complex conjugate of the mother wavelet T that involves a continuous function in both time and frequency domains.\nAfter the implementation of a CWT on the evaluated signals, a PCA is performed\nfollowed by the extraction of four statistical parameters, resulting in significant data compression . Based on the p -by- q matrix X containing the extracted CWT features from the original signal evaluated by each sensor, where p is the measurement points number and q is the wavelets coefficients number, the principal components can be determinedwhere Ss represents the scores matrix, and T is a q -by- q orthonormal linear transformation matrix. In addition, four statistical parameters are extracted from the scores, Ss, including the root mean square (RMS), standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. Thus, a matrix p -by- q is transformed into a k -by- q matrix, where k equals 4. Consequently, a total of k × qenvironmental and operational variations (EOVs). For example, in damage detection, itare mostly sensitive to damage . Therefore, implementing a latent variable method,\nnamely the PCA, may efficiently reduce EOVs influences, without requiring the direct measurement of those effects. According to Bro and Smilde , PCA is a powerful and versatile method capable of providing an overview of complex multivariate data. PCA can be used to find and quantify patterns, generate new hypotheses, detect outliers, or find\nBy considering a m -by- f matrix X, taking into account features extracted from the dynamic responses, where m represents the train passages and f represents the number of\nfeatures extracted from sensors (i.e., k × q ), a transformation to another set of f features, Ss,\nis obtained by considering Equation (4). Considering the baseline condition, the covariance matrix ( C ) of the features is related to the covariance matrix of the scores Λ, as follows:where, Λ and T are matrices calculated by the singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix C . The columns of T are the eigenvectors and the diagonal matrix Λ, including\nthe eigenvalues of the matrix C in descending order. Thus, the eigenvalues stored in Λ areIt is possible to divide matrix Λ into two matrices with the first n eigenvalues and the remaining f-n eigenvalues. Determining the number of n -components is one of the\nchallenges in multivariate data interpretation. In this research study, n -components are\ndiscarded when the cumulative percentage of variance reaches 80% . Once n\nhas been selected, Equation (4) can be used to calculate the f-n components of matrix S. The transformation matrix T [ˆ] is constructed by the remaining f-n columns of matrix T . Using\nthe following function, the f-n components can be remapped to the main space:where, FPCA is m -by- f matrix of PCA features which is less sensitive to EOVs. Every sensorindex definition, is easy to implement and fast to process . For each simulation, the MD is considered to calculate a damage index (DI). Several damage identification studies haveDI . The MD is a well-known distance metric because it measures the distance\nbetween two points in a feature space containing two or more variables . Furthermore,\nit considers correlations between variables and does not depend on the scale of the features.\nIt can merge features from multiple sensors by performing data fusion. Mahalanobis\ndistance (namely here as DI ) is calculated by the following function:in which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−] , and is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The covariance matrix and mean vector intend to incorporate the baseline simulation. Based on the data derived from the\ndamaged system, a new observation would be far from the average of normal conditions.\nMahalanobis distances are calculated for each sensor and simulation. A matrix containing m Mahalanobis distances for i sensors is obtained from the above calculations.To automatically monitor train wheel conditions, the methodology performs outlier analysis. In Meixedo et al. and Mosleh et al. , this tool proved to be very efficient in\nclassifying the data as being related to a scenario with or without damage. Mahalanobisspace. A Gaussian distribution can be used to approximate the Mahalanobis distance, and statistical thresholds can be used to analyze outliers. By considering a mean value and standard deviation σ of the baseline feature vector, as well as the significance level α, itconsequently, when DI is equal to or higher than CB, a feature is considered to be an outlier.In the present research, the Laagrss freight train composed of five wagons is studied.\nAccording to the UIC classification, it can reach a top speed of 120 km/h . Each wagon has a tare weight of 27 t and can carry loads up to 52 t. A double freight wagon is shown incomponent. A rigid beam element was also used to connect the above-mentioned components. The numerical model of the vehicle is presented in Figure 3 and the mechanicaland geometric properties of the vehicle are detailed in Table 1. More details regarding the\nnumerical model of the freight wagons are provided by Bragança et al. .program, developed by Montenegro et al. . The model is based on a multi-layer scheme,\nsimulating the ballast, sleepers, and rails, as shown in Figure 4. The railpads, resting on the sleepers under the rail, are simulated as spring elements connecting the sleepers and\nrail. The mass of the ballast is represented by elements of discrete mass points, while the\nrails and sleepers are modeled using beam elements, adopting the appropriate material properties for each one. Finally, spring-dashpot elements are also incorporated to consider\nfoundation flexibility. Table 2 presents the properties of the track model.ties are very small, their effects on wheel-rail contact cannot be neglected . Therefore,In real conditions, the wheels are not entirely smooth and have imperfections. Despite\ntheir small size, these out-of-roundness irregularities can cause extreme variations in the wheelrail contact forces, producing vibrations on the train and track components. A periodic radial\ntread irregularity around the wheel circumference characterizes the wheel polygonization.\nAccording to Peng , for wheel polygonization, the irregularity amplitudes should be higher than 0. mm. Inherent to polygonization, some parameters can geometrically characterize the phenomenon, such as the varying wavelengths (λ) in the function of the harmonic order (θ)Two groups of polygonal wheel profiles are generated for the numerical simulations,\none for undamaged scenarios and another for damaged scenarios, based on real wheel measurements, the irregularity amplitude spectra of which are presented in Figure 6.**Figure 6.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) ( **a** ) initial polygonalFor the first group of profiles, the measurement data obtained by Johansson et al.\nfor new wheels with wavelengths comprising 20 harmonics were used . Thebetween 0.135–2. m, being the upper limit of the perimeter of the wheel. For the second group of profiles, the measurement values for four wheels with polygonal damage obtained\nby Cai et al. were considered . The wheel pr i s are characterized by the\nwavelengths in the first 30 harmonics, with the 6th to 8th harmonic orders being dominant.\nThen, different irregularity wheel profiles are generated based on the sum of sine### w ( xw ) = ∑ Aθ sin [ψ] [θ]where Aθ is the amplitude of the sine function for each wavelength, which is calculated bywhere, as wre f = 1 µm. The wheel irregularity level ( Lw ) values are selected based on the\nirregularity spectrums of Figure 6, for both cases: initial polygonization or polygonal damage . Considering phase angles ( ψθ ) to the sine functions that are uniformly and randomly distributed between 0 and 2π, several wheel irregularities are In the case of polygonal damage, simulating different amplitudes are applied atobtain two different damage severities in the function of amplitude ranges, one between\n0. mm and 0. mm (a1) and the other between 0. mm and 1. mm (a2).

A graphical representation of the numerical model is shown in Figure 9. Note that the first wheel of the first wagon on the right side isA series of accelerometers are mounted along the track to detect a polygonized wheel.\nAccording to the results demonstrated in Mosleh et al. , the location of the most promising sensors for obtaining good results is on the rail. However, the possibility of placing the sensors on the sleepers was also analyzed, since their installation is much easier. Using a virtual wayside monitoring system, acceleration measurements were\nevaluated from 16 positions, as shown in Figure 10. In this figure, the numbers 1-to-4 andsleepers on the right and left sides, respectively, while the accelerations over the sleepers are measured by sensors located on positions 9-to-12 and 13-to-16. A virtual simulationautomatic wheel polygonized detection approach presented in this study. Once validated,Based on several speeds, loading schemes, and unevenness profiles of the rail, Table 3\nsummarizes the simulations of the undamaged and damaged scenarios. Baseline scenariosconsider vehicle speeds between 40 and 120 km/h, and four unevenness profiles are considered for rail irregularities . A total of six types of loading schemes are\nconsidered: (i) a fully loaded train, (ii) a half-loaded train, (iii) an empty train, and trains with an unbalanced load in the transversal and longitudinal directions, namely (iv) UNB1,\n(v) UNB2, and (vi) UNB3. In accordance with UIC loading guidelines , differentgravity is longitudinally and transversally offset. For baseline scenarios, 113 simulationswheels with initial polygonal profiles. Therefore, in addition to 113 analyses with healthy wheels, 30 scenarios are considered with three semi-imperfection cases, including: (i) the right wheel on the front wheelset of the first wagon, (ii) the left wheel of the rear wheelset of the third wagon; (iii) the right wheel of the rear wheelset of the fifth wagon.

This figure illustrates the similarity between the measured accelerations\nin each case due to the similar amplitude of healthy and semi-imperfection wheels.\nAcceleration time series at position 1 for damaged wheels are presented in Figure 11b,\nconsidering two different amplitudes of wheel irregularity profiles. By comparing the results from Figure 11a,b, it is evident that the acceleration variation for the healthy wheel\nis between − 1. to 2. m/s , while the defective one changes between − 70 to 100 m/s .**Figure 11.** Acceleration time-series on position 1 for ( **a** ) healthy wheel and wheel with semiimperfection profile, ( **b** ) damaged wheel.As the first step in the automatic damage detection method, damage-sensitive features are extracted from dynamic responses. As mentioned in Section 2.1, the ARX and CWT\nmodels are implemented and their performances as feature extractors are compared.\nTo establish a suitable ARX model order, AIC values are ascendingly ranked from\n1 to 70. An average AIC function is presented in Figure 12 based on 113 baseline analyses.\nIt is evident from this figure that after model order 40, the AIC values tend to stabilize,\nshowing that higher orders do not provide additional information. Therefore, the ARX models’ input and output orders are set to 40, and a total of 80 features are extracted. The\nsensor installed at position 5 ( yj in Equation (1)) is used as output, while each of the otherof the features extracted by the ARX models is higher than the CWT method.

In Figure 13b,c, a comparison of baseline and damaged scenarios shows similar variations in amplitude.

Overall, the presenceregardless of the technique applied. Thus, the feature normalization step is implemented**Figure 13.** Feature extraction for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–feature 3, ( **b** ) ARX–feature 36, ( **c** ) CWT–featureout to obtain indicators that are more sensitive to damage and less sensitive to EOVs. The Latent Variable Method PCA is applied for data normalization. As explained in Section 5.1,\nfor all 173 train passages, 3-dimensional CWT-double-PCA-based feature matrices of\n173 × 468 are calculated for each sensor. At the same time, the ARX model is implementedsensor. Note that the PCA matrices have the same dimensions as the feature extraction step In Figure 14, the same four features shown in Figure 13 for sensor 1 are shown after\nimplementing PCA for all undamaged and damaged scenarios. During the modeling process, components with a cumulative percentage of variances higher than 80% are discarded. Therefore, the number of discarded rows is seventeen and two for CWT-doublePCA-based and ARX-PCA-based methods, respectively. The results obtained are quite\ndifferent depending on the method applied as a feature extractor. A reduction in theobserved in Figure 14a,b. However, CWT-double-PCA-based parameters in Figure 14c,d,\nshow a more effective normalization of the baseline features. Overall, both methods reduce**Figure 14.** Feature normalization for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based feature 3, ( **b** ) ARX–PCA–based\nfeature 36, ( **c** ) CWT–double–PCA-based feature 140, ( **d** ) CWT–double–PCA–based feature 266.To merge all the data obtained from the ARX and CWT methods, the Mahalanobis distance is implemented by applying a two-stage fusion process: in the first step, the\nfeatures from each sensor are merged and, in the second stage, the multi-sensor information is fused to enhance the sensibility to the damage. Therefore, in the first stage, Mahalanobis\ndistance transfers 468 CWT-double-PCA-based parameters into one column (173 × 1) for each sensor and train passage. At the same time, 80 ARX-PCA-based parameters are\nconverted to a single damage-sensitive feature (173 × 1). Figure 15 demonstrates theARX-PCA and CWT-double-PCA considering sensor 1. It is possible to observe that this process significantly improves damage detection sensitivity for both approaches.**Figure 15.** Features fusion for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based, ( **b** ) CWT–double–PCA–based.Afterwards, in the second stage, all sensor information is merged to improve the sensitivity to the damage even more.

Therefore, it is possible to conclude that using ARX models as feature extractors**Figure 17.** Automatic wheel defect detection ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based ( **b** ) CWT–double–PCA–based.To reduce the time of installation and maintenance costs, it is necessary to obtain an\noptimal number of sensors, as well as a suitable location to install them without compromising the quality of the detection. As a result, a parametric study is carried out using\naccelerometers at distinct locations. In this analysis, only CWT is used for feature extraction because, as shown in Figure 17b, it is the best technique (with no false positives) compared(as presented in Figure 10) in terms of the total number (two, four, and six) are analyzed and the effectiveness of the detection methodology is demonstrated in Figure 18. The results concluded that even with two sensors (one on each side of the rail), the proposed**Figure 18.** Automatic polygonized wheel detection based on CWT technique considering: ( **a** ) sixIn the previous section, the proposed approach to detect a defective wheel from a healthy one was implemented for accelerometers located on the rail.

With the application of these intelligent techniques, it\nis not intended to completely replace the visual inspections already used for many decades,\nbut rather, the creation of a compatible procedure.

Thus, it is essential to develop automatic methodologies for detecting different Despite the widespread research on railway defect detection, to the knowledge of the authors, the reported literature on automatic wheel polygonization identification has been limited so far. Therefore, taking advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies, it isan early stage. The detection of polygonized wheels is largely carried out using accelerometers mounted on the vehicle. The parametric power spectral estimation and adaptive chirpresults, but with flaws in polygonization detection in the early stages [19–21].\nOn the other hand, previous studies have shown very good results using waysidelearning in detecting defects in railway vehicle wheels, namely wheel flat detections .\nThis type of methodology usually presents the following steps: (i) feature extractionusing data from accelerations or strains measured on the track, (ii) feature modelingand operational variations, (iii) data fusion to merge different features and/or sensors information, and (iv) features discrimination to classify the defects. The studies carriedidentifying singular irregularities on the wheel surface (i.e., wheel flat). In this context, itcomprehensive number of damages, namely the ones that may occur along the entire Several methods have been used for feature extraction, which converts time-series\ndata into more condensed information, allowing damage to be more easily observed.\nSymbolic data, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) [15–17], principal component analysis\n(PCA) , and autoregressive models [15–17] are examples of effective techniques for\nextracting damage-sensitive features for both static and dynamic monitoring.

CWT and PCA have been developed over decades in different applications, in both time and frequency domains with various sensors.

Typically, two different approaches are used: (i) unsupervised methods, in which models are trained using labeled data under the supervision of training data, such as k-means , self-organizing maps\n(SOM) , and cluster analysis; or (ii) supervised methods, in which models are not supervised using training datasets, such as Naive Bayes classifiers and k-Nearest Neighbor\nThis work aims: (i) to develop an unsupervised methodology to identify polygonized\nwheels; (ii) to evaluate the performance of different feature extraction techniques concerning their sensitivity to the detection of wheel polygonization, specifically those based on\nautoregressive exogenous models (ARX) and continuous wavelet transforms (CWT); (iii) towheel defect detection system. The unsupervised methodology to identify polygonized wheels consists of five phases: (i) data acquisition, (ii) feature extraction, (iii) feature The acquired track responses are influenced by parameters such as speed, irregularities, and load types. In this sense, different simulations of realistic scenarios of dynamicconditions. On the other hand, to overcome some unpredictable oscillations in the measured responses and consequent failures in damage detection, some options can be taken.\nIn more complex structures, such as bridges and viaducts, there should be a greater susceptibility to damage when compared to areas of track sections on the foundation ground. If the structures are damaged, they may camouflage or cause false warnings. In a practical context, the use of sensors in an area of the track less prone to damage and where vibrationmethodology.

Moreover, ai, bk, ma, and mb are the parameters and the orders of the output and Initially, it is difficult to determine the most appropriate ARX model order. The key issue is that higher-order models could better match the data, but they may not generalize\nto other datasets. Otherwise, a low-order model is unlikely to capture the underlying physical system response. Several authors have noted the difficulty of defining a unique order for ARX models. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is reported to be one of the most effective optimization techniques . Based on the exchange between fit accuracy and the number of estimated parameters, AIC measures the goodness-of-fit of an estimatedparameters, respectively, and ε is the average sum-of-square residual ( SSR ) errors. To find out an optimum order, one should examine a wide range of orders and choose the orderStudies conducted by Li et al. showed good results in gearbox fault detection.\nCWT produces a two-dimensional set of coefficients from the analyzed signal. Although the Fourier transforms typically use sine waves as the basis for decomposition, other functionscan be selected for the wavelet shape due to signal properties. Two parameters define wavelet analysis: scale and translation. The CWT ( T ) of the signal x ( t ) is determined aswhere a and b are the scale and translation parameters, and ψ [∗] is the complex conjugate of the mother wavelet T that involves a continuous function in both time and frequency domains.\nAfter the implementation of a CWT on the evaluated signals, a PCA is performed\nfollowed by the extraction of four statistical parameters, resulting in significant data compression . Based on the p -by- q matrix X containing the extracted CWT features from the original signal evaluated by each sensor, where p is the measurement points number and q is the wavelets coefficients number, the principal components can be determinedwhere Ss represents the scores matrix, and T is a q -by- q orthonormal linear transformation matrix. In addition, four statistical parameters are extracted from the scores, Ss, including the root mean square (RMS), standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. Thus, a matrix p -by- q is transformed into a k -by- q matrix, where k equals 4. Consequently, a total of k × qenvironmental and operational variations (EOVs). For example, in damage detection, itare mostly sensitive to damage . Therefore, implementing a latent variable method,\nnamely the PCA, may efficiently reduce EOVs influences, without requiring the direct measurement of those effects.

Considering the baseline condition, the covariance matrix ( C ) of the features is related to the covariance matrix of the scores Λ, as follows:where, Λ and T are matrices calculated by the singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix C . The columns of T are the eigenvectors and the diagonal matrix Λ, including\nthe eigenvalues of the matrix C in descending order. Thus, the eigenvalues stored in Λ areIt is possible to divide matrix Λ into two matrices with the first n eigenvalues and the remaining f-n eigenvalues. Determining the number of n -components is one of the\nchallenges in multivariate data interpretation. In this research study, n -components are\ndiscarded when the cumulative percentage of variance reaches 80% . Once n\nhas been selected, Equation (4) can be used to calculate the f-n components of matrix S. The transformation matrix T [ˆ] is constructed by the remaining f-n columns of matrix T . Using\nthe following function, the f-n components can be remapped to the main space:where, FPCA is m -by- f matrix of PCA features which is less sensitive to EOVs. Every sensorindex definition, is easy to implement and fast to process . For each simulation, the MD is considered to calculate a damage index (DI). Several damage identification studies haveDI . The MD is a well-known distance metric because it measures the distance\nbetween two points in a feature space containing two or more variables . Furthermore,\nit considers correlations between variables and does not depend on the scale of the features.\nIt can merge features from multiple sensors by performing data fusion. Mahalanobis\ndistance (namely here as DI ) is calculated by the following function:in which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−] , and is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The covariance matrix and mean vector intend to incorporate the baseline simulation. Based on the data derived from the\ndamaged system, a new observation would be far from the average of normal conditions.\nMahalanobis distances are calculated for each sensor and simulation. A matrix containing m Mahalanobis distances for i sensors is obtained from the above calculations.To automatically monitor train wheel conditions, the methodology performs outlier analysis.

Therefore,In real conditions, the wheels are not entirely smooth and have imperfections. Despite\ntheir small size, these out-of-roundness irregularities can cause extreme variations in the wheelrail contact forces, producing vibrations on the train and track components. A periodic radial\ntread irregularity around the wheel circumference characterizes the wheel polygonization.\nAccording to Peng , for wheel polygonization, the irregularity amplitudes should be higher than 0. mm. Inherent to polygonization, some parameters can geometrically characterize the phenomenon, such as the varying wavelengths (λ) in the function of the harmonic order (θ)Two groups of polygonal wheel profiles are generated for the numerical simulations,\none for undamaged scenarios and another for damaged scenarios, based on real wheel measurements, the irregularity amplitude spectra of which are presented in Figure 6.**Figure 6.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) ( **a** ) initial polygonalFor the first group of profiles, the measurement data obtained by Johansson et al.\nfor new wheels with wavelengths comprising 20 harmonics were used .

By comparing the results from Figure 11a,b, it is evident that the acceleration variation for the healthy wheel\nis between − 1. to 2. m/s , while the defective one changes between − 70 to 100 m/s .**Figure 11.** Acceleration time-series on position 1 for ( **a** ) healthy wheel and wheel with semiimperfection profile, ( **b** ) damaged wheel.As the first step in the automatic damage detection method, damage-sensitive features are extracted from dynamic responses. As mentioned in Section 2.1, the ARX and CWT\nmodels are implemented and their performances as feature extractors are compared.\nTo establish a suitable ARX model order, AIC values are ascendingly ranked from\n1 to 70. An average AIC function is presented in Figure 12 based on 113 baseline analyses.\nIt is evident from this figure that after model order 40, the AIC values tend to stabilize,\nshowing that higher orders do not provide additional information. Therefore, the ARX models’ input and output orders are set to 40, and a total of 80 features are extracted.

In summary, despite the high precision for monitoring defective wheels, these on-board systems require a high installation cost to\nIn a wayside monitoring system, the wheel-rail contact interface plays a significant role.\nAt this point, the dynamic forces of wheel-rail interaction are established, which allows the acquisition of relevant information about various factors inherent to the traffic conditions .\nAlthough these components represent a high maintenance cost, serious accidents with high economic losses and possible human injuries can be avoided. Regarding railway safety, wheel defects are one of the main causes of accidents , causing interruptionsreliability. Furthermore, these defects promote negative effects on both the vehicle and\nFurthermore, wheels deteriorate over time due to wear and fatigue, which may develop various defects such as polygonization, flats and shelling, altering the wheel-rail contact characteristics and, consequently, causing greater impact forces .

Further, in the study by Peng , the mechanisms of\nOOR formation on wheels were presented considering different wear prediction models.\nConsidering recent technological advances, it is now possible to develop and implement automatic methodologies for detecting and identifying damage in different systems [15–17] for railway applications. With the application of these intelligent techniques, it\nis not intended to completely replace the visual inspections already used for many decades,\nbut rather, the creation of a compatible procedure. Traditional visual inspection and control techniques are expensive, occur at intervals, and are prone to errors, it is important to\nmotivate the widespread use of Structural Integrity Monitoring (SIE) systems, especially in\nrecent infrastructures or in systems of high value to society, as in the case of railway systems . Thus, it is essential to develop automatic methodologies for detecting different Despite the widespread research on railway defect detection, to the knowledge of the authors, the reported literature on automatic wheel polygonization identification has been limited so far. Therefore, taking advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies, it isan early stage. The detection of polygonized wheels is largely carried out using accelerometers mounted on the vehicle. The parametric power spectral estimation and adaptive chirpresults, but with flaws in polygonization detection in the early stages [19–21].\nOn the other hand, previous studies have shown very good results using waysidelearning in detecting defects in railway vehicle wheels, namely wheel flat detections .\nThis type of methodology usually presents the following steps: (i) feature extractionusing data from accelerations or strains measured on the track, (ii) feature modelingand operational variations, (iii) data fusion to merge different features and/or sensors information, and (iv) features discrimination to classify the defects. The studies carriedidentifying singular irregularities on the wheel surface (i.e., wheel flat). In this context, itcomprehensive number of damages, namely the ones that may occur along the entire Several methods have been used for feature extraction, which converts time-series\ndata into more condensed information, allowing damage to be more easily observed.\nSymbolic data, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) [15–17], principal component analysis\n(PCA) , and autoregressive models [15–17] are examples of effective techniques for\nextracting damage-sensitive features for both static and dynamic monitoring.

CWT and PCA have been developed over decades in different applications, in both time and frequency domains with various sensors.

Due to its simplicity and ability to reduce multivariate data, Mahalanobis\nRecent approaches based on machine learning have been applied for feature classification to differentiate a healthy wheel from a defective one . Typically, two different approaches are used: (i) unsupervised methods, in which models are trained using labeled data under the supervision of training data, such as k-means , self-organizing maps\n(SOM) , and cluster analysis; or (ii) supervised methods, in which models are not supervised using training datasets, such as Naive Bayes classifiers and k-Nearest Neighbor\nThis work aims: (i) to develop an unsupervised methodology to identify polygonized\nwheels; (ii) to evaluate the performance of different feature extraction techniques concerning their sensitivity to the detection of wheel polygonization, specifically those based on\nautoregressive exogenous models (ARX) and continuous wavelet transforms (CWT); (iii) towheel defect detection system. The unsupervised methodology to identify polygonized wheels consists of five phases: (i) data acquisition, (ii) feature extraction, (iii) feature The acquired track responses are influenced by parameters such as speed, irregularities, and load types. In this sense, different simulations of realistic scenarios of dynamicconditions. On the other hand, to overcome some unpredictable oscillations in the measured responses and consequent failures in damage detection, some options can be taken.\nIn more complex structures, such as bridges and viaducts, there should be a greater susceptibility to damage when compared to areas of track sections on the foundation ground. If the structures are damaged, they may camouflage or cause false warnings. In a practical context, the use of sensors in an area of the track less prone to damage and where vibrationmethodology. Aligned on these assumptions, the location of the sensors was chosen on aAfter defining the AI approach for identifying wheel polygonization, two distinguished feature extraction methods, namely ARX and CWT, are compared. To avoid\nfalse alarm situations caused by environmental and operational effects, the latent variable method Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied.

Moreover, ai, bk, ma, and mb are the parameters and the orders of the output and Initially, it is difficult to determine the most appropriate ARX model order. The key issue is that higher-order models could better match the data, but they may not generalize\nto other datasets. Otherwise, a low-order model is unlikely to capture the underlying physical system response. Several authors have noted the difficulty of defining a unique order for ARX models. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is reported to be one of the most effective optimization techniques . Based on the exchange between fit accuracy and the number of estimated parameters, AIC measures the goodness-of-fit of an estimatedparameters, respectively, and ε is the average sum-of-square residual ( SSR ) errors. To find out an optimum order, one should examine a wide range of orders and choose the orderStudies conducted by Li et al. showed good results in gearbox fault detection.\nCWT produces a two-dimensional set of coefficients from the analyzed signal. Although the Fourier transforms typically use sine waves as the basis for decomposition, other functionscan be selected for the wavelet shape due to signal properties. Two parameters define wavelet analysis: scale and translation. The CWT ( T ) of the signal x ( t ) is determined aswhere a and b are the scale and translation parameters, and ψ [∗] is the complex conjugate of the mother wavelet T that involves a continuous function in both time and frequency domains.\nAfter the implementation of a CWT on the evaluated signals, a PCA is performed\nfollowed by the extraction of four statistical parameters, resulting in significant data compression . Based on the p -by- q matrix X containing the extracted CWT features from the original signal evaluated by each sensor, where p is the measurement points number and q is the wavelets coefficients number, the principal components can be determinedwhere Ss represents the scores matrix, and T is a q -by- q orthonormal linear transformation matrix. In addition, four statistical parameters are extracted from the scores, Ss, including the root mean square (RMS), standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. Thus, a matrix p -by- q is transformed into a k -by- q matrix, where k equals 4. Consequently, a total of k × qenvironmental and operational variations (EOVs). For example, in damage detection, itare mostly sensitive to damage . Therefore, implementing a latent variable method,\nnamely the PCA, may efficiently reduce EOVs influences, without requiring the direct measurement of those effects. According to Bro and Smilde , PCA is a powerful and versatile method capable of providing an overview of complex multivariate data. PCA can be used to find and quantify patterns, generate new hypotheses, detect outliers, or find\nBy considering a m -by- f matrix X, taking into account features extracted from the dynamic responses, where m represents the train passages and f represents the number of\nfeatures extracted from sensors (i.e., k × q ), a transformation to another set of f features, Ss,\nis obtained by considering Equation (4). Considering the baseline condition, the covariance matrix ( C ) of the features is related to the covariance matrix of the scores Λ, as follows:where, Λ and T are matrices calculated by the singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix C . The columns of T are the eigenvectors and the diagonal matrix Λ, including\nthe eigenvalues of the matrix C in descending order. Thus, the eigenvalues stored in Λ areIt is possible to divide matrix Λ into two matrices with the first n eigenvalues and the remaining f-n eigenvalues.

Once n\nhas been selected, Equation (4) can be used to calculate the f-n components of matrix S. The transformation matrix T [ˆ] is constructed by the remaining f-n columns of matrix T . Using\nthe following function, the f-n components can be remapped to the main space:where, FPCA is m -by- f matrix of PCA features which is less sensitive to EOVs. Every sensorindex definition, is easy to implement and fast to process . For each simulation, the MD is considered to calculate a damage index (DI). Several damage identification studies haveDI . The MD is a well-known distance metric because it measures the distance\nbetween two points in a feature space containing two or more variables . Furthermore,\nit considers correlations between variables and does not depend on the scale of the features.\nIt can merge features from multiple sensors by performing data fusion. Mahalanobis\ndistance (namely here as DI ) is calculated by the following function:in which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−] , and is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The covariance matrix and mean vector intend to incorporate the baseline simulation. Based on the data derived from the\ndamaged system, a new observation would be far from the average of normal conditions.\nMahalanobis distances are calculated for each sensor and simulation. A matrix containing m Mahalanobis distances for i sensors is obtained from the above calculations.To automatically monitor train wheel conditions, the methodology performs outlier analysis.

Therefore,In real conditions, the wheels are not entirely smooth and have imperfections. Despite\ntheir small size, these out-of-roundness irregularities can cause extreme variations in the wheelrail contact forces, producing vibrations on the train and track components. A periodic radial\ntread irregularity around the wheel circumference characterizes the wheel polygonization.\nAccording to Peng , for wheel polygonization, the irregularity amplitudes should be higher than 0. mm. Inherent to polygonization, some parameters can geometrically characterize the phenomenon, such as the varying wavelengths (λ) in the function of the harmonic order (θ)Two groups of polygonal wheel profiles are generated for the numerical simulations,\none for undamaged scenarios and another for damaged scenarios, based on real wheel measurements, the irregularity amplitude spectra of which are presented in Figure 6.**Figure 6.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) ( **a** ) initial polygonalFor the first group of profiles, the measurement data obtained by Johansson et al.\nfor new wheels with wavelengths comprising 20 harmonics were used .

Once validated,Based on several speeds, loading schemes, and unevenness profiles of the rail, Table 3\nsummarizes the simulations of the undamaged and damaged scenarios. Baseline scenariosconsider vehicle speeds between 40 and 120 km/h, and four unevenness profiles are considered for rail irregularities .

Therefore, in addition to 113 analyses with healthy wheels, 30 scenarios are considered with three semi-imperfection cases, including: (i) the right wheel on the front wheelset of the first wagon, (ii) the left wheel of the rear wheelset of the third wagon; (iii) the right wheel of the rear wheelset of the fifth wagon.

By comparing the results from Figure 11a,b, it is evident that the acceleration variation for the healthy wheel\nis between − 1. to 2. m/s , while the defective one changes between − 70 to 100 m/s .**Figure 11.** Acceleration time-series on position 1 for ( **a** ) healthy wheel and wheel with semiimperfection profile, ( **b** ) damaged wheel.As the first step in the automatic damage detection method, damage-sensitive features are extracted from dynamic responses. As mentioned in Section 2.1, the ARX and CWT\nmodels are implemented and their performances as feature extractors are compared.\nTo establish a suitable ARX model order, AIC values are ascendingly ranked from\n1 to 70. An average AIC function is presented in Figure 12 based on 113 baseline analyses.\nIt is evident from this figure that after model order 40, the AIC values tend to stabilize,\nshowing that higher orders do not provide additional information. Therefore, the ARX models’ input and output orders are set to 40, and a total of 80 features are extracted.

Therefore, in the first stage, Mahalanobis\ndistance transfers 468 CWT-double-PCA-based parameters into one column (173 × 1) for each sensor and train passage. At the same time, 80 ARX-PCA-based parameters are\nconverted to a single damage-sensitive feature (173 × 1). Figure 15 demonstrates theARX-PCA and CWT-double-PCA considering sensor 1.

Further, in the study by Peng , the mechanisms of\nOOR formation on wheels were presented considering different wear prediction models.\nConsidering recent technological advances, it is now possible to develop and implement automatic methodologies for detecting and identifying damage in different systems [15–17] for railway applications. With the application of these intelligent techniques, it\nis not intended to completely replace the visual inspections already used for many decades,\nbut rather, the creation of a compatible procedure. Traditional visual inspection and control techniques are expensive, occur at intervals, and are prone to errors, it is important to\nmotivate the widespread use of Structural Integrity Monitoring (SIE) systems, especially in\nrecent infrastructures or in systems of high value to society, as in the case of railway systems . Thus, it is essential to develop automatic methodologies for detecting different Despite the widespread research on railway defect detection, to the knowledge of the authors, the reported literature on automatic wheel polygonization identification has been limited so far. Therefore, taking advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies, it isan early stage. The detection of polygonized wheels is largely carried out using accelerometers mounted on the vehicle. The parametric power spectral estimation and adaptive chirpresults, but with flaws in polygonization detection in the early stages [19–21].\nOn the other hand, previous studies have shown very good results using waysidelearning in detecting defects in railway vehicle wheels, namely wheel flat detections .\nThis type of methodology usually presents the following steps: (i) feature extractionusing data from accelerations or strains measured on the track, (ii) feature modelingand operational variations, (iii) data fusion to merge different features and/or sensors information, and (iv) features discrimination to classify the defects. The studies carriedidentifying singular irregularities on the wheel surface (i.e., wheel flat). In this context, itcomprehensive number of damages, namely the ones that may occur along the entire Several methods have been used for feature extraction, which converts time-series\ndata into more condensed information, allowing damage to be more easily observed.\nSymbolic data, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) [15–17], principal component analysis\n(PCA) , and autoregressive models [15–17] are examples of effective techniques for\nextracting damage-sensitive features for both static and dynamic monitoring.

CWT and PCA have been developed over decades in different applications, in both time and frequency domains with various sensors.

Typically, two different approaches are used: (i) unsupervised methods, in which models are trained using labeled data under the supervision of training data, such as k-means , self-organizing maps\n(SOM) , and cluster analysis; or (ii) supervised methods, in which models are not supervised using training datasets, such as Naive Bayes classifiers and k-Nearest Neighbor\nThis work aims: (i) to develop an unsupervised methodology to identify polygonized\nwheels; (ii) to evaluate the performance of different feature extraction techniques concerning their sensitivity to the detection of wheel polygonization, specifically those based on\nautoregressive exogenous models (ARX) and continuous wavelet transforms (CWT); (iii) towheel defect detection system. The unsupervised methodology to identify polygonized wheels consists of five phases: (i) data acquisition, (ii) feature extraction, (iii) feature The acquired track responses are influenced by parameters such as speed, irregularities, and load types. In this sense, different simulations of realistic scenarios of dynamicconditions. On the other hand, to overcome some unpredictable oscillations in the measured responses and consequent failures in damage detection, some options can be taken.\nIn more complex structures, such as bridges and viaducts, there should be a greater susceptibility to damage when compared to areas of track sections on the foundation ground. If the structures are damaged, they may camouflage or cause false warnings. In a practical context, the use of sensors in an area of the track less prone to damage and where vibrationmethodology.

To avoid\nfalse alarm situations caused by environmental and operational effects, the latent variable method Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied. To reduce the volume of extracted data while retaining the most relevant information, as well as improve the ability to characterize the measured phenomenon, the data are merged using the Mahalanobis distance. As\na final step, an outlier analysis is employed to automatically distinguish a healthy wheel It should be highlighted that wheel flat identification was developed by Mosleh et al. ,\nwho demonstrated that the methodology is able to identify wheel flats.

Moreover, ai, bk, ma, and mb are the parameters and the orders of the output and Initially, it is difficult to determine the most appropriate ARX model order. The key issue is that higher-order models could better match the data, but they may not generalize\nto other datasets. Otherwise, a low-order model is unlikely to capture the underlying physical system response. Several authors have noted the difficulty of defining a unique order for ARX models. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is reported to be one of the most effective optimization techniques . Based on the exchange between fit accuracy and the number of estimated parameters, AIC measures the goodness-of-fit of an estimatedparameters, respectively, and ε is the average sum-of-square residual ( SSR ) errors. To find out an optimum order, one should examine a wide range of orders and choose the orderStudies conducted by Li et al. showed good results in gearbox fault detection.\nCWT produces a two-dimensional set of coefficients from the analyzed signal. Although the Fourier transforms typically use sine waves as the basis for decomposition, other functionscan be selected for the wavelet shape due to signal properties. Two parameters define wavelet analysis: scale and translation. The CWT ( T ) of the signal x ( t ) is determined aswhere a and b are the scale and translation parameters, and ψ [∗] is the complex conjugate of the mother wavelet T that involves a continuous function in both time and frequency domains.\nAfter the implementation of a CWT on the evaluated signals, a PCA is performed\nfollowed by the extraction of four statistical parameters, resulting in significant data compression . Based on the p -by- q matrix X containing the extracted CWT features from the original signal evaluated by each sensor, where p is the measurement points number and q is the wavelets coefficients number, the principal components can be determinedwhere Ss represents the scores matrix, and T is a q -by- q orthonormal linear transformation matrix. In addition, four statistical parameters are extracted from the scores, Ss, including the root mean square (RMS), standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. Thus, a matrix p -by- q is transformed into a k -by- q matrix, where k equals 4. Consequently, a total of k × qenvironmental and operational variations (EOVs). For example, in damage detection, itare mostly sensitive to damage . Therefore, implementing a latent variable method,\nnamely the PCA, may efficiently reduce EOVs influences, without requiring the direct measurement of those effects. According to Bro and Smilde , PCA is a powerful and versatile method capable of providing an overview of complex multivariate data. PCA can be used to find and quantify patterns, generate new hypotheses, detect outliers, or find\nBy considering a m -by- f matrix X, taking into account features extracted from the dynamic responses, where m represents the train passages and f represents the number of\nfeatures extracted from sensors (i.e., k × q ), a transformation to another set of f features, Ss,\nis obtained by considering Equation (4). Considering the baseline condition, the covariance matrix ( C ) of the features is related to the covariance matrix of the scores Λ, as follows:where, Λ and T are matrices calculated by the singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix C . The columns of T are the eigenvectors and the diagonal matrix Λ, including\nthe eigenvalues of the matrix C in descending order. Thus, the eigenvalues stored in Λ areIt is possible to divide matrix Λ into two matrices with the first n eigenvalues and the remaining f-n eigenvalues.

A periodic radial\ntread irregularity around the wheel circumference characterizes the wheel polygonization.\nAccording to Peng , for wheel polygonization, the irregularity amplitudes should be higher than 0. mm. Inherent to polygonization, some parameters can geometrically characterize the phenomenon, such as the varying wavelengths (λ) in the function of the harmonic order (θ)Two groups of polygonal wheel profiles are generated for the numerical simulations,\none for undamaged scenarios and another for damaged scenarios, based on real wheel measurements, the irregularity amplitude spectra of which are presented in Figure 6.**Figure 6.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) ( **a** ) initial polygonalFor the first group of profiles, the measurement data obtained by Johansson et al.\nfor new wheels with wavelengths comprising 20 harmonics were used .

As mentioned in Section 2.1, the ARX and CWT\nmodels are implemented and their performances as feature extractors are compared.\nTo establish a suitable ARX model order, AIC values are ascendingly ranked from\n1 to 70. An average AIC function is presented in Figure 12 based on 113 baseline analyses.\nIt is evident from this figure that after model order 40, the AIC values tend to stabilize,\nshowing that higher orders do not provide additional information. Therefore, the ARX models’ input and output orders are set to 40, and a total of 80 features are extracted. The\nsensor installed at position 5 ( yj in Equation (1)) is used as output, while each of the otherof the features extracted by the ARX models is higher than the CWT method.

In Figure 13b,c, a comparison of baseline and damaged scenarios shows similar variations in amplitude. In Figure 13d, the amplitude variation between healthy\nand damaged scenarios is evident, as the amplitude does not change much for the first\n143 passages, and then increases, which may indicate a wheel defect. Overall, the presenceregardless of the technique applied. Thus, the feature normalization step is implemented**Figure 13.** Feature extraction for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–feature 3, ( **b** ) ARX–feature 36, ( **c** ) CWT–featureout to obtain indicators that are more sensitive to damage and less sensitive to EOVs. The Latent Variable Method PCA is applied for data normalization. As explained in Section 5.1,\nfor all 173 train passages, 3-dimensional CWT-double-PCA-based feature matrices of\n173 × 468 are calculated for each sensor. At the same time, the ARX model is implementedsensor. Note that the PCA matrices have the same dimensions as the feature extraction step In Figure 14, the same four features shown in Figure 13 for sensor 1 are shown after\nimplementing PCA for all undamaged and damaged scenarios. During the modeling process, components with a cumulative percentage of variances higher than 80% are discarded. Therefore, the number of discarded rows is seventeen and two for CWT-doublePCA-based and ARX-PCA-based methods, respectively. The results obtained are quite\ndifferent depending on the method applied as a feature extractor. A reduction in theobserved in Figure 14a,b. However, CWT-double-PCA-based parameters in Figure 14c,d,\nshow a more effective normalization of the baseline features. Overall, both methods reduce**Figure 14.** Feature normalization for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based feature 3, ( **b** ) ARX–PCA–based\nfeature 36, ( **c** ) CWT–double–PCA-based feature 140, ( **d** ) CWT–double–PCA–based feature 266.To merge all the data obtained from the ARX and CWT methods, the Mahalanobis distance is implemented by applying a two-stage fusion process: in the first step, the\nfeatures from each sensor are merged and, in the second stage, the multi-sensor information is fused to enhance the sensibility to the damage. Therefore, in the first stage, Mahalanobis\ndistance transfers 468 CWT-double-PCA-based parameters into one column (173 × 1) for each sensor and train passage. At the same time, 80 ARX-PCA-based parameters are\nconverted to a single damage-sensitive feature (173 × 1). Figure 15 demonstrates theARX-PCA and CWT-double-PCA considering sensor 1. It is possible to observe that this process significantly improves damage detection sensitivity for both approaches.**Figure 15.** Features fusion for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based, ( **b** ) CWT–double–PCA–based.Afterwards, in the second stage, all sensor information is merged to improve the sensitivity to the damage even more.

With the application of these intelligent techniques, it\nis not intended to completely replace the visual inspections already used for many decades,\nbut rather, the creation of a compatible procedure. Traditional visual inspection and control techniques are expensive, occur at intervals, and are prone to errors, it is important to\nmotivate the widespread use of Structural Integrity Monitoring (SIE) systems, especially in\nrecent infrastructures or in systems of high value to society, as in the case of railway systems . Thus, it is essential to develop automatic methodologies for detecting different Despite the widespread research on railway defect detection, to the knowledge of the authors, the reported literature on automatic wheel polygonization identification has been limited so far. Therefore, taking advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies, it isan early stage. The detection of polygonized wheels is largely carried out using accelerometers mounted on the vehicle.

The studies carriedidentifying singular irregularities on the wheel surface (i.e., wheel flat). In this context, itcomprehensive number of damages, namely the ones that may occur along the entire Several methods have been used for feature extraction, which converts time-series\ndata into more condensed information, allowing damage to be more easily observed.\nSymbolic data, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) [15–17], principal component analysis\n(PCA) , and autoregressive models [15–17] are examples of effective techniques for\nextracting damage-sensitive features for both static and dynamic monitoring.

Typically, two different approaches are used: (i) unsupervised methods, in which models are trained using labeled data under the supervision of training data, such as k-means , self-organizing maps\n(SOM) , and cluster analysis; or (ii) supervised methods, in which models are not supervised using training datasets, such as Naive Bayes classifiers and k-Nearest Neighbor\nThis work aims: (i) to develop an unsupervised methodology to identify polygonized\nwheels; (ii) to evaluate the performance of different feature extraction techniques concerning their sensitivity to the detection of wheel polygonization, specifically those based on\nautoregressive exogenous models (ARX) and continuous wavelet transforms (CWT); (iii) towheel defect detection system.

On the other hand, to overcome some unpredictable oscillations in the measured responses and consequent failures in damage detection, some options can be taken.\nIn more complex structures, such as bridges and viaducts, there should be a greater susceptibility to damage when compared to areas of track sections on the foundation ground.

Moreover, ai, bk, ma, and mb are the parameters and the orders of the output and Initially, it is difficult to determine the most appropriate ARX model order. The key issue is that higher-order models could better match the data, but they may not generalize\nto other datasets. Otherwise, a low-order model is unlikely to capture the underlying physical system response. Several authors have noted the difficulty of defining a unique order for ARX models. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is reported to be one of the most effective optimization techniques . Based on the exchange between fit accuracy and the number of estimated parameters, AIC measures the goodness-of-fit of an estimatedparameters, respectively, and ε is the average sum-of-square residual ( SSR ) errors. To find out an optimum order, one should examine a wide range of orders and choose the orderStudies conducted by Li et al. showed good results in gearbox fault detection.\nCWT produces a two-dimensional set of coefficients from the analyzed signal. Although the Fourier transforms typically use sine waves as the basis for decomposition, other functionscan be selected for the wavelet shape due to signal properties. Two parameters define wavelet analysis: scale and translation. The CWT ( T ) of the signal x ( t ) is determined aswhere a and b are the scale and translation parameters, and ψ [∗] is the complex conjugate of the mother wavelet T that involves a continuous function in both time and frequency domains.\nAfter the implementation of a CWT on the evaluated signals, a PCA is performed\nfollowed by the extraction of four statistical parameters, resulting in significant data compression . Based on the p -by- q matrix X containing the extracted CWT features from the original signal evaluated by each sensor, where p is the measurement points number and q is the wavelets coefficients number, the principal components can be determinedwhere Ss represents the scores matrix, and T is a q -by- q orthonormal linear transformation matrix. In addition, four statistical parameters are extracted from the scores, Ss, including the root mean square (RMS), standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. Thus, a matrix p -by- q is transformed into a k -by- q matrix, where k equals 4. Consequently, a total of k × qenvironmental and operational variations (EOVs). For example, in damage detection, itare mostly sensitive to damage . Therefore, implementing a latent variable method,\nnamely the PCA, may efficiently reduce EOVs influences, without requiring the direct measurement of those effects. According to Bro and Smilde , PCA is a powerful and versatile method capable of providing an overview of complex multivariate data. PCA can be used to find and quantify patterns, generate new hypotheses, detect outliers, or find\nBy considering a m -by- f matrix X, taking into account features extracted from the dynamic responses, where m represents the train passages and f represents the number of\nfeatures extracted from sensors (i.e., k × q ), a transformation to another set of f features, Ss,\nis obtained by considering Equation (4). Considering the baseline condition, the covariance matrix ( C ) of the features is related to the covariance matrix of the scores Λ, as follows:where, Λ and T are matrices calculated by the singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix C . The columns of T are the eigenvectors and the diagonal matrix Λ, including\nthe eigenvalues of the matrix C in descending order. Thus, the eigenvalues stored in Λ areIt is possible to divide matrix Λ into two matrices with the first n eigenvalues and the remaining f-n eigenvalues. Determining the number of n -components is one of the\nchallenges in multivariate data interpretation. In this research study, n -components are\ndiscarded when the cumulative percentage of variance reaches 80% . Once n\nhas been selected, Equation (4) can be used to calculate the f-n components of matrix S. The transformation matrix T [ˆ] is constructed by the remaining f-n columns of matrix T . Using\nthe following function, the f-n components can be remapped to the main space:where, FPCA is m -by- f matrix of PCA features which is less sensitive to EOVs. Every sensorindex definition, is easy to implement and fast to process . For each simulation, the MD is considered to calculate a damage index (DI). Several damage identification studies haveDI . The MD is a well-known distance metric because it measures the distance\nbetween two points in a feature space containing two or more variables . Furthermore,\nit considers correlations between variables and does not depend on the scale of the features.\nIt can merge features from multiple sensors by performing data fusion. Mahalanobis\ndistance (namely here as DI ) is calculated by the following function:in which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−] , and is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation.

Table 2 presents the properties of the track model.ties are very small, their effects on wheel-rail contact cannot be neglected . Therefore,In real conditions, the wheels are not entirely smooth and have imperfections. Despite\ntheir small size, these out-of-roundness irregularities can cause extreme variations in the wheelrail contact forces, producing vibrations on the train and track components. A periodic radial\ntread irregularity around the wheel circumference characterizes the wheel polygonization.\nAccording to Peng , for wheel polygonization, the irregularity amplitudes should be higher than 0. mm. Inherent to polygonization, some parameters can geometrically characterize the phenomenon, such as the varying wavelengths (λ) in the function of the harmonic order (θ)Two groups of polygonal wheel profiles are generated for the numerical simulations,\none for undamaged scenarios and another for damaged scenarios, based on real wheel measurements, the irregularity amplitude spectra of which are presented in Figure 6.**Figure 6.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) ( **a** ) initial polygonalFor the first group of profiles, the measurement data obtained by Johansson et al.\nfor new wheels with wavelengths comprising 20 harmonics were used . Thebetween 0.135–2. m, being the upper limit of the perimeter of the wheel. For the second group of profiles, the measurement values for four wheels with polygonal damage obtained\nby Cai et al. were considered . The wheel pr i s are characterized by the\nwavelengths in the first 30 harmonics, with the 6th to 8th harmonic orders being dominant.\nThen, different irregularity wheel profiles are generated based on the sum of sine### w ( xw ) = ∑ Aθ sin [ψ] [θ]where Aθ is the amplitude of the sine function for each wavelength, which is calculated bywhere, as wre f = 1 µm. The wheel irregularity level ( Lw ) values are selected based on the\nirregularity spectrums of Figure 6, for both cases: initial polygonization or polygonal damage . Considering phase angles ( ψθ ) to the sine functions that are uniformly and randomly distributed between 0 and 2π, several wheel irregularities are In the case of polygonal damage, simulating different amplitudes are applied atobtain two different damage severities in the function of amplitude ranges, one between\n0. mm and 0. mm (a1) and the other between 0. mm and 1. mm (a2).

In this model, the train is coupled to the track using a 3D wheel-rail contact model, using Hertzian theory to calculate the normal contact forces andsoftware.

A graphical representation of the numerical model is shown in Figure 9. Note that the first wheel of the first wagon on the right side isA series of accelerometers are mounted along the track to detect a polygonized wheel.\nAccording to the results demonstrated in Mosleh et al. , the location of the most promising sensors for obtaining good results is on the rail. However, the possibility of placing the sensors on the sleepers was also analyzed, since their installation is much easier. Using a virtual wayside monitoring system, acceleration measurements were\nevaluated from 16 positions, as shown in Figure 10. In this figure, the numbers 1-to-4 andsleepers on the right and left sides, respectively, while the accelerations over the sleepers are measured by sensors located on positions 9-to-12 and 13-to-16.

Once validated,Based on several speeds, loading schemes, and unevenness profiles of the rail, Table 3\nsummarizes the simulations of the undamaged and damaged scenarios. Baseline scenariosconsider vehicle speeds between 40 and 120 km/h, and four unevenness profiles are considered for rail irregularities . A total of six types of loading schemes are\nconsidered: (i) a fully loaded train, (ii) a half-loaded train, (iii) an empty train, and trains with an unbalanced load in the transversal and longitudinal directions, namely (iv) UNB1,\n(v) UNB2, and (vi) UNB3. In accordance with UIC loading guidelines , differentgravity is longitudinally and transversally offset. For baseline scenarios, 113 simulationswheels with initial polygonal profiles. Therefore, in addition to 113 analyses with healthy wheels, 30 scenarios are considered with three semi-imperfection cases, including: (i) the right wheel on the front wheelset of the first wagon, (ii) the left wheel of the rear wheelset of the third wagon; (iii) the right wheel of the rear wheelset of the fifth wagon.

This figure illustrates the similarity between the measured accelerations\nin each case due to the similar amplitude of healthy and semi-imperfection wheels.\nAcceleration time series at position 1 for damaged wheels are presented in Figure 11b,\nconsidering two different amplitudes of wheel irregularity profiles. By comparing the results from Figure 11a,b, it is evident that the acceleration variation for the healthy wheel\nis between − 1. to 2. m/s , while the defective one changes between − 70 to 100 m/s .**Figure 11.** Acceleration time-series on position 1 for ( **a** ) healthy wheel and wheel with semiimperfection profile, ( **b** ) damaged wheel.As the first step in the automatic damage detection method, damage-sensitive features are extracted from dynamic responses. As mentioned in Section 2.1, the ARX and CWT\nmodels are implemented and their performances as feature extractors are compared.\nTo establish a suitable ARX model order, AIC values are ascendingly ranked from\n1 to 70. An average AIC function is presented in Figure 12 based on 113 baseline analyses.\nIt is evident from this figure that after model order 40, the AIC values tend to stabilize,\nshowing that higher orders do not provide additional information. Therefore, the ARX models’ input and output orders are set to 40, and a total of 80 features are extracted. The\nsensor installed at position 5 ( yj in Equation (1)) is used as output, while each of the otherof the features extracted by the ARX models is higher than the CWT method.

In Figure 13b,c, a comparison of baseline and damaged scenarios shows similar variations in amplitude. In Figure 13d, the amplitude variation between healthy\nand damaged scenarios is evident, as the amplitude does not change much for the first\n143 passages, and then increases, which may indicate a wheel defect. Overall, the presenceregardless of the technique applied. Thus, the feature normalization step is implemented**Figure 13.** Feature extraction for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–feature 3, ( **b** ) ARX–feature 36, ( **c** ) CWT–featureout to obtain indicators that are more sensitive to damage and less sensitive to EOVs. The Latent Variable Method PCA is applied for data normalization. As explained in Section 5.1,\nfor all 173 train passages, 3-dimensional CWT-double-PCA-based feature matrices of\n173 × 468 are calculated for each sensor. At the same time, the ARX model is implementedsensor. Note that the PCA matrices have the same dimensions as the feature extraction step In Figure 14, the same four features shown in Figure 13 for sensor 1 are shown after\nimplementing PCA for all undamaged and damaged scenarios. During the modeling process, components with a cumulative percentage of variances higher than 80% are discarded. Therefore, the number of discarded rows is seventeen and two for CWT-doublePCA-based and ARX-PCA-based methods, respectively. The results obtained are quite\ndifferent depending on the method applied as a feature extractor. A reduction in theobserved in Figure 14a,b. However, CWT-double-PCA-based parameters in Figure 14c,d,\nshow a more effective normalization of the baseline features.

Therefore, in the first stage, Mahalanobis\ndistance transfers 468 CWT-double-PCA-based parameters into one column (173 × 1) for each sensor and train passage. At the same time, 80 ARX-PCA-based parameters are\nconverted to a single damage-sensitive feature (173 × 1). Figure 15 demonstrates theARX-PCA and CWT-double-PCA considering sensor 1. It is possible to observe that this process significantly improves damage detection sensitivity for both approaches.**Figure 15.** Features fusion for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based, ( **b** ) CWT–double–PCA–based.Afterwards, in the second stage, all sensor information is merged to improve the sensitivity to the damage even more.

Therefore, it is possible to conclude that using ARX models as feature extractors**Figure 17.** Automatic wheel defect detection ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based ( **b** ) CWT–double–PCA–based.To reduce the time of installation and maintenance costs, it is necessary to obtain an\noptimal number of sensors, as well as a suitable location to install them without compromising the quality of the detection. As a result, a parametric study is carried out using\naccelerometers at distinct locations. In this analysis, only CWT is used for feature extraction because, as shown in Figure 17b, it is the best technique (with no false positives) compared(as presented in Figure 10) in terms of the total number (two, four, and six) are analyzed and the effectiveness of the detection methodology is demonstrated in Figure 18. The results concluded that even with two sensors (one on each side of the rail), the proposed**Figure 18.** Automatic polygonized wheel detection based on CWT technique considering: ( **a** ) sixIn the previous section, the proposed approach to detect a defective wheel from a healthy one was implemented for accelerometers located on the rail.

Thus, it is essential to develop automatic methodologies for detecting different Despite the widespread research on railway defect detection, to the knowledge of the authors, the reported literature on automatic wheel polygonization identification has been limited so far. Therefore, taking advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies, it isan early stage. The detection of polygonized wheels is largely carried out using accelerometers mounted on the vehicle.

Moreover, ai, bk, ma, and mb are the parameters and the orders of the output and Initially, it is difficult to determine the most appropriate ARX model order. The key issue is that higher-order models could better match the data, but they may not generalize\nto other datasets. Otherwise, a low-order model is unlikely to capture the underlying physical system response. Several authors have noted the difficulty of defining a unique order for ARX models. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is reported to be one of the most effective optimization techniques . Based on the exchange between fit accuracy and the number of estimated parameters, AIC measures the goodness-of-fit of an estimatedparameters, respectively, and ε is the average sum-of-square residual ( SSR ) errors. To find out an optimum order, one should examine a wide range of orders and choose the orderStudies conducted by Li et al. showed good results in gearbox fault detection.\nCWT produces a two-dimensional set of coefficients from the analyzed signal. Although the Fourier transforms typically use sine waves as the basis for decomposition, other functionscan be selected for the wavelet shape due to signal properties. Two parameters define wavelet analysis: scale and translation. The CWT ( T ) of the signal x ( t ) is determined aswhere a and b are the scale and translation parameters, and ψ [∗] is the complex conjugate of the mother wavelet T that involves a continuous function in both time and frequency domains.\nAfter the implementation of a CWT on the evaluated signals, a PCA is performed\nfollowed by the extraction of four statistical parameters, resulting in significant data compression . Based on the p -by- q matrix X containing the extracted CWT features from the original signal evaluated by each sensor, where p is the measurement points number and q is the wavelets coefficients number, the principal components can be determinedwhere Ss represents the scores matrix, and T is a q -by- q orthonormal linear transformation matrix. In addition, four statistical parameters are extracted from the scores, Ss, including the root mean square (RMS), standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. Thus, a matrix p -by- q is transformed into a k -by- q matrix, where k equals 4. Consequently, a total of k × qenvironmental and operational variations (EOVs).

Therefore, implementing a latent variable method,\nnamely the PCA, may efficiently reduce EOVs influences, without requiring the direct measurement of those effects. According to Bro and Smilde , PCA is a powerful and versatile method capable of providing an overview of complex multivariate data. PCA can be used to find and quantify patterns, generate new hypotheses, detect outliers, or find\nBy considering a m -by- f matrix X, taking into account features extracted from the dynamic responses, where m represents the train passages and f represents the number of\nfeatures extracted from sensors (i.e., k × q ), a transformation to another set of f features, Ss,\nis obtained by considering Equation (4). Considering the baseline condition, the covariance matrix ( C ) of the features is related to the covariance matrix of the scores Λ, as follows:where, Λ and T are matrices calculated by the singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix C . The columns of T are the eigenvectors and the diagonal matrix Λ, including\nthe eigenvalues of the matrix C in descending order. Thus, the eigenvalues stored in Λ areIt is possible to divide matrix Λ into two matrices with the first n eigenvalues and the remaining f-n eigenvalues. Determining the number of n -components is one of the\nchallenges in multivariate data interpretation. In this research study, n -components are\ndiscarded when the cumulative percentage of variance reaches 80% . Once n\nhas been selected, Equation (4) can be used to calculate the f-n components of matrix S. The transformation matrix T [ˆ] is constructed by the remaining f-n columns of matrix T . Using\nthe following function, the f-n components can be remapped to the main space:where, FPCA is m -by- f matrix of PCA features which is less sensitive to EOVs. Every sensorindex definition, is easy to implement and fast to process . For each simulation, the MD is considered to calculate a damage index (DI). Several damage identification studies haveDI . The MD is a well-known distance metric because it measures the distance\nbetween two points in a feature space containing two or more variables . Furthermore,\nit considers correlations between variables and does not depend on the scale of the features.\nIt can merge features from multiple sensors by performing data fusion. Mahalanobis\ndistance (namely here as DI ) is calculated by the following function:in which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−] , and is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The covariance matrix and mean vector intend to incorporate the baseline simulation. Based on the data derived from the\ndamaged system, a new observation would be far from the average of normal conditions.\nMahalanobis distances are calculated for each sensor and simulation. A matrix containing m Mahalanobis distances for i sensors is obtained from the above calculations.To automatically monitor train wheel conditions, the methodology performs outlier analysis. In Meixedo et al. and Mosleh et al. , this tool proved to be very efficient in\nclassifying the data as being related to a scenario with or without damage. Mahalanobisspace. A Gaussian distribution can be used to approximate the Mahalanobis distance, and statistical thresholds can be used to analyze outliers. By considering a mean value and standard deviation σ of the baseline feature vector, as well as the significance level α, itconsequently, when DI is equal to or higher than CB, a feature is considered to be an outlier.In the present research, the Laagrss freight train composed of five wagons is studied.\nAccording to the UIC classification, it can reach a top speed of 120 km/h . Each wagon has a tare weight of 27 t and can carry loads up to 52 t. A double freight wagon is shown incomponent. A rigid beam element was also used to connect the above-mentioned components.

The model is based on a multi-layer scheme,\nsimulating the ballast, sleepers, and rails, as shown in Figure 4. The railpads, resting on the sleepers under the rail, are simulated as spring elements connecting the sleepers and\nrail. The mass of the ballast is represented by elements of discrete mass points, while the\nrails and sleepers are modeled using beam elements, adopting the appropriate material properties for each one. Finally, spring-dashpot elements are also incorporated to consider\nfoundation flexibility. Table 2 presents the properties of the track model.ties are very small, their effects on wheel-rail contact cannot be neglected . Therefore,In real conditions, the wheels are not entirely smooth and have imperfections. Despite\ntheir small size, these out-of-roundness irregularities can cause extreme variations in the wheelrail contact forces, producing vibrations on the train and track components. A periodic radial\ntread irregularity around the wheel circumference characterizes the wheel polygonization.\nAccording to Peng , for wheel polygonization, the irregularity amplitudes should be higher than 0. mm. Inherent to polygonization, some parameters can geometrically characterize the phenomenon, such as the varying wavelengths (λ) in the function of the harmonic order (θ)Two groups of polygonal wheel profiles are generated for the numerical simulations,\none for undamaged scenarios and another for damaged scenarios, based on real wheel measurements, the irregularity amplitude spectra of which are presented in Figure 6.**Figure 6.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) ( **a** ) initial polygonalFor the first group of profiles, the measurement data obtained by Johansson et al.\nfor new wheels with wavelengths comprising 20 harmonics were used . Thebetween 0.135–2. m, being the upper limit of the perimeter of the wheel. For the second group of profiles, the measurement values for four wheels with polygonal damage obtained\nby Cai et al. were considered . The wheel pr i s are characterized by the\nwavelengths in the first 30 harmonics, with the 6th to 8th harmonic orders being dominant.\nThen, different irregularity wheel profiles are generated based on the sum of sine### w ( xw ) = ∑ Aθ sin [ψ] [θ]where Aθ is the amplitude of the sine function for each wavelength, which is calculated bywhere, as wre f = 1 µm. The wheel irregularity level ( Lw ) values are selected based on the\nirregularity spectrums of Figure 6, for both cases: initial polygonization or polygonal damage . Considering phase angles ( ψθ ) to the sine functions that are uniformly and randomly distributed between 0 and 2π, several wheel irregularities are In the case of polygonal damage, simulating different amplitudes are applied atobtain two different damage severities in the function of amplitude ranges, one between\n0. mm and 0. mm (a1) and the other between 0. mm and 1. mm (a2).

A graphical representation of the numerical model is shown in Figure 9. Note that the first wheel of the first wagon on the right side isA series of accelerometers are mounted along the track to detect a polygonized wheel.\nAccording to the results demonstrated in Mosleh et al. , the location of the most promising sensors for obtaining good results is on the rail. However, the possibility of placing the sensors on the sleepers was also analyzed, since their installation is much easier. Using a virtual wayside monitoring system, acceleration measurements were\nevaluated from 16 positions, as shown in Figure 10.

Once validated,Based on several speeds, loading schemes, and unevenness profiles of the rail, Table 3\nsummarizes the simulations of the undamaged and damaged scenarios. Baseline scenariosconsider vehicle speeds between 40 and 120 km/h, and four unevenness profiles are considered for rail irregularities . A total of six types of loading schemes are\nconsidered: (i) a fully loaded train, (ii) a half-loaded train, (iii) an empty train, and trains with an unbalanced load in the transversal and longitudinal directions, namely (iv) UNB1,\n(v) UNB2, and (vi) UNB3. In accordance with UIC loading guidelines , differentgravity is longitudinally and transversally offset. For baseline scenarios, 113 simulationswheels with initial polygonal profiles. Therefore, in addition to 113 analyses with healthy wheels, 30 scenarios are considered with three semi-imperfection cases, including: (i) the right wheel on the front wheelset of the first wagon, (ii) the left wheel of the rear wheelset of the third wagon; (iii) the right wheel of the rear wheelset of the fifth wagon.

This figure illustrates the similarity between the measured accelerations\nin each case due to the similar amplitude of healthy and semi-imperfection wheels.\nAcceleration time series at position 1 for damaged wheels are presented in Figure 11b,\nconsidering two different amplitudes of wheel irregularity profiles. By comparing the results from Figure 11a,b, it is evident that the acceleration variation for the healthy wheel\nis between − 1. to 2. m/s , while the defective one changes between − 70 to 100 m/s .**Figure 11.** Acceleration time-series on position 1 for ( **a** ) healthy wheel and wheel with semiimperfection profile, ( **b** ) damaged wheel.As the first step in the automatic damage detection method, damage-sensitive features are extracted from dynamic responses. As mentioned in Section 2.1, the ARX and CWT\nmodels are implemented and their performances as feature extractors are compared.\nTo establish a suitable ARX model order, AIC values are ascendingly ranked from\n1 to 70. An average AIC function is presented in Figure 12 based on 113 baseline analyses.\nIt is evident from this figure that after model order 40, the AIC values tend to stabilize,\nshowing that higher orders do not provide additional information. Therefore, the ARX models’ input and output orders are set to 40, and a total of 80 features are extracted. The\nsensor installed at position 5 ( yj in Equation (1)) is used as output, while each of the otherof the features extracted by the ARX models is higher than the CWT method.

In Figure 13b,c, a comparison of baseline and damaged scenarios shows similar variations in amplitude. In Figure 13d, the amplitude variation between healthy\nand damaged scenarios is evident, as the amplitude does not change much for the first\n143 passages, and then increases, which may indicate a wheel defect. Overall, the presenceregardless of the technique applied. Thus, the feature normalization step is implemented**Figure 13.** Feature extraction for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–feature 3, ( **b** ) ARX–feature 36, ( **c** ) CWT–featureout to obtain indicators that are more sensitive to damage and less sensitive to EOVs. The Latent Variable Method PCA is applied for data normalization. As explained in Section 5.1,\nfor all 173 train passages, 3-dimensional CWT-double-PCA-based feature matrices of\n173 × 468 are calculated for each sensor. At the same time, the ARX model is implementedsensor. Note that the PCA matrices have the same dimensions as the feature extraction step In Figure 14, the same four features shown in Figure 13 for sensor 1 are shown after\nimplementing PCA for all undamaged and damaged scenarios. During the modeling process, components with a cumulative percentage of variances higher than 80% are discarded. Therefore, the number of discarded rows is seventeen and two for CWT-doublePCA-based and ARX-PCA-based methods, respectively. The results obtained are quite\ndifferent depending on the method applied as a feature extractor. A reduction in theobserved in Figure 14a,b. However, CWT-double-PCA-based parameters in Figure 14c,d,\nshow a more effective normalization of the baseline features. Overall, both methods reduce**Figure 14.** Feature normalization for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based feature 3, ( **b** ) ARX–PCA–based\nfeature 36, ( **c** ) CWT–double–PCA-based feature 140, ( **d** ) CWT–double–PCA–based feature 266.To merge all the data obtained from the ARX and CWT methods, the Mahalanobis distance is implemented by applying a two-stage fusion process: in the first step, the\nfeatures from each sensor are merged and, in the second stage, the multi-sensor information is fused to enhance the sensibility to the damage. Therefore, in the first stage, Mahalanobis\ndistance transfers 468 CWT-double-PCA-based parameters into one column (173 × 1) for each sensor and train passage. At the same time, 80 ARX-PCA-based parameters are\nconverted to a single damage-sensitive feature (173 × 1). Figure 15 demonstrates theARX-PCA and CWT-double-PCA considering sensor 1. It is possible to observe that this process significantly improves damage detection sensitivity for both approaches.**Figure 15.** Features fusion for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based, ( **b** ) CWT–double–PCA–based.Afterwards, in the second stage, all sensor information is merged to improve the sensitivity to the damage even more.

Therefore, it is possible to conclude that using ARX models as feature extractors**Figure 17.** Automatic wheel defect detection ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based ( **b** ) CWT–double–PCA–based.To reduce the time of installation and maintenance costs, it is necessary to obtain an\noptimal number of sensors, as well as a suitable location to install them without compromising the quality of the detection. As a result, a parametric study is carried out using\naccelerometers at distinct locations. In this analysis, only CWT is used for feature extraction because, as shown in Figure 17b, it is the best technique (with no false positives) compared(as presented in Figure 10) in terms of the total number (two, four, and six) are analyzed and the effectiveness of the detection methodology is demonstrated in Figure 18. The results concluded that even with two sensors (one on each side of the rail), the proposed**Figure 18.** Automatic polygonized wheel detection based on CWT technique considering: ( **a** ) sixIn the previous section, the proposed approach to detect a defective wheel from a healthy one was implemented for accelerometers located on the rail.

On the other hand, to overcome some unpredictable oscillations in the measured responses and consequent failures in damage detection, some options can be taken.\nIn more complex structures, such as bridges and viaducts, there should be a greater susceptibility to damage when compared to areas of track sections on the foundation ground. If the structures are damaged, they may camouflage or cause false warnings. In a practical context, the use of sensors in an area of the track less prone to damage and where vibrationmethodology. Aligned on these assumptions, the location of the sensors was chosen on aAfter defining the AI approach for identifying wheel polygonization, two distinguished feature extraction methods, namely ARX and CWT, are compared. To avoid\nfalse alarm situations caused by environmental and operational effects, the latent variable method Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied. To reduce the volume of extracted data while retaining the most relevant information, as well as improve the ability to characterize the measured phenomenon, the data are merged using the Mahalanobis distance. As\na final step, an outlier analysis is employed to automatically distinguish a healthy wheel It should be highlighted that wheel flat identification was developed by Mosleh et al. ,\nwho demonstrated that the methodology is able to identify wheel flats. The validation of the proposed AI-based methodology herein, considering a polygonal wheel, is a clear step forward\nin terms of the proposed methodology’s effectiveness, allowing for a complete implementation**2.

By using the Mahalanobis distance, the features from each sensor can be effectively merged in the first stage. Moreover, a new Mahalanobis distance is applied\nagain in the second stage to integrate all sensor information. The outcome of this stepDI identifies a healthy or a defective wheel; a statistical confidence boundary (CB) isIn this study, the features are extracted based on autoregressive models with exogenous inputs (ARX) and continuous wavelet transform (CWT) models. The performance ofthe occurrence of gearbox failures. The ARX autoregressive model considers the predictive behavior of the system at a specific location, considering its history at the same\npoint and the predictive response at other measurement locations, being defined by the### xj = ∑ aixj−i +### ∑ bkyj−k + ε j (1)where xj, yj, and ε j are the output, input, as well as error term of the model at the signal value j . Moreover, ai, bk, ma, and mb are the parameters and the orders of the output and Initially, it is difficult to determine the most appropriate ARX model order. The key issue is that higher-order models could better match the data, but they may not generalize\nto other datasets. Otherwise, a low-order model is unlikely to capture the underlying physical system response. Several authors have noted the difficulty of defining a unique order for ARX models. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is reported to be one of the most effective optimization techniques . Based on the exchange between fit accuracy and the number of estimated parameters, AIC measures the goodness-of-fit of an estimatedparameters, respectively, and ε is the average sum-of-square residual ( SSR ) errors. To find out an optimum order, one should examine a wide range of orders and choose the orderStudies conducted by Li et al. showed good results in gearbox fault detection.\nCWT produces a two-dimensional set of coefficients from the analyzed signal. Although the Fourier transforms typically use sine waves as the basis for decomposition, other functionscan be selected for the wavelet shape due to signal properties. Two parameters define wavelet analysis: scale and translation. The CWT ( T ) of the signal x ( t ) is determined aswhere a and b are the scale and translation parameters, and ψ [∗] is the complex conjugate of the mother wavelet T that involves a continuous function in both time and frequency domains.\nAfter the implementation of a CWT on the evaluated signals, a PCA is performed\nfollowed by the extraction of four statistical parameters, resulting in significant data compression . Based on the p -by- q matrix X containing the extracted CWT features from the original signal evaluated by each sensor, where p is the measurement points number and q is the wavelets coefficients number, the principal components can be determinedwhere Ss represents the scores matrix, and T is a q -by- q orthonormal linear transformation matrix. In addition, four statistical parameters are extracted from the scores, Ss, including the root mean square (RMS), standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. Thus, a matrix p -by- q is transformed into a k -by- q matrix, where k equals 4. Consequently, a total of k × qenvironmental and operational variations (EOVs). For example, in damage detection, itare mostly sensitive to damage . Therefore, implementing a latent variable method,\nnamely the PCA, may efficiently reduce EOVs influences, without requiring the direct measurement of those effects. According to Bro and Smilde , PCA is a powerful and versatile method capable of providing an overview of complex multivariate data. PCA can be used to find and quantify patterns, generate new hypotheses, detect outliers, or find\nBy considering a m -by- f matrix X, taking into account features extracted from the dynamic responses, where m represents the train passages and f represents the number of\nfeatures extracted from sensors (i.e., k × q ), a transformation to another set of f features, Ss,\nis obtained by considering Equation (4). Considering the baseline condition, the covariance matrix ( C ) of the features is related to the covariance matrix of the scores Λ, as follows:where, Λ and T are matrices calculated by the singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix C . The columns of T are the eigenvectors and the diagonal matrix Λ, including\nthe eigenvalues of the matrix C in descending order. Thus, the eigenvalues stored in Λ areIt is possible to divide matrix Λ into two matrices with the first n eigenvalues and the remaining f-n eigenvalues. Determining the number of n -components is one of the\nchallenges in multivariate data interpretation. In this research study, n -components are\ndiscarded when the cumulative percentage of variance reaches 80% . Once n\nhas been selected, Equation (4) can be used to calculate the f-n components of matrix S. The transformation matrix T [ˆ] is constructed by the remaining f-n columns of matrix T . Using\nthe following function, the f-n components can be remapped to the main space:where, FPCA is m -by- f matrix of PCA features which is less sensitive to EOVs. Every sensorindex definition, is easy to implement and fast to process . For each simulation, the MD is considered to calculate a damage index (DI). Several damage identification studies haveDI . The MD is a well-known distance metric because it measures the distance\nbetween two points in a feature space containing two or more variables . Furthermore,\nit considers correlations between variables and does not depend on the scale of the features.\nIt can merge features from multiple sensors by performing data fusion. Mahalanobis\ndistance (namely here as DI ) is calculated by the following function:in which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−] , and is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The covariance matrix and mean vector intend to incorporate the baseline simulation. Based on the data derived from the\ndamaged system, a new observation would be far from the average of normal conditions.\nMahalanobis distances are calculated for each sensor and simulation. A matrix containing m Mahalanobis distances for i sensors is obtained from the above calculations.To automatically monitor train wheel conditions, the methodology performs outlier analysis. In Meixedo et al. and Mosleh et al. , this tool proved to be very efficient in\nclassifying the data as being related to a scenario with or without damage. Mahalanobisspace. A Gaussian distribution can be used to approximate the Mahalanobis distance, and statistical thresholds can be used to analyze outliers. By considering a mean value and standard deviation σ of the baseline feature vector, as well as the significance level α, itconsequently, when DI is equal to or higher than CB, a feature is considered to be an outlier.In the present research, the Laagrss freight train composed of five wagons is studied.\nAccording to the UIC classification, it can reach a top speed of 120 km/h . Each wagon has a tare weight of 27 t and can carry loads up to 52 t. A double freight wagon is shown incomponent. A rigid beam element was also used to connect the above-mentioned components.

The model is based on a multi-layer scheme,\nsimulating the ballast, sleepers, and rails, as shown in Figure 4. The railpads, resting on the sleepers under the rail, are simulated as spring elements connecting the sleepers and\nrail. The mass of the ballast is represented by elements of discrete mass points, while the\nrails and sleepers are modeled using beam elements, adopting the appropriate material properties for each one. Finally, spring-dashpot elements are also incorporated to consider\nfoundation flexibility. Table 2 presents the properties of the track model.ties are very small, their effects on wheel-rail contact cannot be neglected . Therefore,In real conditions, the wheels are not entirely smooth and have imperfections. Despite\ntheir small size, these out-of-roundness irregularities can cause extreme variations in the wheelrail contact forces, producing vibrations on the train and track components. A periodic radial\ntread irregularity around the wheel circumference characterizes the wheel polygonization.\nAccording to Peng , for wheel polygonization, the irregularity amplitudes should be higher than 0. mm. Inherent to polygonization, some parameters can geometrically characterize the phenomenon, such as the varying wavelengths (λ) in the function of the harmonic order (θ)Two groups of polygonal wheel profiles are generated for the numerical simulations,\none for undamaged scenarios and another for damaged scenarios, based on real wheel measurements, the irregularity amplitude spectra of which are presented in Figure 6.**Figure 6.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) ( **a** ) initial polygonalFor the first group of profiles, the measurement data obtained by Johansson et al.\nfor new wheels with wavelengths comprising 20 harmonics were used . Thebetween 0.135–2. m, being the upper limit of the perimeter of the wheel. For the second group of profiles, the measurement values for four wheels with polygonal damage obtained\nby Cai et al. were considered . The wheel pr i s are characterized by the\nwavelengths in the first 30 harmonics, with the 6th to 8th harmonic orders being dominant.\nThen, different irregularity wheel profiles are generated based on the sum of sine### w ( xw ) = ∑ Aθ sin [ψ] [θ]where Aθ is the amplitude of the sine function for each wavelength, which is calculated bywhere, as wre f = 1 µm. The wheel irregularity level ( Lw ) values are selected based on the\nirregularity spectrums of Figure 6, for both cases: initial polygonization or polygonal damage . Considering phase angles ( ψθ ) to the sine functions that are uniformly and randomly distributed between 0 and 2π, several wheel irregularities are In the case of polygonal damage, simulating different amplitudes are applied atobtain two different damage severities in the function of amplitude ranges, one between\n0. mm and 0. mm (a1) and the other between 0. mm and 1. mm (a2).

A graphical representation of the numerical model is shown in Figure 9. Note that the first wheel of the first wagon on the right side isA series of accelerometers are mounted along the track to detect a polygonized wheel.\nAccording to the results demonstrated in Mosleh et al. , the location of the most promising sensors for obtaining good results is on the rail. However, the possibility of placing the sensors on the sleepers was also analyzed, since their installation is much easier. Using a virtual wayside monitoring system, acceleration measurements were\nevaluated from 16 positions, as shown in Figure 10. In this figure, the numbers 1-to-4 andsleepers on the right and left sides, respectively, while the accelerations over the sleepers are measured by sensors located on positions 9-to-12 and 13-to-16.

Once validated,Based on several speeds, loading schemes, and unevenness profiles of the rail, Table 3\nsummarizes the simulations of the undamaged and damaged scenarios. Baseline scenariosconsider vehicle speeds between 40 and 120 km/h, and four unevenness profiles are considered for rail irregularities . A total of six types of loading schemes are\nconsidered: (i) a fully loaded train, (ii) a half-loaded train, (iii) an empty train, and trains with an unbalanced load in the transversal and longitudinal directions, namely (iv) UNB1,\n(v) UNB2, and (vi) UNB3. In accordance with UIC loading guidelines , differentgravity is longitudinally and transversally offset. For baseline scenarios, 113 simulationswheels with initial polygonal profiles. Therefore, in addition to 113 analyses with healthy wheels, 30 scenarios are considered with three semi-imperfection cases, including: (i) the right wheel on the front wheelset of the first wagon, (ii) the left wheel of the rear wheelset of the third wagon; (iii) the right wheel of the rear wheelset of the fifth wagon.

By comparing the results from Figure 11a,b, it is evident that the acceleration variation for the healthy wheel\nis between − 1. to 2. m/s , while the defective one changes between − 70 to 100 m/s .**Figure 11.** Acceleration time-series on position 1 for ( **a** ) healthy wheel and wheel with semiimperfection profile, ( **b** ) damaged wheel.As the first step in the automatic damage detection method, damage-sensitive features are extracted from dynamic responses. As mentioned in Section 2.1, the ARX and CWT\nmodels are implemented and their performances as feature extractors are compared.\nTo establish a suitable ARX model order, AIC values are ascendingly ranked from\n1 to 70. An average AIC function is presented in Figure 12 based on 113 baseline analyses.\nIt is evident from this figure that after model order 40, the AIC values tend to stabilize,\nshowing that higher orders do not provide additional information. Therefore, the ARX models’ input and output orders are set to 40, and a total of 80 features are extracted. The\nsensor installed at position 5 ( yj in Equation (1)) is used as output, while each of the otherof the features extracted by the ARX models is higher than the CWT method.

Overall, the presenceregardless of the technique applied. Thus, the feature normalization step is implemented**Figure 13.** Feature extraction for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–feature 3, ( **b** ) ARX–feature 36, ( **c** ) CWT–featureout to obtain indicators that are more sensitive to damage and less sensitive to EOVs. The Latent Variable Method PCA is applied for data normalization.

Note that the PCA matrices have the same dimensions as the feature extraction step In Figure 14, the same four features shown in Figure 13 for sensor 1 are shown after\nimplementing PCA for all undamaged and damaged scenarios. During the modeling process, components with a cumulative percentage of variances higher than 80% are discarded. Therefore, the number of discarded rows is seventeen and two for CWT-doublePCA-based and ARX-PCA-based methods, respectively. The results obtained are quite\ndifferent depending on the method applied as a feature extractor. A reduction in theobserved in Figure 14a,b.

Therefore, in the first stage, Mahalanobis\ndistance transfers 468 CWT-double-PCA-based parameters into one column (173 × 1) for each sensor and train passage. At the same time, 80 ARX-PCA-based parameters are\nconverted to a single damage-sensitive feature (173 × 1). Figure 15 demonstrates theARX-PCA and CWT-double-PCA considering sensor 1. It is possible to observe that this process significantly improves damage detection sensitivity for both approaches.**Figure 15.** Features fusion for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based, ( **b** ) CWT–double–PCA–based.Afterwards, in the second stage, all sensor information is merged to improve the sensitivity to the damage even more.

As a result, a parametric study is carried out using\naccelerometers at distinct locations. In this analysis, only CWT is used for feature extraction because, as shown in Figure 17b, it is the best technique (with no false positives) compared(as presented in Figure 10) in terms of the total number (two, four, and six) are analyzed and the effectiveness of the detection methodology is demonstrated in Figure 18. The results concluded that even with two sensors (one on each side of the rail), the proposed**Figure 18.** Automatic polygonized wheel detection based on CWT technique considering: ( **a** ) sixIn the previous section, the proposed approach to detect a defective wheel from a healthy one was implemented for accelerometers located on the rail.

In summary, despite the high precision for monitoring defective wheels, these on-board systems require a high installation cost to\nIn a wayside monitoring system, the wheel-rail contact interface plays a significant role.\nAt this point, the dynamic forces of wheel-rail interaction are established, which allows the acquisition of relevant information about various factors inherent to the traffic conditions .\nAlthough these components represent a high maintenance cost, serious accidents with high economic losses and possible human injuries can be avoided. Regarding railway safety, wheel defects are one of the main causes of accidents , causing interruptionsreliability. Furthermore, these defects promote negative effects on both the vehicle and\nFurthermore, wheels deteriorate over time due to wear and fatigue, which may develop various defects such as polygonization, flats and shelling, altering the wheel-rail contact characteristics and, consequently, causing greater impact forces .

It also increases noise emissions inside and outside the vehicle, and decreases comfort levels and railway safety . Moreover, depending on thethe wheel, the vibration frequencies caused by the defect can induce resonance effects in the wheelsets increasing the vibration on these components . In the last two decades,\npolygonization in wheels has been the subject of great interest in the scientific community.train wheels with harmonics of 1–20. In the research study by Cai et al. , the mechanism\nof polygon formation on metro wheels was investigated based on experimental measurements and numerical simulations. Further, in the study by Peng , the mechanisms of\nOOR formation on wheels were presented considering different wear prediction models.\nConsidering recent technological advances, it is now possible to develop and implement automatic methodologies for detecting and identifying damage in different systems [15–17] for railway applications. With the application of these intelligent techniques, it\nis not intended to completely replace the visual inspections already used for many decades,\nbut rather, the creation of a compatible procedure. Traditional visual inspection and control techniques are expensive, occur at intervals, and are prone to errors, it is important to\nmotivate the widespread use of Structural Integrity Monitoring (SIE) systems, especially in\nrecent infrastructures or in systems of high value to society, as in the case of railway systems . Thus, it is essential to develop automatic methodologies for detecting different Despite the widespread research on railway defect detection, to the knowledge of the authors, the reported literature on automatic wheel polygonization identification has been limited so far. Therefore, taking advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies, it isan early stage. The detection of polygonized wheels is largely carried out using accelerometers mounted on the vehicle. The parametric power spectral estimation and adaptive chirpresults, but with flaws in polygonization detection in the early stages [19–21].\nOn the other hand, previous studies have shown very good results using waysidelearning in detecting defects in railway vehicle wheels, namely wheel flat detections .\nThis type of methodology usually presents the following steps: (i) feature extractionusing data from accelerations or strains measured on the track, (ii) feature modelingand operational variations, (iii) data fusion to merge different features and/or sensors information, and (iv) features discrimination to classify the defects. The studies carriedidentifying singular irregularities on the wheel surface (i.e., wheel flat). In this context, itcomprehensive number of damages, namely the ones that may occur along the entire Several methods have been used for feature extraction, which converts time-series\ndata into more condensed information, allowing damage to be more easily observed.\nSymbolic data, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) [15–17], principal component analysis\n(PCA) , and autoregressive models [15–17] are examples of effective techniques for\nextracting damage-sensitive features for both static and dynamic monitoring. In timedomain applications where the measured quantity is acceleration, autoregressive modelson the system response, with the model parameters reflecting the properties of the system regardless of the sources of excitations. CWT and PCA have been developed over decades in different applications, in both time and frequency domains with various sensors. Despite this, they present some limitations, PCA does not consider the non-linearity of the data\nand CWT adds excess redundancy to the data, and it has a high computational cost, so For feature fusion, several algorithms, including neighborhood-preserving embedding\n(NPE) , neural networks , Mahalanobis distance , manifold learning methods , and kernel-based methods , have been recently employed. This data fusioninformation. Due to its simplicity and ability to reduce multivariate data, Mahalanobis\nRecent approaches based on machine learning have been applied for feature classification to differentiate a healthy wheel from a defective one . Typically, two different approaches are used: (i) unsupervised methods, in which models are trained using labeled data under the supervision of training data, such as k-means , self-organizing maps\n(SOM) , and cluster analysis; or (ii) supervised methods, in which models are not supervised using training datasets, such as Naive Bayes classifiers and k-Nearest Neighbor\nThis work aims: (i) to develop an unsupervised methodology to identify polygonized\nwheels; (ii) to evaluate the performance of different feature extraction techniques concerning their sensitivity to the detection of wheel polygonization, specifically those based on\nautoregressive exogenous models (ARX) and continuous wavelet transforms (CWT); (iii) towheel defect detection system. The unsupervised methodology to identify polygonized wheels consists of five phases: (i) data acquisition, (ii) feature extraction, (iii) feature The acquired track responses are influenced by parameters such as speed, irregularities, and load types. In this sense, different simulations of realistic scenarios of dynamicconditions. On the other hand, to overcome some unpredictable oscillations in the measured responses and consequent failures in damage detection, some options can be taken.\nIn more complex structures, such as bridges and viaducts, there should be a greater susceptibility to damage when compared to areas of track sections on the foundation ground. If the structures are damaged, they may camouflage or cause false warnings. In a practical context, the use of sensors in an area of the track less prone to damage and where vibrationmethodology. Aligned on these assumptions, the location of the sensors was chosen on aAfter defining the AI approach for identifying wheel polygonization, two distinguished feature extraction methods, namely ARX and CWT, are compared. To avoid\nfalse alarm situations caused by environmental and operational effects, the latent variable method Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied. To reduce the volume of extracted data while retaining the most relevant information, as well as improve the ability to characterize the measured phenomenon, the data are merged using the Mahalanobis distance. As\na final step, an outlier analysis is employed to automatically distinguish a healthy wheel It should be highlighted that wheel flat identification was developed by Mosleh et al. ,\nwho demonstrated that the methodology is able to identify wheel flats. The validation of the proposed AI-based methodology herein, considering a polygonal wheel, is a clear step forward\nin terms of the proposed methodology’s effectiveness, allowing for a complete implementation**2.

By using the Mahalanobis distance, the features from each sensor can be effectively merged in the first stage. Moreover, a new Mahalanobis distance is applied\nagain in the second stage to integrate all sensor information. The outcome of this stepDI identifies a healthy or a defective wheel; a statistical confidence boundary (CB) isIn this study, the features are extracted based on autoregressive models with exogenous inputs (ARX) and continuous wavelet transform (CWT) models.

The ARX autoregressive model considers the predictive behavior of the system at a specific location, considering its history at the same\npoint and the predictive response at other measurement locations, being defined by the### xj = ∑ aixj−i +### ∑ bkyj−k + ε j (1)where xj, yj, and ε j are the output, input, as well as error term of the model at the signal value j . Moreover, ai, bk, ma, and mb are the parameters and the orders of the output and Initially, it is difficult to determine the most appropriate ARX model order. The key issue is that higher-order models could better match the data, but they may not generalize\nto other datasets. Otherwise, a low-order model is unlikely to capture the underlying physical system response. Several authors have noted the difficulty of defining a unique order for ARX models. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is reported to be one of the most effective optimization techniques . Based on the exchange between fit accuracy and the number of estimated parameters, AIC measures the goodness-of-fit of an estimatedparameters, respectively, and ε is the average sum-of-square residual ( SSR ) errors. To find out an optimum order, one should examine a wide range of orders and choose the orderStudies conducted by Li et al. showed good results in gearbox fault detection.\nCWT produces a two-dimensional set of coefficients from the analyzed signal. Although the Fourier transforms typically use sine waves as the basis for decomposition, other functionscan be selected for the wavelet shape due to signal properties. Two parameters define wavelet analysis: scale and translation. The CWT ( T ) of the signal x ( t ) is determined aswhere a and b are the scale and translation parameters, and ψ [∗] is the complex conjugate of the mother wavelet T that involves a continuous function in both time and frequency domains.\nAfter the implementation of a CWT on the evaluated signals, a PCA is performed\nfollowed by the extraction of four statistical parameters, resulting in significant data compression . Based on the p -by- q matrix X containing the extracted CWT features from the original signal evaluated by each sensor, where p is the measurement points number and q is the wavelets coefficients number, the principal components can be determinedwhere Ss represents the scores matrix, and T is a q -by- q orthonormal linear transformation matrix. In addition, four statistical parameters are extracted from the scores, Ss, including the root mean square (RMS), standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. Thus, a matrix p -by- q is transformed into a k -by- q matrix, where k equals 4. Consequently, a total of k × qenvironmental and operational variations (EOVs). For example, in damage detection, itare mostly sensitive to damage . Therefore, implementing a latent variable method,\nnamely the PCA, may efficiently reduce EOVs influences, without requiring the direct measurement of those effects. According to Bro and Smilde , PCA is a powerful and versatile method capable of providing an overview of complex multivariate data. PCA can be used to find and quantify patterns, generate new hypotheses, detect outliers, or find\nBy considering a m -by- f matrix X, taking into account features extracted from the dynamic responses, where m represents the train passages and f represents the number of\nfeatures extracted from sensors (i.e., k × q ), a transformation to another set of f features, Ss,\nis obtained by considering Equation (4). Considering the baseline condition, the covariance matrix ( C ) of the features is related to the covariance matrix of the scores Λ, as follows:where, Λ and T are matrices calculated by the singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix C . The columns of T are the eigenvectors and the diagonal matrix Λ, including\nthe eigenvalues of the matrix C in descending order. Thus, the eigenvalues stored in Λ areIt is possible to divide matrix Λ into two matrices with the first n eigenvalues and the remaining f-n eigenvalues. Determining the number of n -components is one of the\nchallenges in multivariate data interpretation. In this research study, n -components are\ndiscarded when the cumulative percentage of variance reaches 80% . Once n\nhas been selected, Equation (4) can be used to calculate the f-n components of matrix S. The transformation matrix T [ˆ] is constructed by the remaining f-n columns of matrix T . Using\nthe following function, the f-n components can be remapped to the main space:where, FPCA is m -by- f matrix of PCA features which is less sensitive to EOVs. Every sensorindex definition, is easy to implement and fast to process . For each simulation, the MD is considered to calculate a damage index (DI). Several damage identification studies haveDI . The MD is a well-known distance metric because it measures the distance\nbetween two points in a feature space containing two or more variables . Furthermore,\nit considers correlations between variables and does not depend on the scale of the features.\nIt can merge features from multiple sensors by performing data fusion. Mahalanobis\ndistance (namely here as DI ) is calculated by the following function:in which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−] , and is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The covariance matrix and mean vector intend to incorporate the baseline simulation. Based on the data derived from the\ndamaged system, a new observation would be far from the average of normal conditions.\nMahalanobis distances are calculated for each sensor and simulation. A matrix containing m Mahalanobis distances for i sensors is obtained from the above calculations.To automatically monitor train wheel conditions, the methodology performs outlier analysis.

A Gaussian distribution can be used to approximate the Mahalanobis distance, and statistical thresholds can be used to analyze outliers. By considering a mean value and standard deviation σ of the baseline feature vector, as well as the significance level α, itconsequently, when DI is equal to or higher than CB, a feature is considered to be an outlier.In the present research, the Laagrss freight train composed of five wagons is studied.\nAccording to the UIC classification, it can reach a top speed of 120 km/h .

Table 2 presents the properties of the track model.ties are very small, their effects on wheel-rail contact cannot be neglected . Therefore,In real conditions, the wheels are not entirely smooth and have imperfections. Despite\ntheir small size, these out-of-roundness irregularities can cause extreme variations in the wheelrail contact forces, producing vibrations on the train and track components. A periodic radial\ntread irregularity around the wheel circumference characterizes the wheel polygonization.\nAccording to Peng , for wheel polygonization, the irregularity amplitudes should be higher than 0. mm. Inherent to polygonization, some parameters can geometrically characterize the phenomenon, such as the varying wavelengths (λ) in the function of the harmonic order (θ)Two groups of polygonal wheel profiles are generated for the numerical simulations,\none for undamaged scenarios and another for damaged scenarios, based on real wheel measurements, the irregularity amplitude spectra of which are presented in Figure 6.**Figure 6.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) ( **a** ) initial polygonalFor the first group of profiles, the measurement data obtained by Johansson et al.\nfor new wheels with wavelengths comprising 20 harmonics were used .

However, the possibility of placing the sensors on the sleepers was also analyzed, since their installation is much easier. Using a virtual wayside monitoring system, acceleration measurements were\nevaluated from 16 positions, as shown in Figure 10.

Therefore, in addition to 113 analyses with healthy wheels, 30 scenarios are considered with three semi-imperfection cases, including: (i) the right wheel on the front wheelset of the first wagon, (ii) the left wheel of the rear wheelset of the third wagon; (iii) the right wheel of the rear wheelset of the fifth wagon.

By comparing the results from Figure 11a,b, it is evident that the acceleration variation for the healthy wheel\nis between − 1. to 2. m/s , while the defective one changes between − 70 to 100 m/s .**Figure 11.** Acceleration time-series on position 1 for ( **a** ) healthy wheel and wheel with semiimperfection profile, ( **b** ) damaged wheel.As the first step in the automatic damage detection method, damage-sensitive features are extracted from dynamic responses. As mentioned in Section 2.1, the ARX and CWT\nmodels are implemented and their performances as feature extractors are compared.\nTo establish a suitable ARX model order, AIC values are ascendingly ranked from\n1 to 70. An average AIC function is presented in Figure 12 based on 113 baseline analyses.\nIt is evident from this figure that after model order 40, the AIC values tend to stabilize,\nshowing that higher orders do not provide additional information. Therefore, the ARX models’ input and output orders are set to 40, and a total of 80 features are extracted.

Further, in the study by Peng , the mechanisms of\nOOR formation on wheels were presented considering different wear prediction models.\nConsidering recent technological advances, it is now possible to develop and implement automatic methodologies for detecting and identifying damage in different systems [15–17] for railway applications. With the application of these intelligent techniques, it\nis not intended to completely replace the visual inspections already used for many decades,\nbut rather, the creation of a compatible procedure. Traditional visual inspection and control techniques are expensive, occur at intervals, and are prone to errors, it is important to\nmotivate the widespread use of Structural Integrity Monitoring (SIE) systems, especially in\nrecent infrastructures or in systems of high value to society, as in the case of railway systems . Thus, it is essential to develop automatic methodologies for detecting different Despite the widespread research on railway defect detection, to the knowledge of the authors, the reported literature on automatic wheel polygonization identification has been limited so far. Therefore, taking advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies, it isan early stage. The detection of polygonized wheels is largely carried out using accelerometers mounted on the vehicle. The parametric power spectral estimation and adaptive chirpresults, but with flaws in polygonization detection in the early stages [19–21].\nOn the other hand, previous studies have shown very good results using waysidelearning in detecting defects in railway vehicle wheels, namely wheel flat detections .\nThis type of methodology usually presents the following steps: (i) feature extractionusing data from accelerations or strains measured on the track, (ii) feature modelingand operational variations, (iii) data fusion to merge different features and/or sensors information, and (iv) features discrimination to classify the defects. The studies carriedidentifying singular irregularities on the wheel surface (i.e., wheel flat). In this context, itcomprehensive number of damages, namely the ones that may occur along the entire Several methods have been used for feature extraction, which converts time-series\ndata into more condensed information, allowing damage to be more easily observed.\nSymbolic data, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) [15–17], principal component analysis\n(PCA) , and autoregressive models [15–17] are examples of effective techniques for\nextracting damage-sensitive features for both static and dynamic monitoring.

CWT and PCA have been developed over decades in different applications, in both time and frequency domains with various sensors. Despite this, they present some limitations, PCA does not consider the non-linearity of the data\nand CWT adds excess redundancy to the data, and it has a high computational cost, so For feature fusion, several algorithms, including neighborhood-preserving embedding\n(NPE) , neural networks , Mahalanobis distance , manifold learning methods , and kernel-based methods , have been recently employed.

Due to its simplicity and ability to reduce multivariate data, Mahalanobis\nRecent approaches based on machine learning have been applied for feature classification to differentiate a healthy wheel from a defective one . Typically, two different approaches are used: (i) unsupervised methods, in which models are trained using labeled data under the supervision of training data, such as k-means , self-organizing maps\n(SOM) , and cluster analysis; or (ii) supervised methods, in which models are not supervised using training datasets, such as Naive Bayes classifiers and k-Nearest Neighbor\nThis work aims: (i) to develop an unsupervised methodology to identify polygonized\nwheels; (ii) to evaluate the performance of different feature extraction techniques concerning their sensitivity to the detection of wheel polygonization, specifically those based on\nautoregressive exogenous models (ARX) and continuous wavelet transforms (CWT); (iii) towheel defect detection system. The unsupervised methodology to identify polygonized wheels consists of five phases: (i) data acquisition, (ii) feature extraction, (iii) feature The acquired track responses are influenced by parameters such as speed, irregularities, and load types. In this sense, different simulations of realistic scenarios of dynamicconditions. On the other hand, to overcome some unpredictable oscillations in the measured responses and consequent failures in damage detection, some options can be taken.\nIn more complex structures, such as bridges and viaducts, there should be a greater susceptibility to damage when compared to areas of track sections on the foundation ground. If the structures are damaged, they may camouflage or cause false warnings. In a practical context, the use of sensors in an area of the track less prone to damage and where vibrationmethodology.

Moreover, ai, bk, ma, and mb are the parameters and the orders of the output and Initially, it is difficult to determine the most appropriate ARX model order. The key issue is that higher-order models could better match the data, but they may not generalize\nto other datasets. Otherwise, a low-order model is unlikely to capture the underlying physical system response. Several authors have noted the difficulty of defining a unique order for ARX models. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is reported to be one of the most effective optimization techniques . Based on the exchange between fit accuracy and the number of estimated parameters, AIC measures the goodness-of-fit of an estimatedparameters, respectively, and ε is the average sum-of-square residual ( SSR ) errors. To find out an optimum order, one should examine a wide range of orders and choose the orderStudies conducted by Li et al. showed good results in gearbox fault detection.\nCWT produces a two-dimensional set of coefficients from the analyzed signal. Although the Fourier transforms typically use sine waves as the basis for decomposition, other functionscan be selected for the wavelet shape due to signal properties. Two parameters define wavelet analysis: scale and translation. The CWT ( T ) of the signal x ( t ) is determined aswhere a and b are the scale and translation parameters, and ψ [∗] is the complex conjugate of the mother wavelet T that involves a continuous function in both time and frequency domains.\nAfter the implementation of a CWT on the evaluated signals, a PCA is performed\nfollowed by the extraction of four statistical parameters, resulting in significant data compression . Based on the p -by- q matrix X containing the extracted CWT features from the original signal evaluated by each sensor, where p is the measurement points number and q is the wavelets coefficients number, the principal components can be determinedwhere Ss represents the scores matrix, and T is a q -by- q orthonormal linear transformation matrix. In addition, four statistical parameters are extracted from the scores, Ss, including the root mean square (RMS), standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. Thus, a matrix p -by- q is transformed into a k -by- q matrix, where k equals 4. Consequently, a total of k × qenvironmental and operational variations (EOVs). For example, in damage detection, itare mostly sensitive to damage . Therefore, implementing a latent variable method,\nnamely the PCA, may efficiently reduce EOVs influences, without requiring the direct measurement of those effects. According to Bro and Smilde , PCA is a powerful and versatile method capable of providing an overview of complex multivariate data. PCA can be used to find and quantify patterns, generate new hypotheses, detect outliers, or find\nBy considering a m -by- f matrix X, taking into account features extracted from the dynamic responses, where m represents the train passages and f represents the number of\nfeatures extracted from sensors (i.e., k × q ), a transformation to another set of f features, Ss,\nis obtained by considering Equation (4). Considering the baseline condition, the covariance matrix ( C ) of the features is related to the covariance matrix of the scores Λ, as follows:where, Λ and T are matrices calculated by the singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix C . The columns of T are the eigenvectors and the diagonal matrix Λ, including\nthe eigenvalues of the matrix C in descending order. Thus, the eigenvalues stored in Λ areIt is possible to divide matrix Λ into two matrices with the first n eigenvalues and the remaining f-n eigenvalues. Determining the number of n -components is one of the\nchallenges in multivariate data interpretation. In this research study, n -components are\ndiscarded when the cumulative percentage of variance reaches 80% . Once n\nhas been selected, Equation (4) can be used to calculate the f-n components of matrix S. The transformation matrix T [ˆ] is constructed by the remaining f-n columns of matrix T . Using\nthe following function, the f-n components can be remapped to the main space:where, FPCA is m -by- f matrix of PCA features which is less sensitive to EOVs. Every sensorindex definition, is easy to implement and fast to process . For each simulation, the MD is considered to calculate a damage index (DI). Several damage identification studies haveDI . The MD is a well-known distance metric because it measures the distance\nbetween two points in a feature space containing two or more variables . Furthermore,\nit considers correlations between variables and does not depend on the scale of the features.\nIt can merge features from multiple sensors by performing data fusion. Mahalanobis\ndistance (namely here as DI ) is calculated by the following function:in which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−] , and is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The covariance matrix and mean vector intend to incorporate the baseline simulation. Based on the data derived from the\ndamaged system, a new observation would be far from the average of normal conditions.\nMahalanobis distances are calculated for each sensor and simulation. A matrix containing m Mahalanobis distances for i sensors is obtained from the above calculations.To automatically monitor train wheel conditions, the methodology performs outlier analysis.

Therefore,In real conditions, the wheels are not entirely smooth and have imperfections. Despite\ntheir small size, these out-of-roundness irregularities can cause extreme variations in the wheelrail contact forces, producing vibrations on the train and track components. A periodic radial\ntread irregularity around the wheel circumference characterizes the wheel polygonization.\nAccording to Peng , for wheel polygonization, the irregularity amplitudes should be higher than 0. mm. Inherent to polygonization, some parameters can geometrically characterize the phenomenon, such as the varying wavelengths (λ) in the function of the harmonic order (θ)Two groups of polygonal wheel profiles are generated for the numerical simulations,\none for undamaged scenarios and another for damaged scenarios, based on real wheel measurements, the irregularity amplitude spectra of which are presented in Figure 6.**Figure 6.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) ( **a** ) initial polygonalFor the first group of profiles, the measurement data obtained by Johansson et al.\nfor new wheels with wavelengths comprising 20 harmonics were used .

By comparing the results from Figure 11a,b, it is evident that the acceleration variation for the healthy wheel\nis between − 1. to 2. m/s , while the defective one changes between − 70 to 100 m/s .**Figure 11.** Acceleration time-series on position 1 for ( **a** ) healthy wheel and wheel with semiimperfection profile, ( **b** ) damaged wheel.As the first step in the automatic damage detection method, damage-sensitive features are extracted from dynamic responses. As mentioned in Section 2.1, the ARX and CWT\nmodels are implemented and their performances as feature extractors are compared.\nTo establish a suitable ARX model order, AIC values are ascendingly ranked from\n1 to 70. An average AIC function is presented in Figure 12 based on 113 baseline analyses.\nIt is evident from this figure that after model order 40, the AIC values tend to stabilize,\nshowing that higher orders do not provide additional information. Therefore, the ARX models’ input and output orders are set to 40, and a total of 80 features are extracted.

In summary, despite the high precision for monitoring defective wheels, these on-board systems require a high installation cost to\nIn a wayside monitoring system, the wheel-rail contact interface plays a significant role.\nAt this point, the dynamic forces of wheel-rail interaction are established, which allows the acquisition of relevant information about various factors inherent to the traffic conditions .\nAlthough these components represent a high maintenance cost, serious accidents with high economic losses and possible human injuries can be avoided.

In the research study by Cai et al. , the mechanism\nof polygon formation on metro wheels was investigated based on experimental measurements and numerical simulations. Further, in the study by Peng , the mechanisms of\nOOR formation on wheels were presented considering different wear prediction models.\nConsidering recent technological advances, it is now possible to develop and implement automatic methodologies for detecting and identifying damage in different systems [15–17] for railway applications. With the application of these intelligent techniques, it\nis not intended to completely replace the visual inspections already used for many decades,\nbut rather, the creation of a compatible procedure. Traditional visual inspection and control techniques are expensive, occur at intervals, and are prone to errors, it is important to\nmotivate the widespread use of Structural Integrity Monitoring (SIE) systems, especially in\nrecent infrastructures or in systems of high value to society, as in the case of railway systems . Thus, it is essential to develop automatic methodologies for detecting different Despite the widespread research on railway defect detection, to the knowledge of the authors, the reported literature on automatic wheel polygonization identification has been limited so far. Therefore, taking advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies, it isan early stage. The detection of polygonized wheels is largely carried out using accelerometers mounted on the vehicle. The parametric power spectral estimation and adaptive chirpresults, but with flaws in polygonization detection in the early stages [19–21].\nOn the other hand, previous studies have shown very good results using waysidelearning in detecting defects in railway vehicle wheels, namely wheel flat detections .\nThis type of methodology usually presents the following steps: (i) feature extractionusing data from accelerations or strains measured on the track, (ii) feature modelingand operational variations, (iii) data fusion to merge different features and/or sensors information, and (iv) features discrimination to classify the defects. The studies carriedidentifying singular irregularities on the wheel surface (i.e., wheel flat). In this context, itcomprehensive number of damages, namely the ones that may occur along the entire Several methods have been used for feature extraction, which converts time-series\ndata into more condensed information, allowing damage to be more easily observed.\nSymbolic data, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) [15–17], principal component analysis\n(PCA) , and autoregressive models [15–17] are examples of effective techniques for\nextracting damage-sensitive features for both static and dynamic monitoring. In timedomain applications where the measured quantity is acceleration, autoregressive modelson the system response, with the model parameters reflecting the properties of the system regardless of the sources of excitations. CWT and PCA have been developed over decades in different applications, in both time and frequency domains with various sensors. Despite this, they present some limitations, PCA does not consider the non-linearity of the data\nand CWT adds excess redundancy to the data, and it has a high computational cost, so For feature fusion, several algorithms, including neighborhood-preserving embedding\n(NPE) , neural networks , Mahalanobis distance , manifold learning methods , and kernel-based methods , have been recently employed.

Due to its simplicity and ability to reduce multivariate data, Mahalanobis\nRecent approaches based on machine learning have been applied for feature classification to differentiate a healthy wheel from a defective one . Typically, two different approaches are used: (i) unsupervised methods, in which models are trained using labeled data under the supervision of training data, such as k-means , self-organizing maps\n(SOM) , and cluster analysis; or (ii) supervised methods, in which models are not supervised using training datasets, such as Naive Bayes classifiers and k-Nearest Neighbor\nThis work aims: (i) to develop an unsupervised methodology to identify polygonized\nwheels; (ii) to evaluate the performance of different feature extraction techniques concerning their sensitivity to the detection of wheel polygonization, specifically those based on\nautoregressive exogenous models (ARX) and continuous wavelet transforms (CWT); (iii) towheel defect detection system. The unsupervised methodology to identify polygonized wheels consists of five phases: (i) data acquisition, (ii) feature extraction, (iii) feature The acquired track responses are influenced by parameters such as speed, irregularities, and load types. In this sense, different simulations of realistic scenarios of dynamicconditions. On the other hand, to overcome some unpredictable oscillations in the measured responses and consequent failures in damage detection, some options can be taken.\nIn more complex structures, such as bridges and viaducts, there should be a greater susceptibility to damage when compared to areas of track sections on the foundation ground. If the structures are damaged, they may camouflage or cause false warnings. In a practical context, the use of sensors in an area of the track less prone to damage and where vibrationmethodology. Aligned on these assumptions, the location of the sensors was chosen on aAfter defining the AI approach for identifying wheel polygonization, two distinguished feature extraction methods, namely ARX and CWT, are compared. To avoid\nfalse alarm situations caused by environmental and operational effects, the latent variable method Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied. To reduce the volume of extracted data while retaining the most relevant information, as well as improve the ability to characterize the measured phenomenon, the data are merged using the Mahalanobis distance. As\na final step, an outlier analysis is employed to automatically distinguish a healthy wheel It should be highlighted that wheel flat identification was developed by Mosleh et al. ,\nwho demonstrated that the methodology is able to identify wheel flats.

Moreover, ai, bk, ma, and mb are the parameters and the orders of the output and Initially, it is difficult to determine the most appropriate ARX model order. The key issue is that higher-order models could better match the data, but they may not generalize\nto other datasets. Otherwise, a low-order model is unlikely to capture the underlying physical system response. Several authors have noted the difficulty of defining a unique order for ARX models. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is reported to be one of the most effective optimization techniques . Based on the exchange between fit accuracy and the number of estimated parameters, AIC measures the goodness-of-fit of an estimatedparameters, respectively, and ε is the average sum-of-square residual ( SSR ) errors. To find out an optimum order, one should examine a wide range of orders and choose the orderStudies conducted by Li et al. showed good results in gearbox fault detection.\nCWT produces a two-dimensional set of coefficients from the analyzed signal. Although the Fourier transforms typically use sine waves as the basis for decomposition, other functionscan be selected for the wavelet shape due to signal properties. Two parameters define wavelet analysis: scale and translation. The CWT ( T ) of the signal x ( t ) is determined aswhere a and b are the scale and translation parameters, and ψ [∗] is the complex conjugate of the mother wavelet T that involves a continuous function in both time and frequency domains.\nAfter the implementation of a CWT on the evaluated signals, a PCA is performed\nfollowed by the extraction of four statistical parameters, resulting in significant data compression . Based on the p -by- q matrix X containing the extracted CWT features from the original signal evaluated by each sensor, where p is the measurement points number and q is the wavelets coefficients number, the principal components can be determinedwhere Ss represents the scores matrix, and T is a q -by- q orthonormal linear transformation matrix. In addition, four statistical parameters are extracted from the scores, Ss, including the root mean square (RMS), standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. Thus, a matrix p -by- q is transformed into a k -by- q matrix, where k equals 4. Consequently, a total of k × qenvironmental and operational variations (EOVs). For example, in damage detection, itare mostly sensitive to damage . Therefore, implementing a latent variable method,\nnamely the PCA, may efficiently reduce EOVs influences, without requiring the direct measurement of those effects. According to Bro and Smilde , PCA is a powerful and versatile method capable of providing an overview of complex multivariate data. PCA can be used to find and quantify patterns, generate new hypotheses, detect outliers, or find\nBy considering a m -by- f matrix X, taking into account features extracted from the dynamic responses, where m represents the train passages and f represents the number of\nfeatures extracted from sensors (i.e., k × q ), a transformation to another set of f features, Ss,\nis obtained by considering Equation (4). Considering the baseline condition, the covariance matrix ( C ) of the features is related to the covariance matrix of the scores Λ, as follows:where, Λ and T are matrices calculated by the singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix C . The columns of T are the eigenvectors and the diagonal matrix Λ, including\nthe eigenvalues of the matrix C in descending order. Thus, the eigenvalues stored in Λ areIt is possible to divide matrix Λ into two matrices with the first n eigenvalues and the remaining f-n eigenvalues. Determining the number of n -components is one of the\nchallenges in multivariate data interpretation. In this research study, n -components are\ndiscarded when the cumulative percentage of variance reaches 80% . Once n\nhas been selected, Equation (4) can be used to calculate the f-n components of matrix S. The transformation matrix T [ˆ] is constructed by the remaining f-n columns of matrix T . Using\nthe following function, the f-n components can be remapped to the main space:where, FPCA is m -by- f matrix of PCA features which is less sensitive to EOVs. Every sensorindex definition, is easy to implement and fast to process . For each simulation, the MD is considered to calculate a damage index (DI). Several damage identification studies haveDI . The MD is a well-known distance metric because it measures the distance\nbetween two points in a feature space containing two or more variables . Furthermore,\nit considers correlations between variables and does not depend on the scale of the features.\nIt can merge features from multiple sensors by performing data fusion. Mahalanobis\ndistance (namely here as DI ) is calculated by the following function:in which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−] , and is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The covariance matrix and mean vector intend to incorporate the baseline simulation. Based on the data derived from the\ndamaged system, a new observation would be far from the average of normal conditions.\nMahalanobis distances are calculated for each sensor and simulation. A matrix containing m Mahalanobis distances for i sensors is obtained from the above calculations.To automatically monitor train wheel conditions, the methodology performs outlier analysis.

A Gaussian distribution can be used to approximate the Mahalanobis distance, and statistical thresholds can be used to analyze outliers. By considering a mean value and standard deviation σ of the baseline feature vector, as well as the significance level α, itconsequently, when DI is equal to or higher than CB, a feature is considered to be an outlier.In the present research, the Laagrss freight train composed of five wagons is studied.\nAccording to the UIC classification, it can reach a top speed of 120 km/h .

Table 2 presents the properties of the track model.ties are very small, their effects on wheel-rail contact cannot be neglected . Therefore,In real conditions, the wheels are not entirely smooth and have imperfections. Despite\ntheir small size, these out-of-roundness irregularities can cause extreme variations in the wheelrail contact forces, producing vibrations on the train and track components. A periodic radial\ntread irregularity around the wheel circumference characterizes the wheel polygonization.\nAccording to Peng , for wheel polygonization, the irregularity amplitudes should be higher than 0. mm. Inherent to polygonization, some parameters can geometrically characterize the phenomenon, such as the varying wavelengths (λ) in the function of the harmonic order (θ)Two groups of polygonal wheel profiles are generated for the numerical simulations,\none for undamaged scenarios and another for damaged scenarios, based on real wheel measurements, the irregularity amplitude spectra of which are presented in Figure 6.**Figure 6.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) ( **a** ) initial polygonalFor the first group of profiles, the measurement data obtained by Johansson et al.\nfor new wheels with wavelengths comprising 20 harmonics were used .

Therefore, in addition to 113 analyses with healthy wheels, 30 scenarios are considered with three semi-imperfection cases, including: (i) the right wheel on the front wheelset of the first wagon, (ii) the left wheel of the rear wheelset of the third wagon; (iii) the right wheel of the rear wheelset of the fifth wagon.

By comparing the results from Figure 11a,b, it is evident that the acceleration variation for the healthy wheel\nis between − 1. to 2. m/s , while the defective one changes between − 70 to 100 m/s .**Figure 11.** Acceleration time-series on position 1 for ( **a** ) healthy wheel and wheel with semiimperfection profile, ( **b** ) damaged wheel.As the first step in the automatic damage detection method, damage-sensitive features are extracted from dynamic responses. As mentioned in Section 2.1, the ARX and CWT\nmodels are implemented and their performances as feature extractors are compared.\nTo establish a suitable ARX model order, AIC values are ascendingly ranked from\n1 to 70. An average AIC function is presented in Figure 12 based on 113 baseline analyses.\nIt is evident from this figure that after model order 40, the AIC values tend to stabilize,\nshowing that higher orders do not provide additional information. Therefore, the ARX models’ input and output orders are set to 40, and a total of 80 features are extracted.

Further, in the study by Peng , the mechanisms of\nOOR formation on wheels were presented considering different wear prediction models.\nConsidering recent technological advances, it is now possible to develop and implement automatic methodologies for detecting and identifying damage in different systems [15–17] for railway applications. With the application of these intelligent techniques, it\nis not intended to completely replace the visual inspections already used for many decades,\nbut rather, the creation of a compatible procedure. Traditional visual inspection and control techniques are expensive, occur at intervals, and are prone to errors, it is important to\nmotivate the widespread use of Structural Integrity Monitoring (SIE) systems, especially in\nrecent infrastructures or in systems of high value to society, as in the case of railway systems . Thus, it is essential to develop automatic methodologies for detecting different Despite the widespread research on railway defect detection, to the knowledge of the authors, the reported literature on automatic wheel polygonization identification has been limited so far. Therefore, taking advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies, it isan early stage. The detection of polygonized wheels is largely carried out using accelerometers mounted on the vehicle.

The studies carriedidentifying singular irregularities on the wheel surface (i.e., wheel flat). In this context, itcomprehensive number of damages, namely the ones that may occur along the entire Several methods have been used for feature extraction, which converts time-series\ndata into more condensed information, allowing damage to be more easily observed.\nSymbolic data, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) [15–17], principal component analysis\n(PCA) , and autoregressive models [15–17] are examples of effective techniques for\nextracting damage-sensitive features for both static and dynamic monitoring.

Typically, two different approaches are used: (i) unsupervised methods, in which models are trained using labeled data under the supervision of training data, such as k-means , self-organizing maps\n(SOM) , and cluster analysis; or (ii) supervised methods, in which models are not supervised using training datasets, such as Naive Bayes classifiers and k-Nearest Neighbor\nThis work aims: (i) to develop an unsupervised methodology to identify polygonized\nwheels; (ii) to evaluate the performance of different feature extraction techniques concerning their sensitivity to the detection of wheel polygonization, specifically those based on\nautoregressive exogenous models (ARX) and continuous wavelet transforms (CWT); (iii) towheel defect detection system.

In this sense, different simulations of realistic scenarios of dynamicconditions. On the other hand, to overcome some unpredictable oscillations in the measured responses and consequent failures in damage detection, some options can be taken.\nIn more complex structures, such as bridges and viaducts, there should be a greater susceptibility to damage when compared to areas of track sections on the foundation ground. If the structures are damaged, they may camouflage or cause false warnings. In a practical context, the use of sensors in an area of the track less prone to damage and where vibrationmethodology.

Moreover, ai, bk, ma, and mb are the parameters and the orders of the output and Initially, it is difficult to determine the most appropriate ARX model order. The key issue is that higher-order models could better match the data, but they may not generalize\nto other datasets. Otherwise, a low-order model is unlikely to capture the underlying physical system response. Several authors have noted the difficulty of defining a unique order for ARX models. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is reported to be one of the most effective optimization techniques . Based on the exchange between fit accuracy and the number of estimated parameters, AIC measures the goodness-of-fit of an estimatedparameters, respectively, and ε is the average sum-of-square residual ( SSR ) errors. To find out an optimum order, one should examine a wide range of orders and choose the orderStudies conducted by Li et al. showed good results in gearbox fault detection.\nCWT produces a two-dimensional set of coefficients from the analyzed signal. Although the Fourier transforms typically use sine waves as the basis for decomposition, other functionscan be selected for the wavelet shape due to signal properties. Two parameters define wavelet analysis: scale and translation. The CWT ( T ) of the signal x ( t ) is determined aswhere a and b are the scale and translation parameters, and ψ [∗] is the complex conjugate of the mother wavelet T that involves a continuous function in both time and frequency domains.\nAfter the implementation of a CWT on the evaluated signals, a PCA is performed\nfollowed by the extraction of four statistical parameters, resulting in significant data compression . Based on the p -by- q matrix X containing the extracted CWT features from the original signal evaluated by each sensor, where p is the measurement points number and q is the wavelets coefficients number, the principal components can be determinedwhere Ss represents the scores matrix, and T is a q -by- q orthonormal linear transformation matrix. In addition, four statistical parameters are extracted from the scores, Ss, including the root mean square (RMS), standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. Thus, a matrix p -by- q is transformed into a k -by- q matrix, where k equals 4. Consequently, a total of k × qenvironmental and operational variations (EOVs). For example, in damage detection, itare mostly sensitive to damage . Therefore, implementing a latent variable method,\nnamely the PCA, may efficiently reduce EOVs influences, without requiring the direct measurement of those effects. According to Bro and Smilde , PCA is a powerful and versatile method capable of providing an overview of complex multivariate data. PCA can be used to find and quantify patterns, generate new hypotheses, detect outliers, or find\nBy considering a m -by- f matrix X, taking into account features extracted from the dynamic responses, where m represents the train passages and f represents the number of\nfeatures extracted from sensors (i.e., k × q ), a transformation to another set of f features, Ss,\nis obtained by considering Equation (4). Considering the baseline condition, the covariance matrix ( C ) of the features is related to the covariance matrix of the scores Λ, as follows:where, Λ and T are matrices calculated by the singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix C . The columns of T are the eigenvectors and the diagonal matrix Λ, including\nthe eigenvalues of the matrix C in descending order. Thus, the eigenvalues stored in Λ areIt is possible to divide matrix Λ into two matrices with the first n eigenvalues and the remaining f-n eigenvalues. Determining the number of n -components is one of the\nchallenges in multivariate data interpretation. In this research study, n -components are\ndiscarded when the cumulative percentage of variance reaches 80% . Once n\nhas been selected, Equation (4) can be used to calculate the f-n components of matrix S. The transformation matrix T [ˆ] is constructed by the remaining f-n columns of matrix T . Using\nthe following function, the f-n components can be remapped to the main space:where, FPCA is m -by- f matrix of PCA features which is less sensitive to EOVs. Every sensorindex definition, is easy to implement and fast to process . For each simulation, the MD is considered to calculate a damage index (DI). Several damage identification studies haveDI . The MD is a well-known distance metric because it measures the distance\nbetween two points in a feature space containing two or more variables . Furthermore,\nit considers correlations between variables and does not depend on the scale of the features.\nIt can merge features from multiple sensors by performing data fusion. Mahalanobis\ndistance (namely here as DI ) is calculated by the following function:in which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−] , and is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The covariance matrix and mean vector intend to incorporate the baseline simulation. Based on the data derived from the\ndamaged system, a new observation would be far from the average of normal conditions.\nMahalanobis distances are calculated for each sensor and simulation. A matrix containing m Mahalanobis distances for i sensors is obtained from the above calculations.To automatically monitor train wheel conditions, the methodology performs outlier analysis.

Therefore,In real conditions, the wheels are not entirely smooth and have imperfections. Despite\ntheir small size, these out-of-roundness irregularities can cause extreme variations in the wheelrail contact forces, producing vibrations on the train and track components. A periodic radial\ntread irregularity around the wheel circumference characterizes the wheel polygonization.\nAccording to Peng , for wheel polygonization, the irregularity amplitudes should be higher than 0. mm. Inherent to polygonization, some parameters can geometrically characterize the phenomenon, such as the varying wavelengths (λ) in the function of the harmonic order (θ)Two groups of polygonal wheel profiles are generated for the numerical simulations,\none for undamaged scenarios and another for damaged scenarios, based on real wheel measurements, the irregularity amplitude spectra of which are presented in Figure 6.**Figure 6.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) ( **a** ) initial polygonalFor the first group of profiles, the measurement data obtained by Johansson et al.\nfor new wheels with wavelengths comprising 20 harmonics were used .

Once validated,Based on several speeds, loading schemes, and unevenness profiles of the rail, Table 3\nsummarizes the simulations of the undamaged and damaged scenarios. Baseline scenariosconsider vehicle speeds between 40 and 120 km/h, and four unevenness profiles are considered for rail irregularities . A total of six types of loading schemes are\nconsidered: (i) a fully loaded train, (ii) a half-loaded train, (iii) an empty train, and trains with an unbalanced load in the transversal and longitudinal directions, namely (iv) UNB1,\n(v) UNB2, and (vi) UNB3. In accordance with UIC loading guidelines , differentgravity is longitudinally and transversally offset. For baseline scenarios, 113 simulationswheels with initial polygonal profiles. Therefore, in addition to 113 analyses with healthy wheels, 30 scenarios are considered with three semi-imperfection cases, including: (i) the right wheel on the front wheelset of the first wagon, (ii) the left wheel of the rear wheelset of the third wagon; (iii) the right wheel of the rear wheelset of the fifth wagon. Furthermore,the front wheel on the right side of the first wagon as a polygonized wheel. These scenarioslow-pass Chebyshev type II digital filter.

The wheel with a semi-imperfection profile is located on the first wheel of the first wagon. This figure illustrates the similarity between the measured accelerations\nin each case due to the similar amplitude of healthy and semi-imperfection wheels.\nAcceleration time series at position 1 for damaged wheels are presented in Figure 11b,\nconsidering two different amplitudes of wheel irregularity profiles. By comparing the results from Figure 11a,b, it is evident that the acceleration variation for the healthy wheel\nis between − 1. to 2. m/s , while the defective one changes between − 70 to 100 m/s .**Figure 11.** Acceleration time-series on position 1 for ( **a** ) healthy wheel and wheel with semiimperfection profile, ( **b** ) damaged wheel.As the first step in the automatic damage detection method, damage-sensitive features are extracted from dynamic responses. As mentioned in Section 2.1, the ARX and CWT\nmodels are implemented and their performances as feature extractors are compared.\nTo establish a suitable ARX model order, AIC values are ascendingly ranked from\n1 to 70. An average AIC function is presented in Figure 12 based on 113 baseline analyses.\nIt is evident from this figure that after model order 40, the AIC values tend to stabilize,\nshowing that higher orders do not provide additional information. Therefore, the ARX models’ input and output orders are set to 40, and a total of 80 features are extracted. The\nsensor installed at position 5 ( yj in Equation (1)) is used as output, while each of the otherof the features extracted by the ARX models is higher than the CWT method.

In Figure 13b,c, a comparison of baseline and damaged scenarios shows similar variations in amplitude. In Figure 13d, the amplitude variation between healthy\nand damaged scenarios is evident, as the amplitude does not change much for the first\n143 passages, and then increases, which may indicate a wheel defect. Overall, the presenceregardless of the technique applied. Thus, the feature normalization step is implemented**Figure 13.** Feature extraction for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–feature 3, ( **b** ) ARX–feature 36, ( **c** ) CWT–featureout to obtain indicators that are more sensitive to damage and less sensitive to EOVs. The Latent Variable Method PCA is applied for data normalization. As explained in Section 5.1,\nfor all 173 train passages, 3-dimensional CWT-double-PCA-based feature matrices of\n173 × 468 are calculated for each sensor. At the same time, the ARX model is implementedsensor. Note that the PCA matrices have the same dimensions as the feature extraction step In Figure 14, the same four features shown in Figure 13 for sensor 1 are shown after\nimplementing PCA for all undamaged and damaged scenarios. During the modeling process, components with a cumulative percentage of variances higher than 80% are discarded. Therefore, the number of discarded rows is seventeen and two for CWT-doublePCA-based and ARX-PCA-based methods, respectively. The results obtained are quite\ndifferent depending on the method applied as a feature extractor. A reduction in theobserved in Figure 14a,b. However, CWT-double-PCA-based parameters in Figure 14c,d,\nshow a more effective normalization of the baseline features.

Therefore, in the first stage, Mahalanobis\ndistance transfers 468 CWT-double-PCA-based parameters into one column (173 × 1) for each sensor and train passage. At the same time, 80 ARX-PCA-based parameters are\nconverted to a single damage-sensitive feature (173 × 1). Figure 15 demonstrates theARX-PCA and CWT-double-PCA considering sensor 1. It is possible to observe that this process significantly improves damage detection sensitivity for both approaches.**Figure 15.** Features fusion for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based, ( **b** ) CWT–double–PCA–based.Afterwards, in the second stage, all sensor information is merged to improve the sensitivity to the damage even more.

Therefore, it is possible to conclude that using ARX models as feature extractors**Figure 17.** Automatic wheel defect detection ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based ( **b** ) CWT–double–PCA–based.To reduce the time of installation and maintenance costs, it is necessary to obtain an\noptimal number of sensors, as well as a suitable location to install them without compromising the quality of the detection. As a result, a parametric study is carried out using\naccelerometers at distinct locations. In this analysis, only CWT is used for feature extraction because, as shown in Figure 17b, it is the best technique (with no false positives) compared(as presented in Figure 10) in terms of the total number (two, four, and six) are analyzed and the effectiveness of the detection methodology is demonstrated in Figure 18. The results concluded that even with two sensors (one on each side of the rail), the proposed**Figure 18.** Automatic polygonized wheel detection based on CWT technique considering: ( **a** ) sixIn the previous section, the proposed approach to detect a defective wheel from a healthy one was implemented for accelerometers located on the rail.

Thus, it is essential to develop automatic methodologies for detecting different Despite the widespread research on railway defect detection, to the knowledge of the authors, the reported literature on automatic wheel polygonization identification has been limited so far. Therefore, taking advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies, it isan early stage. The detection of polygonized wheels is largely carried out using accelerometers mounted on the vehicle.

On the other hand, to overcome some unpredictable oscillations in the measured responses and consequent failures in damage detection, some options can be taken.\nIn more complex structures, such as bridges and viaducts, there should be a greater susceptibility to damage when compared to areas of track sections on the foundation ground.

Moreover, ai, bk, ma, and mb are the parameters and the orders of the output and Initially, it is difficult to determine the most appropriate ARX model order. The key issue is that higher-order models could better match the data, but they may not generalize\nto other datasets. Otherwise, a low-order model is unlikely to capture the underlying physical system response. Several authors have noted the difficulty of defining a unique order for ARX models. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is reported to be one of the most effective optimization techniques . Based on the exchange between fit accuracy and the number of estimated parameters, AIC measures the goodness-of-fit of an estimatedparameters, respectively, and ε is the average sum-of-square residual ( SSR ) errors. To find out an optimum order, one should examine a wide range of orders and choose the orderStudies conducted by Li et al. showed good results in gearbox fault detection.\nCWT produces a two-dimensional set of coefficients from the analyzed signal. Although the Fourier transforms typically use sine waves as the basis for decomposition, other functionscan be selected for the wavelet shape due to signal properties. Two parameters define wavelet analysis: scale and translation. The CWT ( T ) of the signal x ( t ) is determined aswhere a and b are the scale and translation parameters, and ψ [∗] is the complex conjugate of the mother wavelet T that involves a continuous function in both time and frequency domains.\nAfter the implementation of a CWT on the evaluated signals, a PCA is performed\nfollowed by the extraction of four statistical parameters, resulting in significant data compression . Based on the p -by- q matrix X containing the extracted CWT features from the original signal evaluated by each sensor, where p is the measurement points number and q is the wavelets coefficients number, the principal components can be determinedwhere Ss represents the scores matrix, and T is a q -by- q orthonormal linear transformation matrix. In addition, four statistical parameters are extracted from the scores, Ss, including the root mean square (RMS), standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. Thus, a matrix p -by- q is transformed into a k -by- q matrix, where k equals 4. Consequently, a total of k × qenvironmental and operational variations (EOVs). For example, in damage detection, itare mostly sensitive to damage . Therefore, implementing a latent variable method,\nnamely the PCA, may efficiently reduce EOVs influences, without requiring the direct measurement of those effects. According to Bro and Smilde , PCA is a powerful and versatile method capable of providing an overview of complex multivariate data. PCA can be used to find and quantify patterns, generate new hypotheses, detect outliers, or find\nBy considering a m -by- f matrix X, taking into account features extracted from the dynamic responses, where m represents the train passages and f represents the number of\nfeatures extracted from sensors (i.e., k × q ), a transformation to another set of f features, Ss,\nis obtained by considering Equation (4). Considering the baseline condition, the covariance matrix ( C ) of the features is related to the covariance matrix of the scores Λ, as follows:where, Λ and T are matrices calculated by the singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix C . The columns of T are the eigenvectors and the diagonal matrix Λ, including\nthe eigenvalues of the matrix C in descending order. Thus, the eigenvalues stored in Λ areIt is possible to divide matrix Λ into two matrices with the first n eigenvalues and the remaining f-n eigenvalues. Determining the number of n -components is one of the\nchallenges in multivariate data interpretation. In this research study, n -components are\ndiscarded when the cumulative percentage of variance reaches 80% . Once n\nhas been selected, Equation (4) can be used to calculate the f-n components of matrix S. The transformation matrix T [ˆ] is constructed by the remaining f-n columns of matrix T . Using\nthe following function, the f-n components can be remapped to the main space:where, FPCA is m -by- f matrix of PCA features which is less sensitive to EOVs. Every sensorindex definition, is easy to implement and fast to process . For each simulation, the MD is considered to calculate a damage index (DI). Several damage identification studies haveDI . The MD is a well-known distance metric because it measures the distance\nbetween two points in a feature space containing two or more variables . Furthermore,\nit considers correlations between variables and does not depend on the scale of the features.\nIt can merge features from multiple sensors by performing data fusion. Mahalanobis\ndistance (namely here as DI ) is calculated by the following function:in which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−] , and is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The covariance matrix and mean vector intend to incorporate the baseline simulation. Based on the data derived from the\ndamaged system, a new observation would be far from the average of normal conditions.\nMahalanobis distances are calculated for each sensor and simulation. A matrix containing m Mahalanobis distances for i sensors is obtained from the above calculations.To automatically monitor train wheel conditions, the methodology performs outlier analysis.

The model is based on a multi-layer scheme,\nsimulating the ballast, sleepers, and rails, as shown in Figure 4. The railpads, resting on the sleepers under the rail, are simulated as spring elements connecting the sleepers and\nrail. The mass of the ballast is represented by elements of discrete mass points, while the\nrails and sleepers are modeled using beam elements, adopting the appropriate material properties for each one. Finally, spring-dashpot elements are also incorporated to consider\nfoundation flexibility. Table 2 presents the properties of the track model.ties are very small, their effects on wheel-rail contact cannot be neglected . Therefore,In real conditions, the wheels are not entirely smooth and have imperfections. Despite\ntheir small size, these out-of-roundness irregularities can cause extreme variations in the wheelrail contact forces, producing vibrations on the train and track components. A periodic radial\ntread irregularity around the wheel circumference characterizes the wheel polygonization.\nAccording to Peng , for wheel polygonization, the irregularity amplitudes should be higher than 0. mm. Inherent to polygonization, some parameters can geometrically characterize the phenomenon, such as the varying wavelengths (λ) in the function of the harmonic order (θ)Two groups of polygonal wheel profiles are generated for the numerical simulations,\none for undamaged scenarios and another for damaged scenarios, based on real wheel measurements, the irregularity amplitude spectra of which are presented in Figure 6.**Figure 6.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) ( **a** ) initial polygonalFor the first group of profiles, the measurement data obtained by Johansson et al.\nfor new wheels with wavelengths comprising 20 harmonics were used . Thebetween 0.135–2. m, being the upper limit of the perimeter of the wheel. For the second group of profiles, the measurement values for four wheels with polygonal damage obtained\nby Cai et al. were considered . The wheel pr i s are characterized by the\nwavelengths in the first 30 harmonics, with the 6th to 8th harmonic orders being dominant.\nThen, different irregularity wheel profiles are generated based on the sum of sine### w ( xw ) = ∑ Aθ sin [ψ] [θ]where Aθ is the amplitude of the sine function for each wavelength, which is calculated bywhere, as wre f = 1 µm. The wheel irregularity level ( Lw ) values are selected based on the\nirregularity spectrums of Figure 6, for both cases: initial polygonization or polygonal damage . Considering phase angles ( ψθ ) to the sine functions that are uniformly and randomly distributed between 0 and 2π, several wheel irregularities are In the case of polygonal damage, simulating different amplitudes are applied atobtain two different damage severities in the function of amplitude ranges, one between\n0. mm and 0. mm (a1) and the other between 0. mm and 1. mm (a2).

A graphical representation of the numerical model is shown in Figure 9. Note that the first wheel of the first wagon on the right side isA series of accelerometers are mounted along the track to detect a polygonized wheel.\nAccording to the results demonstrated in Mosleh et al. , the location of the most promising sensors for obtaining good results is on the rail. However, the possibility of placing the sensors on the sleepers was also analyzed, since their installation is much easier. Using a virtual wayside monitoring system, acceleration measurements were\nevaluated from 16 positions, as shown in Figure 10. In this figure, the numbers 1-to-4 andsleepers on the right and left sides, respectively, while the accelerations over the sleepers are measured by sensors located on positions 9-to-12 and 13-to-16.

Once validated,Based on several speeds, loading schemes, and unevenness profiles of the rail, Table 3\nsummarizes the simulations of the undamaged and damaged scenarios. Baseline scenariosconsider vehicle speeds between 40 and 120 km/h, and four unevenness profiles are considered for rail irregularities . A total of six types of loading schemes are\nconsidered: (i) a fully loaded train, (ii) a half-loaded train, (iii) an empty train, and trains with an unbalanced load in the transversal and longitudinal directions, namely (iv) UNB1,\n(v) UNB2, and (vi) UNB3. In accordance with UIC loading guidelines , differentgravity is longitudinally and transversally offset. For baseline scenarios, 113 simulationswheels with initial polygonal profiles. Therefore, in addition to 113 analyses with healthy wheels, 30 scenarios are considered with three semi-imperfection cases, including: (i) the right wheel on the front wheelset of the first wagon, (ii) the left wheel of the rear wheelset of the third wagon; (iii) the right wheel of the rear wheelset of the fifth wagon. Furthermore,the front wheel on the right side of the first wagon as a polygonized wheel. These scenarioslow-pass Chebyshev type II digital filter.

The wheel with a semi-imperfection profile is located on the first wheel of the first wagon. This figure illustrates the similarity between the measured accelerations\nin each case due to the similar amplitude of healthy and semi-imperfection wheels.\nAcceleration time series at position 1 for damaged wheels are presented in Figure 11b,\nconsidering two different amplitudes of wheel irregularity profiles. By comparing the results from Figure 11a,b, it is evident that the acceleration variation for the healthy wheel\nis between − 1. to 2. m/s , while the defective one changes between − 70 to 100 m/s .**Figure 11.** Acceleration time-series on position 1 for ( **a** ) healthy wheel and wheel with semiimperfection profile, ( **b** ) damaged wheel.As the first step in the automatic damage detection method, damage-sensitive features are extracted from dynamic responses. As mentioned in Section 2.1, the ARX and CWT\nmodels are implemented and their performances as feature extractors are compared.\nTo establish a suitable ARX model order, AIC values are ascendingly ranked from\n1 to 70. An average AIC function is presented in Figure 12 based on 113 baseline analyses.\nIt is evident from this figure that after model order 40, the AIC values tend to stabilize,\nshowing that higher orders do not provide additional information. Therefore, the ARX models’ input and output orders are set to 40, and a total of 80 features are extracted. The\nsensor installed at position 5 ( yj in Equation (1)) is used as output, while each of the otherof the features extracted by the ARX models is higher than the CWT method.

In Figure 13b,c, a comparison of baseline and damaged scenarios shows similar variations in amplitude. In Figure 13d, the amplitude variation between healthy\nand damaged scenarios is evident, as the amplitude does not change much for the first\n143 passages, and then increases, which may indicate a wheel defect. Overall, the presenceregardless of the technique applied. Thus, the feature normalization step is implemented**Figure 13.** Feature extraction for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–feature 3, ( **b** ) ARX–feature 36, ( **c** ) CWT–featureout to obtain indicators that are more sensitive to damage and less sensitive to EOVs. The Latent Variable Method PCA is applied for data normalization. As explained in Section 5.1,\nfor all 173 train passages, 3-dimensional CWT-double-PCA-based feature matrices of\n173 × 468 are calculated for each sensor. At the same time, the ARX model is implementedsensor. Note that the PCA matrices have the same dimensions as the feature extraction step In Figure 14, the same four features shown in Figure 13 for sensor 1 are shown after\nimplementing PCA for all undamaged and damaged scenarios. During the modeling process, components with a cumulative percentage of variances higher than 80% are discarded. Therefore, the number of discarded rows is seventeen and two for CWT-doublePCA-based and ARX-PCA-based methods, respectively. The results obtained are quite\ndifferent depending on the method applied as a feature extractor. A reduction in theobserved in Figure 14a,b. However, CWT-double-PCA-based parameters in Figure 14c,d,\nshow a more effective normalization of the baseline features.

Therefore, in the first stage, Mahalanobis\ndistance transfers 468 CWT-double-PCA-based parameters into one column (173 × 1) for each sensor and train passage. At the same time, 80 ARX-PCA-based parameters are\nconverted to a single damage-sensitive feature (173 × 1). Figure 15 demonstrates theARX-PCA and CWT-double-PCA considering sensor 1. It is possible to observe that this process significantly improves damage detection sensitivity for both approaches.**Figure 15.** Features fusion for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based, ( **b** ) CWT–double–PCA–based.Afterwards, in the second stage, all sensor information is merged to improve the sensitivity to the damage even more.

The significance level of the threshold is defined as 1%, as it has been commonly(173 passages), Figure 17 illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed methodology for distinguishing undamaged from damaged scenarios.

Therefore, it is possible to conclude that using ARX models as feature extractors**Figure 17.** Automatic wheel defect detection ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based ( **b** ) CWT–double–PCA–based.To reduce the time of installation and maintenance costs, it is necessary to obtain an\noptimal number of sensors, as well as a suitable location to install them without compromising the quality of the detection. As a result, a parametric study is carried out using\naccelerometers at distinct locations. In this analysis, only CWT is used for feature extraction because, as shown in Figure 17b, it is the best technique (with no false positives) compared(as presented in Figure 10) in terms of the total number (two, four, and six) are analyzed and the effectiveness of the detection methodology is demonstrated in Figure 18. The results concluded that even with two sensors (one on each side of the rail), the proposed**Figure 18.** Automatic polygonized wheel detection based on CWT technique considering: ( **a** ) sixIn the previous section, the proposed approach to detect a defective wheel from a healthy one was implemented for accelerometers located on the rail.

Thus, it is essential to develop automatic methodologies for detecting different Despite the widespread research on railway defect detection, to the knowledge of the authors, the reported literature on automatic wheel polygonization identification has been limited so far.

Based on the exchange between fit accuracy and the number of estimated parameters, AIC measures the goodness-of-fit of an estimatedparameters, respectively, and ε is the average sum-of-square residual ( SSR ) errors. To find out an optimum order, one should examine a wide range of orders and choose the orderStudies conducted by Li et al. showed good results in gearbox fault detection.\nCWT produces a two-dimensional set of coefficients from the analyzed signal. Although the Fourier transforms typically use sine waves as the basis for decomposition, other functionscan be selected for the wavelet shape due to signal properties. Two parameters define wavelet analysis: scale and translation. The CWT ( T ) of the signal x ( t ) is determined aswhere a and b are the scale and translation parameters, and ψ [∗] is the complex conjugate of the mother wavelet T that involves a continuous function in both time and frequency domains.\nAfter the implementation of a CWT on the evaluated signals, a PCA is performed\nfollowed by the extraction of four statistical parameters, resulting in significant data compression . Based on the p -by- q matrix X containing the extracted CWT features from the original signal evaluated by each sensor, where p is the measurement points number and q is the wavelets coefficients number, the principal components can be determinedwhere Ss represents the scores matrix, and T is a q -by- q orthonormal linear transformation matrix. In addition, four statistical parameters are extracted from the scores, Ss, including the root mean square (RMS), standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. Thus, a matrix p -by- q is transformed into a k -by- q matrix, where k equals 4. Consequently, a total of k × qenvironmental and operational variations (EOVs). For example, in damage detection, itare mostly sensitive to damage . Therefore, implementing a latent variable method,\nnamely the PCA, may efficiently reduce EOVs influences, without requiring the direct measurement of those effects. According to Bro and Smilde , PCA is a powerful and versatile method capable of providing an overview of complex multivariate data. PCA can be used to find and quantify patterns, generate new hypotheses, detect outliers, or find\nBy considering a m -by- f matrix X, taking into account features extracted from the dynamic responses, where m represents the train passages and f represents the number of\nfeatures extracted from sensors (i.e., k × q ), a transformation to another set of f features, Ss,\nis obtained by considering Equation (4). Considering the baseline condition, the covariance matrix ( C ) of the features is related to the covariance matrix of the scores Λ, as follows:where, Λ and T are matrices calculated by the singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix C . The columns of T are the eigenvectors and the diagonal matrix Λ, including\nthe eigenvalues of the matrix C in descending order. Thus, the eigenvalues stored in Λ areIt is possible to divide matrix Λ into two matrices with the first n eigenvalues and the remaining f-n eigenvalues. Determining the number of n -components is one of the\nchallenges in multivariate data interpretation. In this research study, n -components are\ndiscarded when the cumulative percentage of variance reaches 80% . Once n\nhas been selected, Equation (4) can be used to calculate the f-n components of matrix S. The transformation matrix T [ˆ] is constructed by the remaining f-n columns of matrix T . Using\nthe following function, the f-n components can be remapped to the main space:where, FPCA is m -by- f matrix of PCA features which is less sensitive to EOVs. Every sensorindex definition, is easy to implement and fast to process . For each simulation, the MD is considered to calculate a damage index (DI). Several damage identification studies haveDI . The MD is a well-known distance metric because it measures the distance\nbetween two points in a feature space containing two or more variables . Furthermore,\nit considers correlations between variables and does not depend on the scale of the features.\nIt can merge features from multiple sensors by performing data fusion. Mahalanobis\ndistance (namely here as DI ) is calculated by the following function:in which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−] , and is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The covariance matrix and mean vector intend to incorporate the baseline simulation. Based on the data derived from the\ndamaged system, a new observation would be far from the average of normal conditions.\nMahalanobis distances are calculated for each sensor and simulation. A matrix containing m Mahalanobis distances for i sensors is obtained from the above calculations.To automatically monitor train wheel conditions, the methodology performs outlier analysis. In Meixedo et al. and Mosleh et al. , this tool proved to be very efficient in\nclassifying the data as being related to a scenario with or without damage. Mahalanobisspace. A Gaussian distribution can be used to approximate the Mahalanobis distance, and statistical thresholds can be used to analyze outliers. By considering a mean value and standard deviation σ of the baseline feature vector, as well as the significance level α, itconsequently, when DI is equal to or higher than CB, a feature is considered to be an outlier.In the present research, the Laagrss freight train composed of five wagons is studied.\nAccording to the UIC classification, it can reach a top speed of 120 km/h . Each wagon has a tare weight of 27 t and can carry loads up to 52 t. A double freight wagon is shown incomponent. A rigid beam element was also used to connect the above-mentioned components.

The model is based on a multi-layer scheme,\nsimulating the ballast, sleepers, and rails, as shown in Figure 4. The railpads, resting on the sleepers under the rail, are simulated as spring elements connecting the sleepers and\nrail. The mass of the ballast is represented by elements of discrete mass points, while the\nrails and sleepers are modeled using beam elements, adopting the appropriate material properties for each one. Finally, spring-dashpot elements are also incorporated to consider\nfoundation flexibility. Table 2 presents the properties of the track model.ties are very small, their effects on wheel-rail contact cannot be neglected . Therefore,In real conditions, the wheels are not entirely smooth and have imperfections. Despite\ntheir small size, these out-of-roundness irregularities can cause extreme variations in the wheelrail contact forces, producing vibrations on the train and track components. A periodic radial\ntread irregularity around the wheel circumference characterizes the wheel polygonization.\nAccording to Peng , for wheel polygonization, the irregularity amplitudes should be higher than 0. mm. Inherent to polygonization, some parameters can geometrically characterize the phenomenon, such as the varying wavelengths (λ) in the function of the harmonic order (θ)Two groups of polygonal wheel profiles are generated for the numerical simulations,\none for undamaged scenarios and another for damaged scenarios, based on real wheel measurements, the irregularity amplitude spectra of which are presented in Figure 6.**Figure 6.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) ( **a** ) initial polygonalFor the first group of profiles, the measurement data obtained by Johansson et al.\nfor new wheels with wavelengths comprising 20 harmonics were used . Thebetween 0.135–2. m, being the upper limit of the perimeter of the wheel. For the second group of profiles, the measurement values for four wheels with polygonal damage obtained\nby Cai et al. were considered . The wheel pr i s are characterized by the\nwavelengths in the first 30 harmonics, with the 6th to 8th harmonic orders being dominant.\nThen, different irregularity wheel profiles are generated based on the sum of sine### w ( xw ) = ∑ Aθ sin [ψ] [θ]where Aθ is the amplitude of the sine function for each wavelength, which is calculated bywhere, as wre f = 1 µm. The wheel irregularity level ( Lw ) values are selected based on the\nirregularity spectrums of Figure 6, for both cases: initial polygonization or polygonal damage . Considering phase angles ( ψθ ) to the sine functions that are uniformly and randomly distributed between 0 and 2π, several wheel irregularities are In the case of polygonal damage, simulating different amplitudes are applied atobtain two different damage severities in the function of amplitude ranges, one between\n0. mm and 0. mm (a1) and the other between 0. mm and 1. mm (a2).

In this model, the train is coupled to the track using a 3D wheel-rail contact model, using Hertzian theory to calculate the normal contact forces andsoftware. It is important to note that both subsystems are initially separately modeled in\nmodels via a fully coupled approach .

A graphical representation of the numerical model is shown in Figure 9. Note that the first wheel of the first wagon on the right side isA series of accelerometers are mounted along the track to detect a polygonized wheel.\nAccording to the results demonstrated in Mosleh et al. , the location of the most promising sensors for obtaining good results is on the rail. However, the possibility of placing the sensors on the sleepers was also analyzed, since their installation is much easier. Using a virtual wayside monitoring system, acceleration measurements were\nevaluated from 16 positions, as shown in Figure 10. In this figure, the numbers 1-to-4 andsleepers on the right and left sides, respectively, while the accelerations over the sleepers are measured by sensors located on positions 9-to-12 and 13-to-16.

Once validated,Based on several speeds, loading schemes, and unevenness profiles of the rail, Table 3\nsummarizes the simulations of the undamaged and damaged scenarios. Baseline scenariosconsider vehicle speeds between 40 and 120 km/h, and four unevenness profiles are considered for rail irregularities . A total of six types of loading schemes are\nconsidered: (i) a fully loaded train, (ii) a half-loaded train, (iii) an empty train, and trains with an unbalanced load in the transversal and longitudinal directions, namely (iv) UNB1,\n(v) UNB2, and (vi) UNB3. In accordance with UIC loading guidelines , differentgravity is longitudinally and transversally offset. For baseline scenarios, 113 simulationswheels with initial polygonal profiles. Therefore, in addition to 113 analyses with healthy wheels, 30 scenarios are considered with three semi-imperfection cases, including: (i) the right wheel on the front wheelset of the first wagon, (ii) the left wheel of the rear wheelset of the third wagon; (iii) the right wheel of the rear wheelset of the fifth wagon.

This figure illustrates the similarity between the measured accelerations\nin each case due to the similar amplitude of healthy and semi-imperfection wheels.\nAcceleration time series at position 1 for damaged wheels are presented in Figure 11b,\nconsidering two different amplitudes of wheel irregularity profiles. By comparing the results from Figure 11a,b, it is evident that the acceleration variation for the healthy wheel\nis between − 1. to 2. m/s , while the defective one changes between − 70 to 100 m/s .**Figure 11.** Acceleration time-series on position 1 for ( **a** ) healthy wheel and wheel with semiimperfection profile, ( **b** ) damaged wheel.As the first step in the automatic damage detection method, damage-sensitive features are extracted from dynamic responses. As mentioned in Section 2.1, the ARX and CWT\nmodels are implemented and their performances as feature extractors are compared.\nTo establish a suitable ARX model order, AIC values are ascendingly ranked from\n1 to 70. An average AIC function is presented in Figure 12 based on 113 baseline analyses.\nIt is evident from this figure that after model order 40, the AIC values tend to stabilize,\nshowing that higher orders do not provide additional information. Therefore, the ARX models’ input and output orders are set to 40, and a total of 80 features are extracted. The\nsensor installed at position 5 ( yj in Equation (1)) is used as output, while each of the otherof the features extracted by the ARX models is higher than the CWT method.

In Figure 13b,c, a comparison of baseline and damaged scenarios shows similar variations in amplitude.

Overall, the presenceregardless of the technique applied. Thus, the feature normalization step is implemented**Figure 13.** Feature extraction for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–feature 3, ( **b** ) ARX–feature 36, ( **c** ) CWT–featureout to obtain indicators that are more sensitive to damage and less sensitive to EOVs. The Latent Variable Method PCA is applied for data normalization. As explained in Section 5.1,\nfor all 173 train passages, 3-dimensional CWT-double-PCA-based feature matrices of\n173 × 468 are calculated for each sensor. At the same time, the ARX model is implementedsensor. Note that the PCA matrices have the same dimensions as the feature extraction step In Figure 14, the same four features shown in Figure 13 for sensor 1 are shown after\nimplementing PCA for all undamaged and damaged scenarios. During the modeling process, components with a cumulative percentage of variances higher than 80% are discarded. Therefore, the number of discarded rows is seventeen and two for CWT-doublePCA-based and ARX-PCA-based methods, respectively. The results obtained are quite\ndifferent depending on the method applied as a feature extractor. A reduction in theobserved in Figure 14a,b. However, CWT-double-PCA-based parameters in Figure 14c,d,\nshow a more effective normalization of the baseline features. Overall, both methods reduce**Figure 14.** Feature normalization for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based feature 3, ( **b** ) ARX–PCA–based\nfeature 36, ( **c** ) CWT–double–PCA-based feature 140, ( **d** ) CWT–double–PCA–based feature 266.To merge all the data obtained from the ARX and CWT methods, the Mahalanobis distance is implemented by applying a two-stage fusion process: in the first step, the\nfeatures from each sensor are merged and, in the second stage, the multi-sensor information is fused to enhance the sensibility to the damage. Therefore, in the first stage, Mahalanobis\ndistance transfers 468 CWT-double-PCA-based parameters into one column (173 × 1) for each sensor and train passage. At the same time, 80 ARX-PCA-based parameters are\nconverted to a single damage-sensitive feature (173 × 1). Figure 15 demonstrates theARX-PCA and CWT-double-PCA considering sensor 1. It is possible to observe that this process significantly improves damage detection sensitivity for both approaches.**Figure 15.** Features fusion for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based, ( **b** ) CWT–double–PCA–based.Afterwards, in the second stage, all sensor information is merged to improve the sensitivity to the damage even more.

Therefore, it is possible to conclude that using ARX models as feature extractors**Figure 17.** Automatic wheel defect detection ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based ( **b** ) CWT–double–PCA–based.To reduce the time of installation and maintenance costs, it is necessary to obtain an\noptimal number of sensors, as well as a suitable location to install them without compromising the quality of the detection. As a result, a parametric study is carried out using\naccelerometers at distinct locations. In this analysis, only CWT is used for feature extraction because, as shown in Figure 17b, it is the best technique (with no false positives) compared(as presented in Figure 10) in terms of the total number (two, four, and six) are analyzed and the effectiveness of the detection methodology is demonstrated in Figure 18. The results concluded that even with two sensors (one on each side of the rail), the proposed**Figure 18.** Automatic polygonized wheel detection based on CWT technique considering: ( **a** ) sixIn the previous section, the proposed approach to detect a defective wheel from a healthy one was implemented for accelerometers located on the rail.

In this context, itcomprehensive number of damages, namely the ones that may occur along the entire Several methods have been used for feature extraction, which converts time-series\ndata into more condensed information, allowing damage to be more easily observed.\nSymbolic data, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) [15–17], principal component analysis\n(PCA) , and autoregressive models [15–17] are examples of effective techniques for\nextracting damage-sensitive features for both static and dynamic monitoring. In timedomain applications where the measured quantity is acceleration, autoregressive modelson the system response, with the model parameters reflecting the properties of the system regardless of the sources of excitations. CWT and PCA have been developed over decades in different applications, in both time and frequency domains with various sensors. Despite this, they present some limitations, PCA does not consider the non-linearity of the data\nand CWT adds excess redundancy to the data, and it has a high computational cost, so For feature fusion, several algorithms, including neighborhood-preserving embedding\n(NPE) , neural networks , Mahalanobis distance , manifold learning methods , and kernel-based methods , have been recently employed. This data fusioninformation. Due to its simplicity and ability to reduce multivariate data, Mahalanobis\nRecent approaches based on machine learning have been applied for feature classification to differentiate a healthy wheel from a defective one . Typically, two different approaches are used: (i) unsupervised methods, in which models are trained using labeled data under the supervision of training data, such as k-means , self-organizing maps\n(SOM) , and cluster analysis; or (ii) supervised methods, in which models are not supervised using training datasets, such as Naive Bayes classifiers and k-Nearest Neighbor\nThis work aims: (i) to develop an unsupervised methodology to identify polygonized\nwheels; (ii) to evaluate the performance of different feature extraction techniques concerning their sensitivity to the detection of wheel polygonization, specifically those based on\nautoregressive exogenous models (ARX) and continuous wavelet transforms (CWT); (iii) towheel defect detection system. The unsupervised methodology to identify polygonized wheels consists of five phases: (i) data acquisition, (ii) feature extraction, (iii) feature The acquired track responses are influenced by parameters such as speed, irregularities, and load types. In this sense, different simulations of realistic scenarios of dynamicconditions. On the other hand, to overcome some unpredictable oscillations in the measured responses and consequent failures in damage detection, some options can be taken.\nIn more complex structures, such as bridges and viaducts, there should be a greater susceptibility to damage when compared to areas of track sections on the foundation ground. If the structures are damaged, they may camouflage or cause false warnings. In a practical context, the use of sensors in an area of the track less prone to damage and where vibrationmethodology. Aligned on these assumptions, the location of the sensors was chosen on aAfter defining the AI approach for identifying wheel polygonization, two distinguished feature extraction methods, namely ARX and CWT, are compared. To avoid\nfalse alarm situations caused by environmental and operational effects, the latent variable method Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied. To reduce the volume of extracted data while retaining the most relevant information, as well as improve the ability to characterize the measured phenomenon, the data are merged using the Mahalanobis distance. As\na final step, an outlier analysis is employed to automatically distinguish a healthy wheel It should be highlighted that wheel flat identification was developed by Mosleh et al. ,\nwho demonstrated that the methodology is able to identify wheel flats. The validation of the proposed AI-based methodology herein, considering a polygonal wheel, is a clear step forward\nin terms of the proposed methodology’s effectiveness, allowing for a complete implementation**2.

By using the Mahalanobis distance, the features from each sensor can be effectively merged in the first stage. Moreover, a new Mahalanobis distance is applied\nagain in the second stage to integrate all sensor information. The outcome of this stepDI identifies a healthy or a defective wheel; a statistical confidence boundary (CB) isIn this study, the features are extracted based on autoregressive models with exogenous inputs (ARX) and continuous wavelet transform (CWT) models.

The ARX autoregressive model considers the predictive behavior of the system at a specific location, considering its history at the same\npoint and the predictive response at other measurement locations, being defined by the### xj = ∑ aixj−i +### ∑ bkyj−k + ε j (1)where xj, yj, and ε j are the output, input, as well as error term of the model at the signal value j . Moreover, ai, bk, ma, and mb are the parameters and the orders of the output and Initially, it is difficult to determine the most appropriate ARX model order. The key issue is that higher-order models could better match the data, but they may not generalize\nto other datasets. Otherwise, a low-order model is unlikely to capture the underlying physical system response. Several authors have noted the difficulty of defining a unique order for ARX models. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is reported to be one of the most effective optimization techniques . Based on the exchange between fit accuracy and the number of estimated parameters, AIC measures the goodness-of-fit of an estimatedparameters, respectively, and ε is the average sum-of-square residual ( SSR ) errors. To find out an optimum order, one should examine a wide range of orders and choose the orderStudies conducted by Li et al. showed good results in gearbox fault detection.\nCWT produces a two-dimensional set of coefficients from the analyzed signal. Although the Fourier transforms typically use sine waves as the basis for decomposition, other functionscan be selected for the wavelet shape due to signal properties. Two parameters define wavelet analysis: scale and translation. The CWT ( T ) of the signal x ( t ) is determined aswhere a and b are the scale and translation parameters, and ψ [∗] is the complex conjugate of the mother wavelet T that involves a continuous function in both time and frequency domains.\nAfter the implementation of a CWT on the evaluated signals, a PCA is performed\nfollowed by the extraction of four statistical parameters, resulting in significant data compression . Based on the p -by- q matrix X containing the extracted CWT features from the original signal evaluated by each sensor, where p is the measurement points number and q is the wavelets coefficients number, the principal components can be determinedwhere Ss represents the scores matrix, and T is a q -by- q orthonormal linear transformation matrix. In addition, four statistical parameters are extracted from the scores, Ss, including the root mean square (RMS), standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. Thus, a matrix p -by- q is transformed into a k -by- q matrix, where k equals 4. Consequently, a total of k × qenvironmental and operational variations (EOVs). For example, in damage detection, itare mostly sensitive to damage . Therefore, implementing a latent variable method,\nnamely the PCA, may efficiently reduce EOVs influences, without requiring the direct measurement of those effects. According to Bro and Smilde , PCA is a powerful and versatile method capable of providing an overview of complex multivariate data. PCA can be used to find and quantify patterns, generate new hypotheses, detect outliers, or find\nBy considering a m -by- f matrix X, taking into account features extracted from the dynamic responses, where m represents the train passages and f represents the number of\nfeatures extracted from sensors (i.e., k × q ), a transformation to another set of f features, Ss,\nis obtained by considering Equation (4). Considering the baseline condition, the covariance matrix ( C ) of the features is related to the covariance matrix of the scores Λ, as follows:where, Λ and T are matrices calculated by the singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix C . The columns of T are the eigenvectors and the diagonal matrix Λ, including\nthe eigenvalues of the matrix C in descending order. Thus, the eigenvalues stored in Λ areIt is possible to divide matrix Λ into two matrices with the first n eigenvalues and the remaining f-n eigenvalues. Determining the number of n -components is one of the\nchallenges in multivariate data interpretation. In this research study, n -components are\ndiscarded when the cumulative percentage of variance reaches 80% . Once n\nhas been selected, Equation (4) can be used to calculate the f-n components of matrix S. The transformation matrix T [ˆ] is constructed by the remaining f-n columns of matrix T . Using\nthe following function, the f-n components can be remapped to the main space:where, FPCA is m -by- f matrix of PCA features which is less sensitive to EOVs. Every sensorindex definition, is easy to implement and fast to process . For each simulation, the MD is considered to calculate a damage index (DI). Several damage identification studies haveDI . The MD is a well-known distance metric because it measures the distance\nbetween two points in a feature space containing two or more variables . Furthermore,\nit considers correlations between variables and does not depend on the scale of the features.\nIt can merge features from multiple sensors by performing data fusion. Mahalanobis\ndistance (namely here as DI ) is calculated by the following function:in which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−] , and is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The covariance matrix and mean vector intend to incorporate the baseline simulation. Based on the data derived from the\ndamaged system, a new observation would be far from the average of normal conditions.\nMahalanobis distances are calculated for each sensor and simulation. A matrix containing m Mahalanobis distances for i sensors is obtained from the above calculations.To automatically monitor train wheel conditions, the methodology performs outlier analysis. In Meixedo et al. and Mosleh et al. , this tool proved to be very efficient in\nclassifying the data as being related to a scenario with or without damage. Mahalanobisspace. A Gaussian distribution can be used to approximate the Mahalanobis distance, and statistical thresholds can be used to analyze outliers. By considering a mean value and standard deviation σ of the baseline feature vector, as well as the significance level α, itconsequently, when DI is equal to or higher than CB, a feature is considered to be an outlier.In the present research, the Laagrss freight train composed of five wagons is studied.\nAccording to the UIC classification, it can reach a top speed of 120 km/h . Each wagon has a tare weight of 27 t and can carry loads up to 52 t. A double freight wagon is shown incomponent. A rigid beam element was also used to connect the above-mentioned components.

The model is based on a multi-layer scheme,\nsimulating the ballast, sleepers, and rails, as shown in Figure 4. The railpads, resting on the sleepers under the rail, are simulated as spring elements connecting the sleepers and\nrail. The mass of the ballast is represented by elements of discrete mass points, while the\nrails and sleepers are modeled using beam elements, adopting the appropriate material properties for each one.

Table 2 presents the properties of the track model.ties are very small, their effects on wheel-rail contact cannot be neglected . Therefore,In real conditions, the wheels are not entirely smooth and have imperfections. Despite\ntheir small size, these out-of-roundness irregularities can cause extreme variations in the wheelrail contact forces, producing vibrations on the train and track components. A periodic radial\ntread irregularity around the wheel circumference characterizes the wheel polygonization.\nAccording to Peng , for wheel polygonization, the irregularity amplitudes should be higher than 0. mm. Inherent to polygonization, some parameters can geometrically characterize the phenomenon, such as the varying wavelengths (λ) in the function of the harmonic order (θ)Two groups of polygonal wheel profiles are generated for the numerical simulations,\none for undamaged scenarios and another for damaged scenarios, based on real wheel measurements, the irregularity amplitude spectra of which are presented in Figure 6.**Figure 6.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) ( **a** ) initial polygonalFor the first group of profiles, the measurement data obtained by Johansson et al.\nfor new wheels with wavelengths comprising 20 harmonics were used . Thebetween 0.135–2. m, being the upper limit of the perimeter of the wheel.

The wheel pr i s are characterized by the\nwavelengths in the first 30 harmonics, with the 6th to 8th harmonic orders being dominant.\nThen, different irregularity wheel profiles are generated based on the sum of sine### w ( xw ) = ∑ Aθ sin [ψ] [θ]where Aθ is the amplitude of the sine function for each wavelength, which is calculated bywhere, as wre f = 1 µm. The wheel irregularity level ( Lw ) values are selected based on the\nirregularity spectrums of Figure 6, for both cases: initial polygonization or polygonal damage . Considering phase angles ( ψθ ) to the sine functions that are uniformly and randomly distributed between 0 and 2π, several wheel irregularities are In the case of polygonal damage, simulating different amplitudes are applied atobtain two different damage severities in the function of amplitude ranges, one between\n0. mm and 0. mm (a1) and the other between 0. mm and 1. mm (a2).

A graphical representation of the numerical model is shown in Figure 9. Note that the first wheel of the first wagon on the right side isA series of accelerometers are mounted along the track to detect a polygonized wheel.\nAccording to the results demonstrated in Mosleh et al. , the location of the most promising sensors for obtaining good results is on the rail. However, the possibility of placing the sensors on the sleepers was also analyzed, since their installation is much easier. Using a virtual wayside monitoring system, acceleration measurements were\nevaluated from 16 positions, as shown in Figure 10. In this figure, the numbers 1-to-4 andsleepers on the right and left sides, respectively, while the accelerations over the sleepers are measured by sensors located on positions 9-to-12 and 13-to-16.

Once validated,Based on several speeds, loading schemes, and unevenness profiles of the rail, Table 3\nsummarizes the simulations of the undamaged and damaged scenarios. Baseline scenariosconsider vehicle speeds between 40 and 120 km/h, and four unevenness profiles are considered for rail irregularities . A total of six types of loading schemes are\nconsidered: (i) a fully loaded train, (ii) a half-loaded train, (iii) an empty train, and trains with an unbalanced load in the transversal and longitudinal directions, namely (iv) UNB1,\n(v) UNB2, and (vi) UNB3. In accordance with UIC loading guidelines , differentgravity is longitudinally and transversally offset. For baseline scenarios, 113 simulationswheels with initial polygonal profiles. Therefore, in addition to 113 analyses with healthy wheels, 30 scenarios are considered with three semi-imperfection cases, including: (i) the right wheel on the front wheelset of the first wagon, (ii) the left wheel of the rear wheelset of the third wagon; (iii) the right wheel of the rear wheelset of the fifth wagon.

By comparing the results from Figure 11a,b, it is evident that the acceleration variation for the healthy wheel\nis between − 1. to 2. m/s , while the defective one changes between − 70 to 100 m/s .**Figure 11.** Acceleration time-series on position 1 for ( **a** ) healthy wheel and wheel with semiimperfection profile, ( **b** ) damaged wheel.As the first step in the automatic damage detection method, damage-sensitive features are extracted from dynamic responses. As mentioned in Section 2.1, the ARX and CWT\nmodels are implemented and their performances as feature extractors are compared.\nTo establish a suitable ARX model order, AIC values are ascendingly ranked from\n1 to 70. An average AIC function is presented in Figure 12 based on 113 baseline analyses.\nIt is evident from this figure that after model order 40, the AIC values tend to stabilize,\nshowing that higher orders do not provide additional information. Therefore, the ARX models’ input and output orders are set to 40, and a total of 80 features are extracted. The\nsensor installed at position 5 ( yj in Equation (1)) is used as output, while each of the otherof the features extracted by the ARX models is higher than the CWT method.

Overall, the presenceregardless of the technique applied. Thus, the feature normalization step is implemented**Figure 13.** Feature extraction for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–feature 3, ( **b** ) ARX–feature 36, ( **c** ) CWT–featureout to obtain indicators that are more sensitive to damage and less sensitive to EOVs. The Latent Variable Method PCA is applied for data normalization.

Note that the PCA matrices have the same dimensions as the feature extraction step In Figure 14, the same four features shown in Figure 13 for sensor 1 are shown after\nimplementing PCA for all undamaged and damaged scenarios. During the modeling process, components with a cumulative percentage of variances higher than 80% are discarded. Therefore, the number of discarded rows is seventeen and two for CWT-doublePCA-based and ARX-PCA-based methods, respectively. The results obtained are quite\ndifferent depending on the method applied as a feature extractor. A reduction in theobserved in Figure 14a,b. However, CWT-double-PCA-based parameters in Figure 14c,d,\nshow a more effective normalization of the baseline features.

Therefore, in the first stage, Mahalanobis\ndistance transfers 468 CWT-double-PCA-based parameters into one column (173 × 1) for each sensor and train passage. At the same time, 80 ARX-PCA-based parameters are\nconverted to a single damage-sensitive feature (173 × 1). Figure 15 demonstrates theARX-PCA and CWT-double-PCA considering sensor 1. It is possible to observe that this process significantly improves damage detection sensitivity for both approaches.**Figure 15.** Features fusion for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based, ( **b** ) CWT–double–PCA–based.Afterwards, in the second stage, all sensor information is merged to improve the sensitivity to the damage even more.

As a result, a parametric study is carried out using\naccelerometers at distinct locations. In this analysis, only CWT is used for feature extraction because, as shown in Figure 17b, it is the best technique (with no false positives) compared(as presented in Figure 10) in terms of the total number (two, four, and six) are analyzed and the effectiveness of the detection methodology is demonstrated in Figure 18. The results concluded that even with two sensors (one on each side of the rail), the proposed**Figure 18.** Automatic polygonized wheel detection based on CWT technique considering: ( **a** ) sixIn the previous section, the proposed approach to detect a defective wheel from a healthy one was implemented for accelerometers located on the rail.

Further, in the study by Peng , the mechanisms of\nOOR formation on wheels were presented considering different wear prediction models.\nConsidering recent technological advances, it is now possible to develop and implement automatic methodologies for detecting and identifying damage in different systems [15–17] for railway applications. With the application of these intelligent techniques, it\nis not intended to completely replace the visual inspections already used for many decades,\nbut rather, the creation of a compatible procedure. Traditional visual inspection and control techniques are expensive, occur at intervals, and are prone to errors, it is important to\nmotivate the widespread use of Structural Integrity Monitoring (SIE) systems, especially in\nrecent infrastructures or in systems of high value to society, as in the case of railway systems . Thus, it is essential to develop automatic methodologies for detecting different Despite the widespread research on railway defect detection, to the knowledge of the authors, the reported literature on automatic wheel polygonization identification has been limited so far. Therefore, taking advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies, it isan early stage. The detection of polygonized wheels is largely carried out using accelerometers mounted on the vehicle. The parametric power spectral estimation and adaptive chirpresults, but with flaws in polygonization detection in the early stages [19–21].\nOn the other hand, previous studies have shown very good results using waysidelearning in detecting defects in railway vehicle wheels, namely wheel flat detections .\nThis type of methodology usually presents the following steps: (i) feature extractionusing data from accelerations or strains measured on the track, (ii) feature modelingand operational variations, (iii) data fusion to merge different features and/or sensors information, and (iv) features discrimination to classify the defects. The studies carriedidentifying singular irregularities on the wheel surface (i.e., wheel flat). In this context, itcomprehensive number of damages, namely the ones that may occur along the entire Several methods have been used for feature extraction, which converts time-series\ndata into more condensed information, allowing damage to be more easily observed.\nSymbolic data, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) [15–17], principal component analysis\n(PCA) , and autoregressive models [15–17] are examples of effective techniques for\nextracting damage-sensitive features for both static and dynamic monitoring.

CWT and PCA have been developed over decades in different applications, in both time and frequency domains with various sensors. Despite this, they present some limitations, PCA does not consider the non-linearity of the data\nand CWT adds excess redundancy to the data, and it has a high computational cost, so For feature fusion, several algorithms, including neighborhood-preserving embedding\n(NPE) , neural networks , Mahalanobis distance , manifold learning methods , and kernel-based methods , have been recently employed.

Due to its simplicity and ability to reduce multivariate data, Mahalanobis\nRecent approaches based on machine learning have been applied for feature classification to differentiate a healthy wheel from a defective one . Typically, two different approaches are used: (i) unsupervised methods, in which models are trained using labeled data under the supervision of training data, such as k-means , self-organizing maps\n(SOM) , and cluster analysis; or (ii) supervised methods, in which models are not supervised using training datasets, such as Naive Bayes classifiers and k-Nearest Neighbor\nThis work aims: (i) to develop an unsupervised methodology to identify polygonized\nwheels; (ii) to evaluate the performance of different feature extraction techniques concerning their sensitivity to the detection of wheel polygonization, specifically those based on\nautoregressive exogenous models (ARX) and continuous wavelet transforms (CWT); (iii) towheel defect detection system. The unsupervised methodology to identify polygonized wheels consists of five phases: (i) data acquisition, (ii) feature extraction, (iii) feature The acquired track responses are influenced by parameters such as speed, irregularities, and load types. In this sense, different simulations of realistic scenarios of dynamicconditions. On the other hand, to overcome some unpredictable oscillations in the measured responses and consequent failures in damage detection, some options can be taken.\nIn more complex structures, such as bridges and viaducts, there should be a greater susceptibility to damage when compared to areas of track sections on the foundation ground. If the structures are damaged, they may camouflage or cause false warnings. In a practical context, the use of sensors in an area of the track less prone to damage and where vibrationmethodology. Aligned on these assumptions, the location of the sensors was chosen on aAfter defining the AI approach for identifying wheel polygonization, two distinguished feature extraction methods, namely ARX and CWT, are compared. To avoid\nfalse alarm situations caused by environmental and operational effects, the latent variable method Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied. To reduce the volume of extracted data while retaining the most relevant information, as well as improve the ability to characterize the measured phenomenon, the data are merged using the Mahalanobis distance. As\na final step, an outlier analysis is employed to automatically distinguish a healthy wheel It should be highlighted that wheel flat identification was developed by Mosleh et al. ,\nwho demonstrated that the methodology is able to identify wheel flats.

Moreover, ai, bk, ma, and mb are the parameters and the orders of the output and Initially, it is difficult to determine the most appropriate ARX model order. The key issue is that higher-order models could better match the data, but they may not generalize\nto other datasets. Otherwise, a low-order model is unlikely to capture the underlying physical system response. Several authors have noted the difficulty of defining a unique order for ARX models. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is reported to be one of the most effective optimization techniques . Based on the exchange between fit accuracy and the number of estimated parameters, AIC measures the goodness-of-fit of an estimatedparameters, respectively, and ε is the average sum-of-square residual ( SSR ) errors. To find out an optimum order, one should examine a wide range of orders and choose the orderStudies conducted by Li et al. showed good results in gearbox fault detection.\nCWT produces a two-dimensional set of coefficients from the analyzed signal. Although the Fourier transforms typically use sine waves as the basis for decomposition, other functionscan be selected for the wavelet shape due to signal properties. Two parameters define wavelet analysis: scale and translation. The CWT ( T ) of the signal x ( t ) is determined aswhere a and b are the scale and translation parameters, and ψ [∗] is the complex conjugate of the mother wavelet T that involves a continuous function in both time and frequency domains.\nAfter the implementation of a CWT on the evaluated signals, a PCA is performed\nfollowed by the extraction of four statistical parameters, resulting in significant data compression . Based on the p -by- q matrix X containing the extracted CWT features from the original signal evaluated by each sensor, where p is the measurement points number and q is the wavelets coefficients number, the principal components can be determinedwhere Ss represents the scores matrix, and T is a q -by- q orthonormal linear transformation matrix. In addition, four statistical parameters are extracted from the scores, Ss, including the root mean square (RMS), standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. Thus, a matrix p -by- q is transformed into a k -by- q matrix, where k equals 4. Consequently, a total of k × qenvironmental and operational variations (EOVs). For example, in damage detection, itare mostly sensitive to damage . Therefore, implementing a latent variable method,\nnamely the PCA, may efficiently reduce EOVs influences, without requiring the direct measurement of those effects. According to Bro and Smilde , PCA is a powerful and versatile method capable of providing an overview of complex multivariate data. PCA can be used to find and quantify patterns, generate new hypotheses, detect outliers, or find\nBy considering a m -by- f matrix X, taking into account features extracted from the dynamic responses, where m represents the train passages and f represents the number of\nfeatures extracted from sensors (i.e., k × q ), a transformation to another set of f features, Ss,\nis obtained by considering Equation (4). Considering the baseline condition, the covariance matrix ( C ) of the features is related to the covariance matrix of the scores Λ, as follows:where, Λ and T are matrices calculated by the singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix C . The columns of T are the eigenvectors and the diagonal matrix Λ, including\nthe eigenvalues of the matrix C in descending order. Thus, the eigenvalues stored in Λ areIt is possible to divide matrix Λ into two matrices with the first n eigenvalues and the remaining f-n eigenvalues. Determining the number of n -components is one of the\nchallenges in multivariate data interpretation. In this research study, n -components are\ndiscarded when the cumulative percentage of variance reaches 80% . Once n\nhas been selected, Equation (4) can be used to calculate the f-n components of matrix S. The transformation matrix T [ˆ] is constructed by the remaining f-n columns of matrix T . Using\nthe following function, the f-n components can be remapped to the main space:where, FPCA is m -by- f matrix of PCA features which is less sensitive to EOVs. Every sensorindex definition, is easy to implement and fast to process . For each simulation, the MD is considered to calculate a damage index (DI). Several damage identification studies haveDI . The MD is a well-known distance metric because it measures the distance\nbetween two points in a feature space containing two or more variables . Furthermore,\nit considers correlations between variables and does not depend on the scale of the features.\nIt can merge features from multiple sensors by performing data fusion. Mahalanobis\ndistance (namely here as DI ) is calculated by the following function:in which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−] , and is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The covariance matrix and mean vector intend to incorporate the baseline simulation. Based on the data derived from the\ndamaged system, a new observation would be far from the average of normal conditions.\nMahalanobis distances are calculated for each sensor and simulation. A matrix containing m Mahalanobis distances for i sensors is obtained from the above calculations.To automatically monitor train wheel conditions, the methodology performs outlier analysis.

A Gaussian distribution can be used to approximate the Mahalanobis distance, and statistical thresholds can be used to analyze outliers. By considering a mean value and standard deviation σ of the baseline feature vector, as well as the significance level α, itconsequently, when DI is equal to or higher than CB, a feature is considered to be an outlier.In the present research, the Laagrss freight train composed of five wagons is studied.\nAccording to the UIC classification, it can reach a top speed of 120 km/h .

Therefore,In real conditions, the wheels are not entirely smooth and have imperfections. Despite\ntheir small size, these out-of-roundness irregularities can cause extreme variations in the wheelrail contact forces, producing vibrations on the train and track components. A periodic radial\ntread irregularity around the wheel circumference characterizes the wheel polygonization.\nAccording to Peng , for wheel polygonization, the irregularity amplitudes should be higher than 0. mm. Inherent to polygonization, some parameters can geometrically characterize the phenomenon, such as the varying wavelengths (λ) in the function of the harmonic order (θ)Two groups of polygonal wheel profiles are generated for the numerical simulations,\none for undamaged scenarios and another for damaged scenarios, based on real wheel measurements, the irregularity amplitude spectra of which are presented in Figure 6.**Figure 6.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) ( **a** ) initial polygonalFor the first group of profiles, the measurement data obtained by Johansson et al.\nfor new wheels with wavelengths comprising 20 harmonics were used .

By comparing the results from Figure 11a,b, it is evident that the acceleration variation for the healthy wheel\nis between − 1. to 2. m/s , while the defective one changes between − 70 to 100 m/s .**Figure 11.** Acceleration time-series on position 1 for ( **a** ) healthy wheel and wheel with semiimperfection profile, ( **b** ) damaged wheel.As the first step in the automatic damage detection method, damage-sensitive features are extracted from dynamic responses. As mentioned in Section 2.1, the ARX and CWT\nmodels are implemented and their performances as feature extractors are compared.\nTo establish a suitable ARX model order, AIC values are ascendingly ranked from\n1 to 70. An average AIC function is presented in Figure 12 based on 113 baseline analyses.\nIt is evident from this figure that after model order 40, the AIC values tend to stabilize,\nshowing that higher orders do not provide additional information. Therefore, the ARX models’ input and output orders are set to 40, and a total of 80 features are extracted.

Further, in the study by Peng , the mechanisms of\nOOR formation on wheels were presented considering different wear prediction models.\nConsidering recent technological advances, it is now possible to develop and implement automatic methodologies for detecting and identifying damage in different systems [15–17] for railway applications. With the application of these intelligent techniques, it\nis not intended to completely replace the visual inspections already used for many decades,\nbut rather, the creation of a compatible procedure. Traditional visual inspection and control techniques are expensive, occur at intervals, and are prone to errors, it is important to\nmotivate the widespread use of Structural Integrity Monitoring (SIE) systems, especially in\nrecent infrastructures or in systems of high value to society, as in the case of railway systems . Thus, it is essential to develop automatic methodologies for detecting different Despite the widespread research on railway defect detection, to the knowledge of the authors, the reported literature on automatic wheel polygonization identification has been limited so far. Therefore, taking advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies, it isan early stage. The detection of polygonized wheels is largely carried out using accelerometers mounted on the vehicle. The parametric power spectral estimation and adaptive chirpresults, but with flaws in polygonization detection in the early stages [19–21].\nOn the other hand, previous studies have shown very good results using waysidelearning in detecting defects in railway vehicle wheels, namely wheel flat detections .\nThis type of methodology usually presents the following steps: (i) feature extractionusing data from accelerations or strains measured on the track, (ii) feature modelingand operational variations, (iii) data fusion to merge different features and/or sensors information, and (iv) features discrimination to classify the defects. The studies carriedidentifying singular irregularities on the wheel surface (i.e., wheel flat). In this context, itcomprehensive number of damages, namely the ones that may occur along the entire Several methods have been used for feature extraction, which converts time-series\ndata into more condensed information, allowing damage to be more easily observed.\nSymbolic data, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) [15–17], principal component analysis\n(PCA) , and autoregressive models [15–17] are examples of effective techniques for\nextracting damage-sensitive features for both static and dynamic monitoring.

CWT and PCA have been developed over decades in different applications, in both time and frequency domains with various sensors.

Typically, two different approaches are used: (i) unsupervised methods, in which models are trained using labeled data under the supervision of training data, such as k-means , self-organizing maps\n(SOM) , and cluster analysis; or (ii) supervised methods, in which models are not supervised using training datasets, such as Naive Bayes classifiers and k-Nearest Neighbor\nThis work aims: (i) to develop an unsupervised methodology to identify polygonized\nwheels; (ii) to evaluate the performance of different feature extraction techniques concerning their sensitivity to the detection of wheel polygonization, specifically those based on\nautoregressive exogenous models (ARX) and continuous wavelet transforms (CWT); (iii) towheel defect detection system. The unsupervised methodology to identify polygonized wheels consists of five phases: (i) data acquisition, (ii) feature extraction, (iii) feature The acquired track responses are influenced by parameters such as speed, irregularities, and load types. In this sense, different simulations of realistic scenarios of dynamicconditions. On the other hand, to overcome some unpredictable oscillations in the measured responses and consequent failures in damage detection, some options can be taken.\nIn more complex structures, such as bridges and viaducts, there should be a greater susceptibility to damage when compared to areas of track sections on the foundation ground. If the structures are damaged, they may camouflage or cause false warnings. In a practical context, the use of sensors in an area of the track less prone to damage and where vibrationmethodology.

Moreover, ai, bk, ma, and mb are the parameters and the orders of the output and Initially, it is difficult to determine the most appropriate ARX model order. The key issue is that higher-order models could better match the data, but they may not generalize\nto other datasets. Otherwise, a low-order model is unlikely to capture the underlying physical system response. Several authors have noted the difficulty of defining a unique order for ARX models. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is reported to be one of the most effective optimization techniques . Based on the exchange between fit accuracy and the number of estimated parameters, AIC measures the goodness-of-fit of an estimatedparameters, respectively, and ε is the average sum-of-square residual ( SSR ) errors. To find out an optimum order, one should examine a wide range of orders and choose the orderStudies conducted by Li et al. showed good results in gearbox fault detection.\nCWT produces a two-dimensional set of coefficients from the analyzed signal. Although the Fourier transforms typically use sine waves as the basis for decomposition, other functionscan be selected for the wavelet shape due to signal properties. Two parameters define wavelet analysis: scale and translation. The CWT ( T ) of the signal x ( t ) is determined aswhere a and b are the scale and translation parameters, and ψ [∗] is the complex conjugate of the mother wavelet T that involves a continuous function in both time and frequency domains.\nAfter the implementation of a CWT on the evaluated signals, a PCA is performed\nfollowed by the extraction of four statistical parameters, resulting in significant data compression . Based on the p -by- q matrix X containing the extracted CWT features from the original signal evaluated by each sensor, where p is the measurement points number and q is the wavelets coefficients number, the principal components can be determinedwhere Ss represents the scores matrix, and T is a q -by- q orthonormal linear transformation matrix. In addition, four statistical parameters are extracted from the scores, Ss, including the root mean square (RMS), standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. Thus, a matrix p -by- q is transformed into a k -by- q matrix, where k equals 4. Consequently, a total of k × qenvironmental and operational variations (EOVs). For example, in damage detection, itare mostly sensitive to damage . Therefore, implementing a latent variable method,\nnamely the PCA, may efficiently reduce EOVs influences, without requiring the direct measurement of those effects. According to Bro and Smilde , PCA is a powerful and versatile method capable of providing an overview of complex multivariate data. PCA can be used to find and quantify patterns, generate new hypotheses, detect outliers, or find\nBy considering a m -by- f matrix X, taking into account features extracted from the dynamic responses, where m represents the train passages and f represents the number of\nfeatures extracted from sensors (i.e., k × q ), a transformation to another set of f features, Ss,\nis obtained by considering Equation (4). Considering the baseline condition, the covariance matrix ( C ) of the features is related to the covariance matrix of the scores Λ, as follows:where, Λ and T are matrices calculated by the singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix C . The columns of T are the eigenvectors and the diagonal matrix Λ, including\nthe eigenvalues of the matrix C in descending order. Thus, the eigenvalues stored in Λ areIt is possible to divide matrix Λ into two matrices with the first n eigenvalues and the remaining f-n eigenvalues. Determining the number of n -components is one of the\nchallenges in multivariate data interpretation. In this research study, n -components are\ndiscarded when the cumulative percentage of variance reaches 80% . Once n\nhas been selected, Equation (4) can be used to calculate the f-n components of matrix S. The transformation matrix T [ˆ] is constructed by the remaining f-n columns of matrix T . Using\nthe following function, the f-n components can be remapped to the main space:where, FPCA is m -by- f matrix of PCA features which is less sensitive to EOVs. Every sensorindex definition, is easy to implement and fast to process . For each simulation, the MD is considered to calculate a damage index (DI). Several damage identification studies haveDI . The MD is a well-known distance metric because it measures the distance\nbetween two points in a feature space containing two or more variables . Furthermore,\nit considers correlations between variables and does not depend on the scale of the features.\nIt can merge features from multiple sensors by performing data fusion. Mahalanobis\ndistance (namely here as DI ) is calculated by the following function:in which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−] , and is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The covariance matrix and mean vector intend to incorporate the baseline simulation. Based on the data derived from the\ndamaged system, a new observation would be far from the average of normal conditions.\nMahalanobis distances are calculated for each sensor and simulation. A matrix containing m Mahalanobis distances for i sensors is obtained from the above calculations.To automatically monitor train wheel conditions, the methodology performs outlier analysis.

Therefore,In real conditions, the wheels are not entirely smooth and have imperfections. Despite\ntheir small size, these out-of-roundness irregularities can cause extreme variations in the wheelrail contact forces, producing vibrations on the train and track components. A periodic radial\ntread irregularity around the wheel circumference characterizes the wheel polygonization.\nAccording to Peng , for wheel polygonization, the irregularity amplitudes should be higher than 0. mm. Inherent to polygonization, some parameters can geometrically characterize the phenomenon, such as the varying wavelengths (λ) in the function of the harmonic order (θ)Two groups of polygonal wheel profiles are generated for the numerical simulations,\none for undamaged scenarios and another for damaged scenarios, based on real wheel measurements, the irregularity amplitude spectra of which are presented in Figure 6.**Figure 6.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) ( **a** ) initial polygonalFor the first group of profiles, the measurement data obtained by Johansson et al.\nfor new wheels with wavelengths comprising 20 harmonics were used .

Once validated,Based on several speeds, loading schemes, and unevenness profiles of the rail, Table 3\nsummarizes the simulations of the undamaged and damaged scenarios. Baseline scenariosconsider vehicle speeds between 40 and 120 km/h, and four unevenness profiles are considered for rail irregularities .

Therefore, in addition to 113 analyses with healthy wheels, 30 scenarios are considered with three semi-imperfection cases, including: (i) the right wheel on the front wheelset of the first wagon, (ii) the left wheel of the rear wheelset of the third wagon; (iii) the right wheel of the rear wheelset of the fifth wagon.

By comparing the results from Figure 11a,b, it is evident that the acceleration variation for the healthy wheel\nis between − 1. to 2. m/s , while the defective one changes between − 70 to 100 m/s .**Figure 11.** Acceleration time-series on position 1 for ( **a** ) healthy wheel and wheel with semiimperfection profile, ( **b** ) damaged wheel.As the first step in the automatic damage detection method, damage-sensitive features are extracted from dynamic responses. As mentioned in Section 2.1, the ARX and CWT\nmodels are implemented and their performances as feature extractors are compared.\nTo establish a suitable ARX model order, AIC values are ascendingly ranked from\n1 to 70. An average AIC function is presented in Figure 12 based on 113 baseline analyses.\nIt is evident from this figure that after model order 40, the AIC values tend to stabilize,\nshowing that higher orders do not provide additional information. Therefore, the ARX models’ input and output orders are set to 40, and a total of 80 features are extracted. The\nsensor installed at position 5 ( yj in Equation (1)) is used as output, while each of the otherof the features extracted by the ARX models is higher than the CWT method.

With the application of these intelligent techniques, it\nis not intended to completely replace the visual inspections already used for many decades,\nbut rather, the creation of a compatible procedure. Traditional visual inspection and control techniques are expensive, occur at intervals, and are prone to errors, it is important to\nmotivate the widespread use of Structural Integrity Monitoring (SIE) systems, especially in\nrecent infrastructures or in systems of high value to society, as in the case of railway systems . Thus, it is essential to develop automatic methodologies for detecting different Despite the widespread research on railway defect detection, to the knowledge of the authors, the reported literature on automatic wheel polygonization identification has been limited so far. Therefore, taking advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies, it isan early stage. The detection of polygonized wheels is largely carried out using accelerometers mounted on the vehicle.

The studies carriedidentifying singular irregularities on the wheel surface (i.e., wheel flat).

Typically, two different approaches are used: (i) unsupervised methods, in which models are trained using labeled data under the supervision of training data, such as k-means , self-organizing maps\n(SOM) , and cluster analysis; or (ii) supervised methods, in which models are not supervised using training datasets, such as Naive Bayes classifiers and k-Nearest Neighbor\nThis work aims: (i) to develop an unsupervised methodology to identify polygonized\nwheels; (ii) to evaluate the performance of different feature extraction techniques concerning their sensitivity to the detection of wheel polygonization, specifically those based on\nautoregressive exogenous models (ARX) and continuous wavelet transforms (CWT); (iii) towheel defect detection system.

In this sense, different simulations of realistic scenarios of dynamicconditions. On the other hand, to overcome some unpredictable oscillations in the measured responses and consequent failures in damage detection, some options can be taken.\nIn more complex structures, such as bridges and viaducts, there should be a greater susceptibility to damage when compared to areas of track sections on the foundation ground. If the structures are damaged, they may camouflage or cause false warnings. In a practical context, the use of sensors in an area of the track less prone to damage and where vibrationmethodology.

Moreover, ai, bk, ma, and mb are the parameters and the orders of the output and Initially, it is difficult to determine the most appropriate ARX model order. The key issue is that higher-order models could better match the data, but they may not generalize\nto other datasets. Otherwise, a low-order model is unlikely to capture the underlying physical system response. Several authors have noted the difficulty of defining a unique order for ARX models. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is reported to be one of the most effective optimization techniques . Based on the exchange between fit accuracy and the number of estimated parameters, AIC measures the goodness-of-fit of an estimatedparameters, respectively, and ε is the average sum-of-square residual ( SSR ) errors. To find out an optimum order, one should examine a wide range of orders and choose the orderStudies conducted by Li et al. showed good results in gearbox fault detection.\nCWT produces a two-dimensional set of coefficients from the analyzed signal. Although the Fourier transforms typically use sine waves as the basis for decomposition, other functionscan be selected for the wavelet shape due to signal properties. Two parameters define wavelet analysis: scale and translation. The CWT ( T ) of the signal x ( t ) is determined aswhere a and b are the scale and translation parameters, and ψ [∗] is the complex conjugate of the mother wavelet T that involves a continuous function in both time and frequency domains.\nAfter the implementation of a CWT on the evaluated signals, a PCA is performed\nfollowed by the extraction of four statistical parameters, resulting in significant data compression . Based on the p -by- q matrix X containing the extracted CWT features from the original signal evaluated by each sensor, where p is the measurement points number and q is the wavelets coefficients number, the principal components can be determinedwhere Ss represents the scores matrix, and T is a q -by- q orthonormal linear transformation matrix. In addition, four statistical parameters are extracted from the scores, Ss, including the root mean square (RMS), standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. Thus, a matrix p -by- q is transformed into a k -by- q matrix, where k equals 4. Consequently, a total of k × qenvironmental and operational variations (EOVs). For example, in damage detection, itare mostly sensitive to damage . Therefore, implementing a latent variable method,\nnamely the PCA, may efficiently reduce EOVs influences, without requiring the direct measurement of those effects. According to Bro and Smilde , PCA is a powerful and versatile method capable of providing an overview of complex multivariate data. PCA can be used to find and quantify patterns, generate new hypotheses, detect outliers, or find\nBy considering a m -by- f matrix X, taking into account features extracted from the dynamic responses, where m represents the train passages and f represents the number of\nfeatures extracted from sensors (i.e., k × q ), a transformation to another set of f features, Ss,\nis obtained by considering Equation (4). Considering the baseline condition, the covariance matrix ( C ) of the features is related to the covariance matrix of the scores Λ, as follows:where, Λ and T are matrices calculated by the singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix C . The columns of T are the eigenvectors and the diagonal matrix Λ, including\nthe eigenvalues of the matrix C in descending order. Thus, the eigenvalues stored in Λ areIt is possible to divide matrix Λ into two matrices with the first n eigenvalues and the remaining f-n eigenvalues.

Once n\nhas been selected, Equation (4) can be used to calculate the f-n components of matrix S. The transformation matrix T [ˆ] is constructed by the remaining f-n columns of matrix T . Using\nthe following function, the f-n components can be remapped to the main space:where, FPCA is m -by- f matrix of PCA features which is less sensitive to EOVs. Every sensorindex definition, is easy to implement and fast to process . For each simulation, the MD is considered to calculate a damage index (DI). Several damage identification studies haveDI . The MD is a well-known distance metric because it measures the distance\nbetween two points in a feature space containing two or more variables . Furthermore,\nit considers correlations between variables and does not depend on the scale of the features.\nIt can merge features from multiple sensors by performing data fusion. Mahalanobis\ndistance (namely here as DI ) is calculated by the following function:in which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−] , and is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The covariance matrix and mean vector intend to incorporate the baseline simulation. Based on the data derived from the\ndamaged system, a new observation would be far from the average of normal conditions.\nMahalanobis distances are calculated for each sensor and simulation. A matrix containing m Mahalanobis distances for i sensors is obtained from the above calculations.To automatically monitor train wheel conditions, the methodology performs outlier analysis.

A periodic radial\ntread irregularity around the wheel circumference characterizes the wheel polygonization.\nAccording to Peng , for wheel polygonization, the irregularity amplitudes should be higher than 0. mm. Inherent to polygonization, some parameters can geometrically characterize the phenomenon, such as the varying wavelengths (λ) in the function of the harmonic order (θ)Two groups of polygonal wheel profiles are generated for the numerical simulations,\none for undamaged scenarios and another for damaged scenarios, based on real wheel measurements, the irregularity amplitude spectra of which are presented in Figure 6.**Figure 6.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) ( **a** ) initial polygonalFor the first group of profiles, the measurement data obtained by Johansson et al.\nfor new wheels with wavelengths comprising 20 harmonics were used .

Therefore, the ARX models’ input and output orders are set to 40, and a total of 80 features are extracted. The\nsensor installed at position 5 ( yj in Equation (1)) is used as output, while each of the otherof the features extracted by the ARX models is higher than the CWT method. Figure 13a(damaged scenarios) and more by EOVs (baseline scenarios). Aside from this, the figureand irregularities. In Figure 13b,c, a comparison of baseline and damaged scenarios shows similar variations in amplitude. In Figure 13d, the amplitude variation between healthy\nand damaged scenarios is evident, as the amplitude does not change much for the first\n143 passages, and then increases, which may indicate a wheel defect. Overall, the presenceregardless of the technique applied. Thus, the feature normalization step is implemented**Figure 13.** Feature extraction for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–feature 3, ( **b** ) ARX–feature 36, ( **c** ) CWT–featureout to obtain indicators that are more sensitive to damage and less sensitive to EOVs. The Latent Variable Method PCA is applied for data normalization. As explained in Section 5.1,\nfor all 173 train passages, 3-dimensional CWT-double-PCA-based feature matrices of\n173 × 468 are calculated for each sensor. At the same time, the ARX model is implementedsensor. Note that the PCA matrices have the same dimensions as the feature extraction step In Figure 14, the same four features shown in Figure 13 for sensor 1 are shown after\nimplementing PCA for all undamaged and damaged scenarios. During the modeling process, components with a cumulative percentage of variances higher than 80% are discarded. Therefore, the number of discarded rows is seventeen and two for CWT-doublePCA-based and ARX-PCA-based methods, respectively. The results obtained are quite\ndifferent depending on the method applied as a feature extractor. A reduction in theobserved in Figure 14a,b. However, CWT-double-PCA-based parameters in Figure 14c,d,\nshow a more effective normalization of the baseline features. Overall, both methods reduce**Figure 14.** Feature normalization for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based feature 3, ( **b** ) ARX–PCA–based\nfeature 36, ( **c** ) CWT–double–PCA-based feature 140, ( **d** ) CWT–double–PCA–based feature 266.To merge all the data obtained from the ARX and CWT methods, the Mahalanobis distance is implemented by applying a two-stage fusion process: in the first step, the\nfeatures from each sensor are merged and, in the second stage, the multi-sensor information is fused to enhance the sensibility to the damage. Therefore, in the first stage, Mahalanobis\ndistance transfers 468 CWT-double-PCA-based parameters into one column (173 × 1) for each sensor and train passage. At the same time, 80 ARX-PCA-based parameters are\nconverted to a single damage-sensitive feature (173 × 1). Figure 15 demonstrates theARX-PCA and CWT-double-PCA considering sensor 1. It is possible to observe that this process significantly improves damage detection sensitivity for both approaches.**Figure 15.** Features fusion for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based, ( **b** ) CWT–double–PCA–based.Afterwards, in the second stage, all sensor information is merged to improve the sensitivity to the damage even more.

With the application of these intelligent techniques, it\nis not intended to completely replace the visual inspections already used for many decades,\nbut rather, the creation of a compatible procedure. Traditional visual inspection and control techniques are expensive, occur at intervals, and are prone to errors, it is important to\nmotivate the widespread use of Structural Integrity Monitoring (SIE) systems, especially in\nrecent infrastructures or in systems of high value to society, as in the case of railway systems . Thus, it is essential to develop automatic methodologies for detecting different Despite the widespread research on railway defect detection, to the knowledge of the authors, the reported literature on automatic wheel polygonization identification has been limited so far. Therefore, taking advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies, it isan early stage. The detection of polygonized wheels is largely carried out using accelerometers mounted on the vehicle.

On the other hand, to overcome some unpredictable oscillations in the measured responses and consequent failures in damage detection, some options can be taken.\nIn more complex structures, such as bridges and viaducts, there should be a greater susceptibility to damage when compared to areas of track sections on the foundation ground.

Moreover, ai, bk, ma, and mb are the parameters and the orders of the output and Initially, it is difficult to determine the most appropriate ARX model order. The key issue is that higher-order models could better match the data, but they may not generalize\nto other datasets. Otherwise, a low-order model is unlikely to capture the underlying physical system response. Several authors have noted the difficulty of defining a unique order for ARX models. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is reported to be one of the most effective optimization techniques . Based on the exchange between fit accuracy and the number of estimated parameters, AIC measures the goodness-of-fit of an estimatedparameters, respectively, and ε is the average sum-of-square residual ( SSR ) errors. To find out an optimum order, one should examine a wide range of orders and choose the orderStudies conducted by Li et al. showed good results in gearbox fault detection.\nCWT produces a two-dimensional set of coefficients from the analyzed signal. Although the Fourier transforms typically use sine waves as the basis for decomposition, other functionscan be selected for the wavelet shape due to signal properties. Two parameters define wavelet analysis: scale and translation. The CWT ( T ) of the signal x ( t ) is determined aswhere a and b are the scale and translation parameters, and ψ [∗] is the complex conjugate of the mother wavelet T that involves a continuous function in both time and frequency domains.\nAfter the implementation of a CWT on the evaluated signals, a PCA is performed\nfollowed by the extraction of four statistical parameters, resulting in significant data compression . Based on the p -by- q matrix X containing the extracted CWT features from the original signal evaluated by each sensor, where p is the measurement points number and q is the wavelets coefficients number, the principal components can be determinedwhere Ss represents the scores matrix, and T is a q -by- q orthonormal linear transformation matrix. In addition, four statistical parameters are extracted from the scores, Ss, including the root mean square (RMS), standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. Thus, a matrix p -by- q is transformed into a k -by- q matrix, where k equals 4. Consequently, a total of k × qenvironmental and operational variations (EOVs). For example, in damage detection, itare mostly sensitive to damage . Therefore, implementing a latent variable method,\nnamely the PCA, may efficiently reduce EOVs influences, without requiring the direct measurement of those effects. According to Bro and Smilde , PCA is a powerful and versatile method capable of providing an overview of complex multivariate data. PCA can be used to find and quantify patterns, generate new hypotheses, detect outliers, or find\nBy considering a m -by- f matrix X, taking into account features extracted from the dynamic responses, where m represents the train passages and f represents the number of\nfeatures extracted from sensors (i.e., k × q ), a transformation to another set of f features, Ss,\nis obtained by considering Equation (4). Considering the baseline condition, the covariance matrix ( C ) of the features is related to the covariance matrix of the scores Λ, as follows:where, Λ and T are matrices calculated by the singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix C . The columns of T are the eigenvectors and the diagonal matrix Λ, including\nthe eigenvalues of the matrix C in descending order. Thus, the eigenvalues stored in Λ areIt is possible to divide matrix Λ into two matrices with the first n eigenvalues and the remaining f-n eigenvalues. Determining the number of n -components is one of the\nchallenges in multivariate data interpretation. In this research study, n -components are\ndiscarded when the cumulative percentage of variance reaches 80% . Once n\nhas been selected, Equation (4) can be used to calculate the f-n components of matrix S. The transformation matrix T [ˆ] is constructed by the remaining f-n columns of matrix T . Using\nthe following function, the f-n components can be remapped to the main space:where, FPCA is m -by- f matrix of PCA features which is less sensitive to EOVs. Every sensorindex definition, is easy to implement and fast to process . For each simulation, the MD is considered to calculate a damage index (DI). Several damage identification studies haveDI . The MD is a well-known distance metric because it measures the distance\nbetween two points in a feature space containing two or more variables . Furthermore,\nit considers correlations between variables and does not depend on the scale of the features.\nIt can merge features from multiple sensors by performing data fusion. Mahalanobis\ndistance (namely here as DI ) is calculated by the following function:in which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−] , and is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The covariance matrix and mean vector intend to incorporate the baseline simulation. Based on the data derived from the\ndamaged system, a new observation would be far from the average of normal conditions.\nMahalanobis distances are calculated for each sensor and simulation. A matrix containing m Mahalanobis distances for i sensors is obtained from the above calculations.To automatically monitor train wheel conditions, the methodology performs outlier analysis.

Therefore,In real conditions, the wheels are not entirely smooth and have imperfections. Despite\ntheir small size, these out-of-roundness irregularities can cause extreme variations in the wheelrail contact forces, producing vibrations on the train and track components. A periodic radial\ntread irregularity around the wheel circumference characterizes the wheel polygonization.\nAccording to Peng , for wheel polygonization, the irregularity amplitudes should be higher than 0. mm. Inherent to polygonization, some parameters can geometrically characterize the phenomenon, such as the varying wavelengths (λ) in the function of the harmonic order (θ)Two groups of polygonal wheel profiles are generated for the numerical simulations,\none for undamaged scenarios and another for damaged scenarios, based on real wheel measurements, the irregularity amplitude spectra of which are presented in Figure 6.**Figure 6.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) ( **a** ) initial polygonalFor the first group of profiles, the measurement data obtained by Johansson et al.\nfor new wheels with wavelengths comprising 20 harmonics were used .

The wheel irregularity level ( Lw ) values are selected based on the\nirregularity spectrums of Figure 6, for both cases: initial polygonization or polygonal damage . Considering phase angles ( ψθ ) to the sine functions that are uniformly and randomly distributed between 0 and 2π, several wheel irregularities are In the case of polygonal damage, simulating different amplitudes are applied atobtain two different damage severities in the function of amplitude ranges, one between\n0. mm and 0. mm (a1) and the other between 0. mm and 1. mm (a2).

A graphical representation of the numerical model is shown in Figure 9. Note that the first wheel of the first wagon on the right side isA series of accelerometers are mounted along the track to detect a polygonized wheel.\nAccording to the results demonstrated in Mosleh et al. , the location of the most promising sensors for obtaining good results is on the rail. However, the possibility of placing the sensors on the sleepers was also analyzed, since their installation is much easier. Using a virtual wayside monitoring system, acceleration measurements were\nevaluated from 16 positions, as shown in Figure 10. In this figure, the numbers 1-to-4 andsleepers on the right and left sides, respectively, while the accelerations over the sleepers are measured by sensors located on positions 9-to-12 and 13-to-16.

Once validated,Based on several speeds, loading schemes, and unevenness profiles of the rail, Table 3\nsummarizes the simulations of the undamaged and damaged scenarios. Baseline scenariosconsider vehicle speeds between 40 and 120 km/h, and four unevenness profiles are considered for rail irregularities . A total of six types of loading schemes are\nconsidered: (i) a fully loaded train, (ii) a half-loaded train, (iii) an empty train, and trains with an unbalanced load in the transversal and longitudinal directions, namely (iv) UNB1,\n(v) UNB2, and (vi) UNB3. In accordance with UIC loading guidelines , differentgravity is longitudinally and transversally offset. For baseline scenarios, 113 simulationswheels with initial polygonal profiles. Therefore, in addition to 113 analyses with healthy wheels, 30 scenarios are considered with three semi-imperfection cases, including: (i) the right wheel on the front wheelset of the first wagon, (ii) the left wheel of the rear wheelset of the third wagon; (iii) the right wheel of the rear wheelset of the fifth wagon.

This figure illustrates the similarity between the measured accelerations\nin each case due to the similar amplitude of healthy and semi-imperfection wheels.\nAcceleration time series at position 1 for damaged wheels are presented in Figure 11b,\nconsidering two different amplitudes of wheel irregularity profiles. By comparing the results from Figure 11a,b, it is evident that the acceleration variation for the healthy wheel\nis between − 1. to 2. m/s , while the defective one changes between − 70 to 100 m/s .**Figure 11.** Acceleration time-series on position 1 for ( **a** ) healthy wheel and wheel with semiimperfection profile, ( **b** ) damaged wheel.As the first step in the automatic damage detection method, damage-sensitive features are extracted from dynamic responses. As mentioned in Section 2.1, the ARX and CWT\nmodels are implemented and their performances as feature extractors are compared.\nTo establish a suitable ARX model order, AIC values are ascendingly ranked from\n1 to 70. An average AIC function is presented in Figure 12 based on 113 baseline analyses.\nIt is evident from this figure that after model order 40, the AIC values tend to stabilize,\nshowing that higher orders do not provide additional information. Therefore, the ARX models’ input and output orders are set to 40, and a total of 80 features are extracted. The\nsensor installed at position 5 ( yj in Equation (1)) is used as output, while each of the otherof the features extracted by the ARX models is higher than the CWT method.

In Figure 13b,c, a comparison of baseline and damaged scenarios shows similar variations in amplitude. In Figure 13d, the amplitude variation between healthy\nand damaged scenarios is evident, as the amplitude does not change much for the first\n143 passages, and then increases, which may indicate a wheel defect. Overall, the presenceregardless of the technique applied. Thus, the feature normalization step is implemented**Figure 13.** Feature extraction for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–feature 3, ( **b** ) ARX–feature 36, ( **c** ) CWT–featureout to obtain indicators that are more sensitive to damage and less sensitive to EOVs. The Latent Variable Method PCA is applied for data normalization. As explained in Section 5.1,\nfor all 173 train passages, 3-dimensional CWT-double-PCA-based feature matrices of\n173 × 468 are calculated for each sensor. At the same time, the ARX model is implementedsensor. Note that the PCA matrices have the same dimensions as the feature extraction step In Figure 14, the same four features shown in Figure 13 for sensor 1 are shown after\nimplementing PCA for all undamaged and damaged scenarios. During the modeling process, components with a cumulative percentage of variances higher than 80% are discarded. Therefore, the number of discarded rows is seventeen and two for CWT-doublePCA-based and ARX-PCA-based methods, respectively. The results obtained are quite\ndifferent depending on the method applied as a feature extractor. A reduction in theobserved in Figure 14a,b. However, CWT-double-PCA-based parameters in Figure 14c,d,\nshow a more effective normalization of the baseline features. Overall, both methods reduce**Figure 14.** Feature normalization for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based feature 3, ( **b** ) ARX–PCA–based\nfeature 36, ( **c** ) CWT–double–PCA-based feature 140, ( **d** ) CWT–double–PCA–based feature 266.To merge all the data obtained from the ARX and CWT methods, the Mahalanobis distance is implemented by applying a two-stage fusion process: in the first step, the\nfeatures from each sensor are merged and, in the second stage, the multi-sensor information is fused to enhance the sensibility to the damage. Therefore, in the first stage, Mahalanobis\ndistance transfers 468 CWT-double-PCA-based parameters into one column (173 × 1) for each sensor and train passage. At the same time, 80 ARX-PCA-based parameters are\nconverted to a single damage-sensitive feature (173 × 1). Figure 15 demonstrates theARX-PCA and CWT-double-PCA considering sensor 1. It is possible to observe that this process significantly improves damage detection sensitivity for both approaches.**Figure 15.** Features fusion for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based, ( **b** ) CWT–double–PCA–based.Afterwards, in the second stage, all sensor information is merged to improve the sensitivity to the damage even more.

Therefore, it is possible to conclude that using ARX models as feature extractors**Figure 17.** Automatic wheel defect detection ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based ( **b** ) CWT–double–PCA–based.To reduce the time of installation and maintenance costs, it is necessary to obtain an\noptimal number of sensors, as well as a suitable location to install them without compromising the quality of the detection. As a result, a parametric study is carried out using\naccelerometers at distinct locations. In this analysis, only CWT is used for feature extraction because, as shown in Figure 17b, it is the best technique (with no false positives) compared(as presented in Figure 10) in terms of the total number (two, four, and six) are analyzed and the effectiveness of the detection methodology is demonstrated in Figure 18.

Thus, it is essential to develop automatic methodologies for detecting different Despite the widespread research on railway defect detection, to the knowledge of the authors, the reported literature on automatic wheel polygonization identification has been limited so far. Therefore, taking advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies, it isan early stage. The detection of polygonized wheels is largely carried out using accelerometers mounted on the vehicle.

Moreover, ai, bk, ma, and mb are the parameters and the orders of the output and Initially, it is difficult to determine the most appropriate ARX model order. The key issue is that higher-order models could better match the data, but they may not generalize\nto other datasets. Otherwise, a low-order model is unlikely to capture the underlying physical system response. Several authors have noted the difficulty of defining a unique order for ARX models. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is reported to be one of the most effective optimization techniques . Based on the exchange between fit accuracy and the number of estimated parameters, AIC measures the goodness-of-fit of an estimatedparameters, respectively, and ε is the average sum-of-square residual ( SSR ) errors. To find out an optimum order, one should examine a wide range of orders and choose the orderStudies conducted by Li et al. showed good results in gearbox fault detection.\nCWT produces a two-dimensional set of coefficients from the analyzed signal. Although the Fourier transforms typically use sine waves as the basis for decomposition, other functionscan be selected for the wavelet shape due to signal properties. Two parameters define wavelet analysis: scale and translation. The CWT ( T ) of the signal x ( t ) is determined aswhere a and b are the scale and translation parameters, and ψ [∗] is the complex conjugate of the mother wavelet T that involves a continuous function in both time and frequency domains.\nAfter the implementation of a CWT on the evaluated signals, a PCA is performed\nfollowed by the extraction of four statistical parameters, resulting in significant data compression . Based on the p -by- q matrix X containing the extracted CWT features from the original signal evaluated by each sensor, where p is the measurement points number and q is the wavelets coefficients number, the principal components can be determinedwhere Ss represents the scores matrix, and T is a q -by- q orthonormal linear transformation matrix. In addition, four statistical parameters are extracted from the scores, Ss, including the root mean square (RMS), standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. Thus, a matrix p -by- q is transformed into a k -by- q matrix, where k equals 4. Consequently, a total of k × qenvironmental and operational variations (EOVs). For example, in damage detection, itare mostly sensitive to damage . Therefore, implementing a latent variable method,\nnamely the PCA, may efficiently reduce EOVs influences, without requiring the direct measurement of those effects.

Considering the baseline condition, the covariance matrix ( C ) of the features is related to the covariance matrix of the scores Λ, as follows:where, Λ and T are matrices calculated by the singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix C . The columns of T are the eigenvectors and the diagonal matrix Λ, including\nthe eigenvalues of the matrix C in descending order. Thus, the eigenvalues stored in Λ areIt is possible to divide matrix Λ into two matrices with the first n eigenvalues and the remaining f-n eigenvalues. Determining the number of n -components is one of the\nchallenges in multivariate data interpretation. In this research study, n -components are\ndiscarded when the cumulative percentage of variance reaches 80% . Once n\nhas been selected, Equation (4) can be used to calculate the f-n components of matrix S. The transformation matrix T [ˆ] is constructed by the remaining f-n columns of matrix T . Using\nthe following function, the f-n components can be remapped to the main space:where, FPCA is m -by- f matrix of PCA features which is less sensitive to EOVs. Every sensorindex definition, is easy to implement and fast to process . For each simulation, the MD is considered to calculate a damage index (DI). Several damage identification studies haveDI . The MD is a well-known distance metric because it measures the distance\nbetween two points in a feature space containing two or more variables . Furthermore,\nit considers correlations between variables and does not depend on the scale of the features.\nIt can merge features from multiple sensors by performing data fusion. Mahalanobis\ndistance (namely here as DI ) is calculated by the following function:in which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−] , and is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The covariance matrix and mean vector intend to incorporate the baseline simulation. Based on the data derived from the\ndamaged system, a new observation would be far from the average of normal conditions.\nMahalanobis distances are calculated for each sensor and simulation. A matrix containing m Mahalanobis distances for i sensors is obtained from the above calculations.To automatically monitor train wheel conditions, the methodology performs outlier analysis. In Meixedo et al. and Mosleh et al. , this tool proved to be very efficient in\nclassifying the data as being related to a scenario with or without damage. Mahalanobisspace. A Gaussian distribution can be used to approximate the Mahalanobis distance, and statistical thresholds can be used to analyze outliers. By considering a mean value and standard deviation σ of the baseline feature vector, as well as the significance level α, itconsequently, when DI is equal to or higher than CB, a feature is considered to be an outlier.In the present research, the Laagrss freight train composed of five wagons is studied.\nAccording to the UIC classification, it can reach a top speed of 120 km/h . Each wagon has a tare weight of 27 t and can carry loads up to 52 t. A double freight wagon is shown incomponent. A rigid beam element was also used to connect the above-mentioned components. The numerical model of the vehicle is presented in Figure 3 and the mechanicaland geometric properties of the vehicle are detailed in Table 1. More details regarding the\nnumerical model of the freight wagons are provided by Bragança et al. .program, developed by Montenegro et al. . The model is based on a multi-layer scheme,\nsimulating the ballast, sleepers, and rails, as shown in Figure 4. The railpads, resting on the sleepers under the rail, are simulated as spring elements connecting the sleepers and\nrail. The mass of the ballast is represented by elements of discrete mass points, while the\nrails and sleepers are modeled using beam elements, adopting the appropriate material properties for each one. Finally, spring-dashpot elements are also incorporated to consider\nfoundation flexibility. Table 2 presents the properties of the track model.ties are very small, their effects on wheel-rail contact cannot be neglected . Therefore,In real conditions, the wheels are not entirely smooth and have imperfections. Despite\ntheir small size, these out-of-roundness irregularities can cause extreme variations in the wheelrail contact forces, producing vibrations on the train and track components. A periodic radial\ntread irregularity around the wheel circumference characterizes the wheel polygonization.\nAccording to Peng , for wheel polygonization, the irregularity amplitudes should be higher than 0. mm. Inherent to polygonization, some parameters can geometrically characterize the phenomenon, such as the varying wavelengths (λ) in the function of the harmonic order (θ)Two groups of polygonal wheel profiles are generated for the numerical simulations,\none for undamaged scenarios and another for damaged scenarios, based on real wheel measurements, the irregularity amplitude spectra of which are presented in Figure 6.**Figure 6.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) ( **a** ) initial polygonalFor the first group of profiles, the measurement data obtained by Johansson et al.\nfor new wheels with wavelengths comprising 20 harmonics were used . Thebetween 0.135–2. m, being the upper limit of the perimeter of the wheel. For the second group of profiles, the measurement values for four wheels with polygonal damage obtained\nby Cai et al. were considered . The wheel pr i s are characterized by the\nwavelengths in the first 30 harmonics, with the 6th to 8th harmonic orders being dominant.\nThen, different irregularity wheel profiles are generated based on the sum of sine### w ( xw ) = ∑ Aθ sin [ψ] [θ]where Aθ is the amplitude of the sine function for each wavelength, which is calculated bywhere, as wre f = 1 µm. The wheel irregularity level ( Lw ) values are selected based on the\nirregularity spectrums of Figure 6, for both cases: initial polygonization or polygonal damage . Considering phase angles ( ψθ ) to the sine functions that are uniformly and randomly distributed between 0 and 2π, several wheel irregularities are In the case of polygonal damage, simulating different amplitudes are applied atobtain two different damage severities in the function of amplitude ranges, one between\n0. mm and 0. mm (a1) and the other between 0. mm and 1. mm (a2).

By observing these two figures, the difference inaround 0. mm and a damaged polygonal wheel with amplitudes between 0. mm and**Figure 7.** Example of an initial polygonization profile based on Figure 6a irregularity spectrum.**Figure 8.** Examples of polygonization-damaged profiles based on Figure 6b irregularity spectrumusing the in-house software VSI—Vehicle-Structure Interaction Analysis, which was validated and described in detail in the authors’ previous publication and was used in various of applications . In this model, the train is coupled to the track using a 3D wheel-rail contact model, using Hertzian theory to calculate the normal contact forces andsoftware. It is important to note that both subsystems are initially separately modeled in\nmodels via a fully coupled approach . The full explanation of the properties of\ntrack and train, including more details regarding train-track interaction, can be found in the authors’ previous publications . A graphical representation of the numerical model is shown in Figure 9. Note that the first wheel of the first wagon on the right side isA series of accelerometers are mounted along the track to detect a polygonized wheel.\nAccording to the results demonstrated in Mosleh et al. , the location of the most promising sensors for obtaining good results is on the rail. However, the possibility of placing the sensors on the sleepers was also analyzed, since their installation is much easier. Using a virtual wayside monitoring system, acceleration measurements were\nevaluated from 16 positions, as shown in Figure 10. In this figure, the numbers 1-to-4 andsleepers on the right and left sides, respectively, while the accelerations over the sleepers are measured by sensors located on positions 9-to-12 and 13-to-16.

Once validated,Based on several speeds, loading schemes, and unevenness profiles of the rail, Table 3\nsummarizes the simulations of the undamaged and damaged scenarios. Baseline scenariosconsider vehicle speeds between 40 and 120 km/h, and four unevenness profiles are considered for rail irregularities . A total of six types of loading schemes are\nconsidered: (i) a fully loaded train, (ii) a half-loaded train, (iii) an empty train, and trains with an unbalanced load in the transversal and longitudinal directions, namely (iv) UNB1,\n(v) UNB2, and (vi) UNB3. In accordance with UIC loading guidelines , differentgravity is longitudinally and transversally offset. For baseline scenarios, 113 simulationswheels with initial polygonal profiles. Therefore, in addition to 113 analyses with healthy wheels, 30 scenarios are considered with three semi-imperfection cases, including: (i) the right wheel on the front wheelset of the first wagon, (ii) the left wheel of the rear wheelset of the third wagon; (iii) the right wheel of the rear wheelset of the fifth wagon. Furthermore,the front wheel on the right side of the first wagon as a polygonized wheel. These scenarioslow-pass Chebyshev type II digital filter.

The wheel with a semi-imperfection profile is located on the first wheel of the first wagon. This figure illustrates the similarity between the measured accelerations\nin each case due to the similar amplitude of healthy and semi-imperfection wheels.\nAcceleration time series at position 1 for damaged wheels are presented in Figure 11b,\nconsidering two different amplitudes of wheel irregularity profiles. By comparing the results from Figure 11a,b, it is evident that the acceleration variation for the healthy wheel\nis between − 1. to 2. m/s , while the defective one changes between − 70 to 100 m/s .**Figure 11.** Acceleration time-series on position 1 for ( **a** ) healthy wheel and wheel with semiimperfection profile, ( **b** ) damaged wheel.As the first step in the automatic damage detection method, damage-sensitive features are extracted from dynamic responses. As mentioned in Section 2.1, the ARX and CWT\nmodels are implemented and their performances as feature extractors are compared.\nTo establish a suitable ARX model order, AIC values are ascendingly ranked from\n1 to 70. An average AIC function is presented in Figure 12 based on 113 baseline analyses.\nIt is evident from this figure that after model order 40, the AIC values tend to stabilize,\nshowing that higher orders do not provide additional information. Therefore, the ARX models’ input and output orders are set to 40, and a total of 80 features are extracted. The\nsensor installed at position 5 ( yj in Equation (1)) is used as output, while each of the otherof the features extracted by the ARX models is higher than the CWT method.

In Figure 13b,c, a comparison of baseline and damaged scenarios shows similar variations in amplitude. In Figure 13d, the amplitude variation between healthy\nand damaged scenarios is evident, as the amplitude does not change much for the first\n143 passages, and then increases, which may indicate a wheel defect. Overall, the presenceregardless of the technique applied. Thus, the feature normalization step is implemented**Figure 13.** Feature extraction for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–feature 3, ( **b** ) ARX–feature 36, ( **c** ) CWT–featureout to obtain indicators that are more sensitive to damage and less sensitive to EOVs. The Latent Variable Method PCA is applied for data normalization. As explained in Section 5.1,\nfor all 173 train passages, 3-dimensional CWT-double-PCA-based feature matrices of\n173 × 468 are calculated for each sensor. At the same time, the ARX model is implementedsensor. Note that the PCA matrices have the same dimensions as the feature extraction step In Figure 14, the same four features shown in Figure 13 for sensor 1 are shown after\nimplementing PCA for all undamaged and damaged scenarios. During the modeling process, components with a cumulative percentage of variances higher than 80% are discarded. Therefore, the number of discarded rows is seventeen and two for CWT-doublePCA-based and ARX-PCA-based methods, respectively. The results obtained are quite\ndifferent depending on the method applied as a feature extractor. A reduction in theobserved in Figure 14a,b. However, CWT-double-PCA-based parameters in Figure 14c,d,\nshow a more effective normalization of the baseline features. Overall, both methods reduce**Figure 14.** Feature normalization for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based feature 3, ( **b** ) ARX–PCA–based\nfeature 36, ( **c** ) CWT–double–PCA-based feature 140, ( **d** ) CWT–double–PCA–based feature 266.To merge all the data obtained from the ARX and CWT methods, the Mahalanobis distance is implemented by applying a two-stage fusion process: in the first step, the\nfeatures from each sensor are merged and, in the second stage, the multi-sensor information is fused to enhance the sensibility to the damage. Therefore, in the first stage, Mahalanobis\ndistance transfers 468 CWT-double-PCA-based parameters into one column (173 × 1) for each sensor and train passage. At the same time, 80 ARX-PCA-based parameters are\nconverted to a single damage-sensitive feature (173 × 1). Figure 15 demonstrates theARX-PCA and CWT-double-PCA considering sensor 1. It is possible to observe that this process significantly improves damage detection sensitivity for both approaches.**Figure 15.** Features fusion for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based, ( **b** ) CWT–double–PCA–based.Afterwards, in the second stage, all sensor information is merged to improve the sensitivity to the damage even more.

It significantly increases the possibility of effective automatic**Figure 16.** Sensors fusion, ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based, ( **b** ) CWT–double–PCA–based.Despite the visual distinction between healthy and damaged wheels using data processing discussed above, strategies for unsupervised wayside monitoring should employhealthy states . Moreover, comparing the ARX and CWT methods is consideredthe most reliable results. The last step of the polygonized wheel detection technique is tofunction. The significance level of the threshold is defined as 1%, as it has been commonly(173 passages), Figure 17 illustrates the effectiveness of the proposed methodology for distinguishing undamaged from damaged scenarios.

Therefore, it is possible to conclude that using ARX models as feature extractors**Figure 17.** Automatic wheel defect detection ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based ( **b** ) CWT–double–PCA–based.To reduce the time of installation and maintenance costs, it is necessary to obtain an\noptimal number of sensors, as well as a suitable location to install them without compromising the quality of the detection. As a result, a parametric study is carried out using\naccelerometers at distinct locations. In this analysis, only CWT is used for feature extraction because, as shown in Figure 17b, it is the best technique (with no false positives) compared(as presented in Figure 10) in terms of the total number (two, four, and six) are analyzed and the effectiveness of the detection methodology is demonstrated in Figure 18. The results concluded that even with two sensors (one on each side of the rail), the proposed**Figure 18.** Automatic polygonized wheel detection based on CWT technique considering: ( **a** ) sixIn the previous section, the proposed approach to detect a defective wheel from a healthy one was implemented for accelerometers located on the rail.

Thus, it is essential to develop automatic methodologies for detecting different Despite the widespread research on railway defect detection, to the knowledge of the authors, the reported literature on automatic wheel polygonization identification has been limited so far. Therefore, taking advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies, it isan early stage. The detection of polygonized wheels is largely carried out using accelerometers mounted on the vehicle.

The validation of the proposed AI-based methodology herein, considering a polygonal wheel, is a clear step forward\nin terms of the proposed methodology’s effectiveness, allowing for a complete implementation**2.

By using the Mahalanobis distance, the features from each sensor can be effectively merged in the first stage. Moreover, a new Mahalanobis distance is applied\nagain in the second stage to integrate all sensor information. The outcome of this stepDI identifies a healthy or a defective wheel; a statistical confidence boundary (CB) isIn this study, the features are extracted based on autoregressive models with exogenous inputs (ARX) and continuous wavelet transform (CWT) models. The performance ofthe occurrence of gearbox failures. The ARX autoregressive model considers the predictive behavior of the system at a specific location, considering its history at the same\npoint and the predictive response at other measurement locations, being defined by the### xj = ∑ aixj−i +### ∑ bkyj−k + ε j (1)where xj, yj, and ε j are the output, input, as well as error term of the model at the signal value j . Moreover, ai, bk, ma, and mb are the parameters and the orders of the output and Initially, it is difficult to determine the most appropriate ARX model order. The key issue is that higher-order models could better match the data, but they may not generalize\nto other datasets. Otherwise, a low-order model is unlikely to capture the underlying physical system response. Several authors have noted the difficulty of defining a unique order for ARX models. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is reported to be one of the most effective optimization techniques . Based on the exchange between fit accuracy and the number of estimated parameters, AIC measures the goodness-of-fit of an estimatedparameters, respectively, and ε is the average sum-of-square residual ( SSR ) errors. To find out an optimum order, one should examine a wide range of orders and choose the orderStudies conducted by Li et al. showed good results in gearbox fault detection.\nCWT produces a two-dimensional set of coefficients from the analyzed signal. Although the Fourier transforms typically use sine waves as the basis for decomposition, other functionscan be selected for the wavelet shape due to signal properties. Two parameters define wavelet analysis: scale and translation. The CWT ( T ) of the signal x ( t ) is determined aswhere a and b are the scale and translation parameters, and ψ [∗] is the complex conjugate of the mother wavelet T that involves a continuous function in both time and frequency domains.\nAfter the implementation of a CWT on the evaluated signals, a PCA is performed\nfollowed by the extraction of four statistical parameters, resulting in significant data compression . Based on the p -by- q matrix X containing the extracted CWT features from the original signal evaluated by each sensor, where p is the measurement points number and q is the wavelets coefficients number, the principal components can be determinedwhere Ss represents the scores matrix, and T is a q -by- q orthonormal linear transformation matrix. In addition, four statistical parameters are extracted from the scores, Ss, including the root mean square (RMS), standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. Thus, a matrix p -by- q is transformed into a k -by- q matrix, where k equals 4. Consequently, a total of k × qenvironmental and operational variations (EOVs). For example, in damage detection, itare mostly sensitive to damage . Therefore, implementing a latent variable method,\nnamely the PCA, may efficiently reduce EOVs influences, without requiring the direct measurement of those effects. According to Bro and Smilde , PCA is a powerful and versatile method capable of providing an overview of complex multivariate data. PCA can be used to find and quantify patterns, generate new hypotheses, detect outliers, or find\nBy considering a m -by- f matrix X, taking into account features extracted from the dynamic responses, where m represents the train passages and f represents the number of\nfeatures extracted from sensors (i.e., k × q ), a transformation to another set of f features, Ss,\nis obtained by considering Equation (4). Considering the baseline condition, the covariance matrix ( C ) of the features is related to the covariance matrix of the scores Λ, as follows:where, Λ and T are matrices calculated by the singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix C . The columns of T are the eigenvectors and the diagonal matrix Λ, including\nthe eigenvalues of the matrix C in descending order. Thus, the eigenvalues stored in Λ areIt is possible to divide matrix Λ into two matrices with the first n eigenvalues and the remaining f-n eigenvalues. Determining the number of n -components is one of the\nchallenges in multivariate data interpretation. In this research study, n -components are\ndiscarded when the cumulative percentage of variance reaches 80% . Once n\nhas been selected, Equation (4) can be used to calculate the f-n components of matrix S. The transformation matrix T [ˆ] is constructed by the remaining f-n columns of matrix T . Using\nthe following function, the f-n components can be remapped to the main space:where, FPCA is m -by- f matrix of PCA features which is less sensitive to EOVs. Every sensorindex definition, is easy to implement and fast to process . For each simulation, the MD is considered to calculate a damage index (DI). Several damage identification studies haveDI . The MD is a well-known distance metric because it measures the distance\nbetween two points in a feature space containing two or more variables . Furthermore,\nit considers correlations between variables and does not depend on the scale of the features.\nIt can merge features from multiple sensors by performing data fusion. Mahalanobis\ndistance (namely here as DI ) is calculated by the following function:in which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−] , and is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The covariance matrix and mean vector intend to incorporate the baseline simulation. Based on the data derived from the\ndamaged system, a new observation would be far from the average of normal conditions.\nMahalanobis distances are calculated for each sensor and simulation. A matrix containing m Mahalanobis distances for i sensors is obtained from the above calculations.To automatically monitor train wheel conditions, the methodology performs outlier analysis. In Meixedo et al. and Mosleh et al. , this tool proved to be very efficient in\nclassifying the data as being related to a scenario with or without damage. Mahalanobisspace. A Gaussian distribution can be used to approximate the Mahalanobis distance, and statistical thresholds can be used to analyze outliers. By considering a mean value and standard deviation σ of the baseline feature vector, as well as the significance level α, itconsequently, when DI is equal to or higher than CB, a feature is considered to be an outlier.In the present research, the Laagrss freight train composed of five wagons is studied.\nAccording to the UIC classification, it can reach a top speed of 120 km/h . Each wagon has a tare weight of 27 t and can carry loads up to 52 t. A double freight wagon is shown incomponent. A rigid beam element was also used to connect the above-mentioned components.

The model is based on a multi-layer scheme,\nsimulating the ballast, sleepers, and rails, as shown in Figure 4. The railpads, resting on the sleepers under the rail, are simulated as spring elements connecting the sleepers and\nrail. The mass of the ballast is represented by elements of discrete mass points, while the\nrails and sleepers are modeled using beam elements, adopting the appropriate material properties for each one.

Table 2 presents the properties of the track model.ties are very small, their effects on wheel-rail contact cannot be neglected . Therefore,In real conditions, the wheels are not entirely smooth and have imperfections. Despite\ntheir small size, these out-of-roundness irregularities can cause extreme variations in the wheelrail contact forces, producing vibrations on the train and track components. A periodic radial\ntread irregularity around the wheel circumference characterizes the wheel polygonization.\nAccording to Peng , for wheel polygonization, the irregularity amplitudes should be higher than 0. mm. Inherent to polygonization, some parameters can geometrically characterize the phenomenon, such as the varying wavelengths (λ) in the function of the harmonic order (θ)Two groups of polygonal wheel profiles are generated for the numerical simulations,\none for undamaged scenarios and another for damaged scenarios, based on real wheel measurements, the irregularity amplitude spectra of which are presented in Figure 6.**Figure 6.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) ( **a** ) initial polygonalFor the first group of profiles, the measurement data obtained by Johansson et al.\nfor new wheels with wavelengths comprising 20 harmonics were used . Thebetween 0.135–2. m, being the upper limit of the perimeter of the wheel.

The wheel pr i s are characterized by the\nwavelengths in the first 30 harmonics, with the 6th to 8th harmonic orders being dominant.\nThen, different irregularity wheel profiles are generated based on the sum of sine### w ( xw ) = ∑ Aθ sin [ψ] [θ]where Aθ is the amplitude of the sine function for each wavelength, which is calculated bywhere, as wre f = 1 µm. The wheel irregularity level ( Lw ) values are selected based on the\nirregularity spectrums of Figure 6, for both cases: initial polygonization or polygonal damage . Considering phase angles ( ψθ ) to the sine functions that are uniformly and randomly distributed between 0 and 2π, several wheel irregularities are In the case of polygonal damage, simulating different amplitudes are applied atobtain two different damage severities in the function of amplitude ranges, one between\n0. mm and 0. mm (a1) and the other between 0. mm and 1. mm (a2).

A graphical representation of the numerical model is shown in Figure 9. Note that the first wheel of the first wagon on the right side isA series of accelerometers are mounted along the track to detect a polygonized wheel.\nAccording to the results demonstrated in Mosleh et al. , the location of the most promising sensors for obtaining good results is on the rail. However, the possibility of placing the sensors on the sleepers was also analyzed, since their installation is much easier. Using a virtual wayside monitoring system, acceleration measurements were\nevaluated from 16 positions, as shown in Figure 10.

Once validated,Based on several speeds, loading schemes, and unevenness profiles of the rail, Table 3\nsummarizes the simulations of the undamaged and damaged scenarios. Baseline scenariosconsider vehicle speeds between 40 and 120 km/h, and four unevenness profiles are considered for rail irregularities . A total of six types of loading schemes are\nconsidered: (i) a fully loaded train, (ii) a half-loaded train, (iii) an empty train, and trains with an unbalanced load in the transversal and longitudinal directions, namely (iv) UNB1,\n(v) UNB2, and (vi) UNB3. In accordance with UIC loading guidelines , differentgravity is longitudinally and transversally offset. For baseline scenarios, 113 simulationswheels with initial polygonal profiles. Therefore, in addition to 113 analyses with healthy wheels, 30 scenarios are considered with three semi-imperfection cases, including: (i) the right wheel on the front wheelset of the first wagon, (ii) the left wheel of the rear wheelset of the third wagon; (iii) the right wheel of the rear wheelset of the fifth wagon.

By comparing the results from Figure 11a,b, it is evident that the acceleration variation for the healthy wheel\nis between − 1. to 2. m/s , while the defective one changes between − 70 to 100 m/s .**Figure 11.** Acceleration time-series on position 1 for ( **a** ) healthy wheel and wheel with semiimperfection profile, ( **b** ) damaged wheel.As the first step in the automatic damage detection method, damage-sensitive features are extracted from dynamic responses. As mentioned in Section 2.1, the ARX and CWT\nmodels are implemented and their performances as feature extractors are compared.\nTo establish a suitable ARX model order, AIC values are ascendingly ranked from\n1 to 70. An average AIC function is presented in Figure 12 based on 113 baseline analyses.\nIt is evident from this figure that after model order 40, the AIC values tend to stabilize,\nshowing that higher orders do not provide additional information. Therefore, the ARX models’ input and output orders are set to 40, and a total of 80 features are extracted. The\nsensor installed at position 5 ( yj in Equation (1)) is used as output, while each of the otherof the features extracted by the ARX models is higher than the CWT method.

Overall, the presenceregardless of the technique applied. Thus, the feature normalization step is implemented**Figure 13.** Feature extraction for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–feature 3, ( **b** ) ARX–feature 36, ( **c** ) CWT–featureout to obtain indicators that are more sensitive to damage and less sensitive to EOVs. The Latent Variable Method PCA is applied for data normalization.

At the same time, the ARX model is implementedsensor. Note that the PCA matrices have the same dimensions as the feature extraction step In Figure 14, the same four features shown in Figure 13 for sensor 1 are shown after\nimplementing PCA for all undamaged and damaged scenarios. During the modeling process, components with a cumulative percentage of variances higher than 80% are discarded. Therefore, the number of discarded rows is seventeen and two for CWT-doublePCA-based and ARX-PCA-based methods, respectively. The results obtained are quite\ndifferent depending on the method applied as a feature extractor. A reduction in theobserved in Figure 14a,b. However, CWT-double-PCA-based parameters in Figure 14c,d,\nshow a more effective normalization of the baseline features.

Therefore, in the first stage, Mahalanobis\ndistance transfers 468 CWT-double-PCA-based parameters into one column (173 × 1) for each sensor and train passage. At the same time, 80 ARX-PCA-based parameters are\nconverted to a single damage-sensitive feature (173 × 1). Figure 15 demonstrates theARX-PCA and CWT-double-PCA considering sensor 1. It is possible to observe that this process significantly improves damage detection sensitivity for both approaches.**Figure 15.** Features fusion for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based, ( **b** ) CWT–double–PCA–based.Afterwards, in the second stage, all sensor information is merged to improve the sensitivity to the damage even more.

As a result, a parametric study is carried out using\naccelerometers at distinct locations. In this analysis, only CWT is used for feature extraction because, as shown in Figure 17b, it is the best technique (with no false positives) compared(as presented in Figure 10) in terms of the total number (two, four, and six) are analyzed and the effectiveness of the detection methodology is demonstrated in Figure 18.

With the application of these intelligent techniques, it\nis not intended to completely replace the visual inspections already used for many decades,\nbut rather, the creation of a compatible procedure. Traditional visual inspection and control techniques are expensive, occur at intervals, and are prone to errors, it is important to\nmotivate the widespread use of Structural Integrity Monitoring (SIE) systems, especially in\nrecent infrastructures or in systems of high value to society, as in the case of railway systems . Thus, it is essential to develop automatic methodologies for detecting different Despite the widespread research on railway defect detection, to the knowledge of the authors, the reported literature on automatic wheel polygonization identification has been limited so far. Therefore, taking advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies, it isan early stage. The detection of polygonized wheels is largely carried out using accelerometers mounted on the vehicle. The parametric power spectral estimation and adaptive chirpresults, but with flaws in polygonization detection in the early stages [19–21].\nOn the other hand, previous studies have shown very good results using waysidelearning in detecting defects in railway vehicle wheels, namely wheel flat detections .\nThis type of methodology usually presents the following steps: (i) feature extractionusing data from accelerations or strains measured on the track, (ii) feature modelingand operational variations, (iii) data fusion to merge different features and/or sensors information, and (iv) features discrimination to classify the defects. The studies carriedidentifying singular irregularities on the wheel surface (i.e., wheel flat). In this context, itcomprehensive number of damages, namely the ones that may occur along the entire Several methods have been used for feature extraction, which converts time-series\ndata into more condensed information, allowing damage to be more easily observed.\nSymbolic data, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) [15–17], principal component analysis\n(PCA) , and autoregressive models [15–17] are examples of effective techniques for\nextracting damage-sensitive features for both static and dynamic monitoring. In timedomain applications where the measured quantity is acceleration, autoregressive modelson the system response, with the model parameters reflecting the properties of the system regardless of the sources of excitations. CWT and PCA have been developed over decades in different applications, in both time and frequency domains with various sensors. Despite this, they present some limitations, PCA does not consider the non-linearity of the data\nand CWT adds excess redundancy to the data, and it has a high computational cost, so For feature fusion, several algorithms, including neighborhood-preserving embedding\n(NPE) , neural networks , Mahalanobis distance , manifold learning methods , and kernel-based methods , have been recently employed. This data fusioninformation. Due to its simplicity and ability to reduce multivariate data, Mahalanobis\nRecent approaches based on machine learning have been applied for feature classification to differentiate a healthy wheel from a defective one . Typically, two different approaches are used: (i) unsupervised methods, in which models are trained using labeled data under the supervision of training data, such as k-means , self-organizing maps\n(SOM) , and cluster analysis; or (ii) supervised methods, in which models are not supervised using training datasets, such as Naive Bayes classifiers and k-Nearest Neighbor\nThis work aims: (i) to develop an unsupervised methodology to identify polygonized\nwheels; (ii) to evaluate the performance of different feature extraction techniques concerning their sensitivity to the detection of wheel polygonization, specifically those based on\nautoregressive exogenous models (ARX) and continuous wavelet transforms (CWT); (iii) towheel defect detection system. The unsupervised methodology to identify polygonized wheels consists of five phases: (i) data acquisition, (ii) feature extraction, (iii) feature The acquired track responses are influenced by parameters such as speed, irregularities, and load types. In this sense, different simulations of realistic scenarios of dynamicconditions. On the other hand, to overcome some unpredictable oscillations in the measured responses and consequent failures in damage detection, some options can be taken.\nIn more complex structures, such as bridges and viaducts, there should be a greater susceptibility to damage when compared to areas of track sections on the foundation ground. If the structures are damaged, they may camouflage or cause false warnings. In a practical context, the use of sensors in an area of the track less prone to damage and where vibrationmethodology. Aligned on these assumptions, the location of the sensors was chosen on aAfter defining the AI approach for identifying wheel polygonization, two distinguished feature extraction methods, namely ARX and CWT, are compared. To avoid\nfalse alarm situations caused by environmental and operational effects, the latent variable method Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied. To reduce the volume of extracted data while retaining the most relevant information, as well as improve the ability to characterize the measured phenomenon, the data are merged using the Mahalanobis distance. As\na final step, an outlier analysis is employed to automatically distinguish a healthy wheel It should be highlighted that wheel flat identification was developed by Mosleh et al. ,\nwho demonstrated that the methodology is able to identify wheel flats. The validation of the proposed AI-based methodology herein, considering a polygonal wheel, is a clear step forward\nin terms of the proposed methodology’s effectiveness, allowing for a complete implementation**2. Proposed Methodology for Automatic Wheel Polygonization Detection**(ii) Feature extraction from multiple sensor signals, by continuous wavelet transforms\n(CWT) or autoregressive exogenous (ARX) models, that are separately implemented,\nand their performances are compared; in this step, a time record is transformed intonot only normalizes the extracted features but also increases their sensitivity to damage.sensitivity. By using the Mahalanobis distance, the features from each sensor can be effectively merged in the first stage. Moreover, a new Mahalanobis distance is applied\nagain in the second stage to integrate all sensor information. The outcome of this stepDI identifies a healthy or a defective wheel; a statistical confidence boundary (CB) isIn this study, the features are extracted based on autoregressive models with exogenous inputs (ARX) and continuous wavelet transform (CWT) models. The performance ofthe occurrence of gearbox failures. The ARX autoregressive model considers the predictive behavior of the system at a specific location, considering its history at the same\npoint and the predictive response at other measurement locations, being defined by the### xj = ∑ aixj−i +### ∑ bkyj−k + ε j (1)where xj, yj, and ε j are the output, input, as well as error term of the model at the signal value j . Moreover, ai, bk, ma, and mb are the parameters and the orders of the output and Initially, it is difficult to determine the most appropriate ARX model order. The key issue is that higher-order models could better match the data, but they may not generalize\nto other datasets. Otherwise, a low-order model is unlikely to capture the underlying physical system response. Several authors have noted the difficulty of defining a unique order for ARX models. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is reported to be one of the most effective optimization techniques . Based on the exchange between fit accuracy and the number of estimated parameters, AIC measures the goodness-of-fit of an estimatedparameters, respectively, and ε is the average sum-of-square residual ( SSR ) errors. To find out an optimum order, one should examine a wide range of orders and choose the orderStudies conducted by Li et al. showed good results in gearbox fault detection.\nCWT produces a two-dimensional set of coefficients from the analyzed signal. Although the Fourier transforms typically use sine waves as the basis for decomposition, other functionscan be selected for the wavelet shape due to signal properties. Two parameters define wavelet analysis: scale and translation. The CWT ( T ) of the signal x ( t ) is determined aswhere a and b are the scale and translation parameters, and ψ [∗] is the complex conjugate of the mother wavelet T that involves a continuous function in both time and frequency domains.\nAfter the implementation of a CWT on the evaluated signals, a PCA is performed\nfollowed by the extraction of four statistical parameters, resulting in significant data compression . Based on the p -by- q matrix X containing the extracted CWT features from the original signal evaluated by each sensor, where p is the measurement points number and q is the wavelets coefficients number, the principal components can be determinedwhere Ss represents the scores matrix, and T is a q -by- q orthonormal linear transformation matrix. In addition, four statistical parameters are extracted from the scores, Ss, including the root mean square (RMS), standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. Thus, a matrix p -by- q is transformed into a k -by- q matrix, where k equals 4. Consequently, a total of k × qenvironmental and operational variations (EOVs). For example, in damage detection, itare mostly sensitive to damage . Therefore, implementing a latent variable method,\nnamely the PCA, may efficiently reduce EOVs influences, without requiring the direct measurement of those effects. According to Bro and Smilde , PCA is a powerful and versatile method capable of providing an overview of complex multivariate data. PCA can be used to find and quantify patterns, generate new hypotheses, detect outliers, or find\nBy considering a m -by- f matrix X, taking into account features extracted from the dynamic responses, where m represents the train passages and f represents the number of\nfeatures extracted from sensors (i.e., k × q ), a transformation to another set of f features, Ss,\nis obtained by considering Equation (4). Considering the baseline condition, the covariance matrix ( C ) of the features is related to the covariance matrix of the scores Λ, as follows:where, Λ and T are matrices calculated by the singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix C . The columns of T are the eigenvectors and the diagonal matrix Λ, including\nthe eigenvalues of the matrix C in descending order. Thus, the eigenvalues stored in Λ areIt is possible to divide matrix Λ into two matrices with the first n eigenvalues and the remaining f-n eigenvalues. Determining the number of n -components is one of the\nchallenges in multivariate data interpretation. In this research study, n -components are\ndiscarded when the cumulative percentage of variance reaches 80% . Once n\nhas been selected, Equation (4) can be used to calculate the f-n components of matrix S. The transformation matrix T [ˆ] is constructed by the remaining f-n columns of matrix T . Using\nthe following function, the f-n components can be remapped to the main space:where, FPCA is m -by- f matrix of PCA features which is less sensitive to EOVs. Every sensorindex definition, is easy to implement and fast to process . For each simulation, the MD is considered to calculate a damage index (DI). Several damage identification studies haveDI . The MD is a well-known distance metric because it measures the distance\nbetween two points in a feature space containing two or more variables . Furthermore,\nit considers correlations between variables and does not depend on the scale of the features.\nIt can merge features from multiple sensors by performing data fusion. Mahalanobis\ndistance (namely here as DI ) is calculated by the following function:in which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−] , and is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The covariance matrix and mean vector intend to incorporate the baseline simulation. Based on the data derived from the\ndamaged system, a new observation would be far from the average of normal conditions.\nMahalanobis distances are calculated for each sensor and simulation. A matrix containing m Mahalanobis distances for i sensors is obtained from the above calculations.To automatically monitor train wheel conditions, the methodology performs outlier analysis. In Meixedo et al. and Mosleh et al. , this tool proved to be very efficient in\nclassifying the data as being related to a scenario with or without damage. Mahalanobisspace. A Gaussian distribution can be used to approximate the Mahalanobis distance, and statistical thresholds can be used to analyze outliers. By considering a mean value and standard deviation σ of the baseline feature vector, as well as the significance level α, itconsequently, when DI is equal to or higher than CB, a feature is considered to be an outlier.In the present research, the Laagrss freight train composed of five wagons is studied.\nAccording to the UIC classification, it can reach a top speed of 120 km/h . Each wagon has a tare weight of 27 t and can carry loads up to 52 t. A double freight wagon is shown incomponent. A rigid beam element was also used to connect the above-mentioned components. The numerical model of the vehicle is presented in Figure 3 and the mechanicaland geometric properties of the vehicle are detailed in Table 1. More details regarding the\nnumerical model of the freight wagons are provided by Bragança et al. .program, developed by Montenegro et al. . The model is based on a multi-layer scheme,\nsimulating the ballast, sleepers, and rails, as shown in Figure 4. The railpads, resting on the sleepers under the rail, are simulated as spring elements connecting the sleepers and\nrail. The mass of the ballast is represented by elements of discrete mass points, while the\nrails and sleepers are modeled using beam elements, adopting the appropriate material properties for each one. Finally, spring-dashpot elements are also incorporated to consider\nfoundation flexibility. Table 2 presents the properties of the track model.ties are very small, their effects on wheel-rail contact cannot be neglected . Therefore,In real conditions, the wheels are not entirely smooth and have imperfections. Despite\ntheir small size, these out-of-roundness irregularities can cause extreme variations in the wheelrail contact forces, producing vibrations on the train and track components. A periodic radial\ntread irregularity around the wheel circumference characterizes the wheel polygonization.\nAccording to Peng , for wheel polygonization, the irregularity amplitudes should be higher than 0. mm. Inherent to polygonization, some parameters can geometrically characterize the phenomenon, such as the varying wavelengths (λ) in the function of the harmonic order (θ)Two groups of polygonal wheel profiles are generated for the numerical simulations,\none for undamaged scenarios and another for damaged scenarios, based on real wheel measurements, the irregularity amplitude spectra of which are presented in Figure 6.**Figure 6.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) ( **a** ) initial polygonalFor the first group of profiles, the measurement data obtained by Johansson et al.\nfor new wheels with wavelengths comprising 20 harmonics were used . Thebetween 0.135–2. m, being the upper limit of the perimeter of the wheel. For the second group of profiles, the measurement values for four wheels with polygonal damage obtained\nby Cai et al. were considered . The wheel pr i s are characterized by the\nwavelengths in the first 30 harmonics, with the 6th to 8th harmonic orders being dominant.\nThen, different irregularity wheel profiles are generated based on the sum of sine### w ( xw ) = ∑ Aθ sin [ψ] [θ]where Aθ is the amplitude of the sine function for each wavelength, which is calculated bywhere, as wre f = 1 µm. The wheel irregularity level ( Lw ) values are selected based on the\nirregularity spectrums of Figure 6, for both cases: initial polygonization or polygonal damage . Considering phase angles ( ψθ ) to the sine functions that are uniformly and randomly distributed between 0 and 2π, several wheel irregularities are In the case of polygonal damage, simulating different amplitudes are applied atobtain two different damage severities in the function of amplitude ranges, one between\n0. mm and 0. mm (a1) and the other between 0. mm and 1. mm (a2).

In this model, the train is coupled to the track using a 3D wheel-rail contact model, using Hertzian theory to calculate the normal contact forces andsoftware.

A graphical representation of the numerical model is shown in Figure 9. Note that the first wheel of the first wagon on the right side isA series of accelerometers are mounted along the track to detect a polygonized wheel.\nAccording to the results demonstrated in Mosleh et al. , the location of the most promising sensors for obtaining good results is on the rail. However, the possibility of placing the sensors on the sleepers was also analyzed, since their installation is much easier. Using a virtual wayside monitoring system, acceleration measurements were\nevaluated from 16 positions, as shown in Figure 10. In this figure, the numbers 1-to-4 andsleepers on the right and left sides, respectively, while the accelerations over the sleepers are measured by sensors located on positions 9-to-12 and 13-to-16.

Once validated,Based on several speeds, loading schemes, and unevenness profiles of the rail, Table 3\nsummarizes the simulations of the undamaged and damaged scenarios. Baseline scenariosconsider vehicle speeds between 40 and 120 km/h, and four unevenness profiles are considered for rail irregularities . A total of six types of loading schemes are\nconsidered: (i) a fully loaded train, (ii) a half-loaded train, (iii) an empty train, and trains with an unbalanced load in the transversal and longitudinal directions, namely (iv) UNB1,\n(v) UNB2, and (vi) UNB3. In accordance with UIC loading guidelines , differentgravity is longitudinally and transversally offset. For baseline scenarios, 113 simulationswheels with initial polygonal profiles. Therefore, in addition to 113 analyses with healthy wheels, 30 scenarios are considered with three semi-imperfection cases, including: (i) the right wheel on the front wheelset of the first wagon, (ii) the left wheel of the rear wheelset of the third wagon; (iii) the right wheel of the rear wheelset of the fifth wagon.

By comparing the results from Figure 11a,b, it is evident that the acceleration variation for the healthy wheel\nis between − 1. to 2. m/s , while the defective one changes between − 70 to 100 m/s .**Figure 11.** Acceleration time-series on position 1 for ( **a** ) healthy wheel and wheel with semiimperfection profile, ( **b** ) damaged wheel.As the first step in the automatic damage detection method, damage-sensitive features are extracted from dynamic responses. As mentioned in Section 2.1, the ARX and CWT\nmodels are implemented and their performances as feature extractors are compared.\nTo establish a suitable ARX model order, AIC values are ascendingly ranked from\n1 to 70. An average AIC function is presented in Figure 12 based on 113 baseline analyses.\nIt is evident from this figure that after model order 40, the AIC values tend to stabilize,\nshowing that higher orders do not provide additional information. Therefore, the ARX models’ input and output orders are set to 40, and a total of 80 features are extracted. The\nsensor installed at position 5 ( yj in Equation (1)) is used as output, while each of the otherof the features extracted by the ARX models is higher than the CWT method.

Overall, the presenceregardless of the technique applied. Thus, the feature normalization step is implemented**Figure 13.** Feature extraction for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–feature 3, ( **b** ) ARX–feature 36, ( **c** ) CWT–featureout to obtain indicators that are more sensitive to damage and less sensitive to EOVs. The Latent Variable Method PCA is applied for data normalization. As explained in Section 5.1,\nfor all 173 train passages, 3-dimensional CWT-double-PCA-based feature matrices of\n173 × 468 are calculated for each sensor. At the same time, the ARX model is implementedsensor. Note that the PCA matrices have the same dimensions as the feature extraction step In Figure 14, the same four features shown in Figure 13 for sensor 1 are shown after\nimplementing PCA for all undamaged and damaged scenarios. During the modeling process, components with a cumulative percentage of variances higher than 80% are discarded. Therefore, the number of discarded rows is seventeen and two for CWT-doublePCA-based and ARX-PCA-based methods, respectively. The results obtained are quite\ndifferent depending on the method applied as a feature extractor. A reduction in theobserved in Figure 14a,b. However, CWT-double-PCA-based parameters in Figure 14c,d,\nshow a more effective normalization of the baseline features.

Therefore, in the first stage, Mahalanobis\ndistance transfers 468 CWT-double-PCA-based parameters into one column (173 × 1) for each sensor and train passage. At the same time, 80 ARX-PCA-based parameters are\nconverted to a single damage-sensitive feature (173 × 1). Figure 15 demonstrates theARX-PCA and CWT-double-PCA considering sensor 1. It is possible to observe that this process significantly improves damage detection sensitivity for both approaches.**Figure 15.** Features fusion for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based, ( **b** ) CWT–double–PCA–based.Afterwards, in the second stage, all sensor information is merged to improve the sensitivity to the damage even more.

Therefore, it is possible to conclude that using ARX models as feature extractors**Figure 17.** Automatic wheel defect detection ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based ( **b** ) CWT–double–PCA–based.To reduce the time of installation and maintenance costs, it is necessary to obtain an\noptimal number of sensors, as well as a suitable location to install them without compromising the quality of the detection. As a result, a parametric study is carried out using\naccelerometers at distinct locations. In this analysis, only CWT is used for feature extraction because, as shown in Figure 17b, it is the best technique (with no false positives) compared(as presented in Figure 10) in terms of the total number (two, four, and six) are analyzed and the effectiveness of the detection methodology is demonstrated in Figure 18. The results concluded that even with two sensors (one on each side of the rail), the proposed**Figure 18.** Automatic polygonized wheel detection based on CWT technique considering: ( **a** ) sixIn the previous section, the proposed approach to detect a defective wheel from a healthy one was implemented for accelerometers located on the rail.

Further, in the study by Peng , the mechanisms of\nOOR formation on wheels were presented considering different wear prediction models.\nConsidering recent technological advances, it is now possible to develop and implement automatic methodologies for detecting and identifying damage in different systems [15–17] for railway applications. With the application of these intelligent techniques, it\nis not intended to completely replace the visual inspections already used for many decades,\nbut rather, the creation of a compatible procedure. Traditional visual inspection and control techniques are expensive, occur at intervals, and are prone to errors, it is important to\nmotivate the widespread use of Structural Integrity Monitoring (SIE) systems, especially in\nrecent infrastructures or in systems of high value to society, as in the case of railway systems . Thus, it is essential to develop automatic methodologies for detecting different Despite the widespread research on railway defect detection, to the knowledge of the authors, the reported literature on automatic wheel polygonization identification has been limited so far. Therefore, taking advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies, it isan early stage. The detection of polygonized wheels is largely carried out using accelerometers mounted on the vehicle. The parametric power spectral estimation and adaptive chirpresults, but with flaws in polygonization detection in the early stages [19–21].\nOn the other hand, previous studies have shown very good results using waysidelearning in detecting defects in railway vehicle wheels, namely wheel flat detections .\nThis type of methodology usually presents the following steps: (i) feature extractionusing data from accelerations or strains measured on the track, (ii) feature modelingand operational variations, (iii) data fusion to merge different features and/or sensors information, and (iv) features discrimination to classify the defects. The studies carriedidentifying singular irregularities on the wheel surface (i.e., wheel flat). In this context, itcomprehensive number of damages, namely the ones that may occur along the entire Several methods have been used for feature extraction, which converts time-series\ndata into more condensed information, allowing damage to be more easily observed.\nSymbolic data, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) [15–17], principal component analysis\n(PCA) , and autoregressive models [15–17] are examples of effective techniques for\nextracting damage-sensitive features for both static and dynamic monitoring.

CWT and PCA have been developed over decades in different applications, in both time and frequency domains with various sensors.

Due to its simplicity and ability to reduce multivariate data, Mahalanobis\nRecent approaches based on machine learning have been applied for feature classification to differentiate a healthy wheel from a defective one . Typically, two different approaches are used: (i) unsupervised methods, in which models are trained using labeled data under the supervision of training data, such as k-means , self-organizing maps\n(SOM) , and cluster analysis; or (ii) supervised methods, in which models are not supervised using training datasets, such as Naive Bayes classifiers and k-Nearest Neighbor\nThis work aims: (i) to develop an unsupervised methodology to identify polygonized\nwheels; (ii) to evaluate the performance of different feature extraction techniques concerning their sensitivity to the detection of wheel polygonization, specifically those based on\nautoregressive exogenous models (ARX) and continuous wavelet transforms (CWT); (iii) towheel defect detection system. The unsupervised methodology to identify polygonized wheels consists of five phases: (i) data acquisition, (ii) feature extraction, (iii) feature The acquired track responses are influenced by parameters such as speed, irregularities, and load types. In this sense, different simulations of realistic scenarios of dynamicconditions. On the other hand, to overcome some unpredictable oscillations in the measured responses and consequent failures in damage detection, some options can be taken.\nIn more complex structures, such as bridges and viaducts, there should be a greater susceptibility to damage when compared to areas of track sections on the foundation ground. If the structures are damaged, they may camouflage or cause false warnings. In a practical context, the use of sensors in an area of the track less prone to damage and where vibrationmethodology. Aligned on these assumptions, the location of the sensors was chosen on aAfter defining the AI approach for identifying wheel polygonization, two distinguished feature extraction methods, namely ARX and CWT, are compared. To avoid\nfalse alarm situations caused by environmental and operational effects, the latent variable method Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied. To reduce the volume of extracted data while retaining the most relevant information, as well as improve the ability to characterize the measured phenomenon, the data are merged using the Mahalanobis distance. As\na final step, an outlier analysis is employed to automatically distinguish a healthy wheel It should be highlighted that wheel flat identification was developed by Mosleh et al. ,\nwho demonstrated that the methodology is able to identify wheel flats.

Moreover, ai, bk, ma, and mb are the parameters and the orders of the output and Initially, it is difficult to determine the most appropriate ARX model order. The key issue is that higher-order models could better match the data, but they may not generalize\nto other datasets. Otherwise, a low-order model is unlikely to capture the underlying physical system response. Several authors have noted the difficulty of defining a unique order for ARX models. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is reported to be one of the most effective optimization techniques . Based on the exchange between fit accuracy and the number of estimated parameters, AIC measures the goodness-of-fit of an estimatedparameters, respectively, and ε is the average sum-of-square residual ( SSR ) errors. To find out an optimum order, one should examine a wide range of orders and choose the orderStudies conducted by Li et al. showed good results in gearbox fault detection.\nCWT produces a two-dimensional set of coefficients from the analyzed signal. Although the Fourier transforms typically use sine waves as the basis for decomposition, other functionscan be selected for the wavelet shape due to signal properties. Two parameters define wavelet analysis: scale and translation. The CWT ( T ) of the signal x ( t ) is determined aswhere a and b are the scale and translation parameters, and ψ [∗] is the complex conjugate of the mother wavelet T that involves a continuous function in both time and frequency domains.\nAfter the implementation of a CWT on the evaluated signals, a PCA is performed\nfollowed by the extraction of four statistical parameters, resulting in significant data compression . Based on the p -by- q matrix X containing the extracted CWT features from the original signal evaluated by each sensor, where p is the measurement points number and q is the wavelets coefficients number, the principal components can be determinedwhere Ss represents the scores matrix, and T is a q -by- q orthonormal linear transformation matrix. In addition, four statistical parameters are extracted from the scores, Ss, including the root mean square (RMS), standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. Thus, a matrix p -by- q is transformed into a k -by- q matrix, where k equals 4. Consequently, a total of k × qenvironmental and operational variations (EOVs). For example, in damage detection, itare mostly sensitive to damage . Therefore, implementing a latent variable method,\nnamely the PCA, may efficiently reduce EOVs influences, without requiring the direct measurement of those effects. According to Bro and Smilde , PCA is a powerful and versatile method capable of providing an overview of complex multivariate data. PCA can be used to find and quantify patterns, generate new hypotheses, detect outliers, or find\nBy considering a m -by- f matrix X, taking into account features extracted from the dynamic responses, where m represents the train passages and f represents the number of\nfeatures extracted from sensors (i.e., k × q ), a transformation to another set of f features, Ss,\nis obtained by considering Equation (4). Considering the baseline condition, the covariance matrix ( C ) of the features is related to the covariance matrix of the scores Λ, as follows:where, Λ and T are matrices calculated by the singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix C . The columns of T are the eigenvectors and the diagonal matrix Λ, including\nthe eigenvalues of the matrix C in descending order. Thus, the eigenvalues stored in Λ areIt is possible to divide matrix Λ into two matrices with the first n eigenvalues and the remaining f-n eigenvalues. Determining the number of n -components is one of the\nchallenges in multivariate data interpretation. In this research study, n -components are\ndiscarded when the cumulative percentage of variance reaches 80% . Once n\nhas been selected, Equation (4) can be used to calculate the f-n components of matrix S. The transformation matrix T [ˆ] is constructed by the remaining f-n columns of matrix T . Using\nthe following function, the f-n components can be remapped to the main space:where, FPCA is m -by- f matrix of PCA features which is less sensitive to EOVs. Every sensorindex definition, is easy to implement and fast to process . For each simulation, the MD is considered to calculate a damage index (DI). Several damage identification studies haveDI . The MD is a well-known distance metric because it measures the distance\nbetween two points in a feature space containing two or more variables . Furthermore,\nit considers correlations between variables and does not depend on the scale of the features.\nIt can merge features from multiple sensors by performing data fusion. Mahalanobis\ndistance (namely here as DI ) is calculated by the following function:in which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−] , and is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The covariance matrix and mean vector intend to incorporate the baseline simulation. Based on the data derived from the\ndamaged system, a new observation would be far from the average of normal conditions.\nMahalanobis distances are calculated for each sensor and simulation. A matrix containing m Mahalanobis distances for i sensors is obtained from the above calculations.To automatically monitor train wheel conditions, the methodology performs outlier analysis.

Therefore,In real conditions, the wheels are not entirely smooth and have imperfections. Despite\ntheir small size, these out-of-roundness irregularities can cause extreme variations in the wheelrail contact forces, producing vibrations on the train and track components. A periodic radial\ntread irregularity around the wheel circumference characterizes the wheel polygonization.\nAccording to Peng , for wheel polygonization, the irregularity amplitudes should be higher than 0. mm. Inherent to polygonization, some parameters can geometrically characterize the phenomenon, such as the varying wavelengths (λ) in the function of the harmonic order (θ)Two groups of polygonal wheel profiles are generated for the numerical simulations,\none for undamaged scenarios and another for damaged scenarios, based on real wheel measurements, the irregularity amplitude spectra of which are presented in Figure 6.**Figure 6.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) ( **a** ) initial polygonalFor the first group of profiles, the measurement data obtained by Johansson et al.\nfor new wheels with wavelengths comprising 20 harmonics were used .

By comparing the results from Figure 11a,b, it is evident that the acceleration variation for the healthy wheel\nis between − 1. to 2. m/s , while the defective one changes between − 70 to 100 m/s .**Figure 11.** Acceleration time-series on position 1 for ( **a** ) healthy wheel and wheel with semiimperfection profile, ( **b** ) damaged wheel.As the first step in the automatic damage detection method, damage-sensitive features are extracted from dynamic responses. As mentioned in Section 2.1, the ARX and CWT\nmodels are implemented and their performances as feature extractors are compared.\nTo establish a suitable ARX model order, AIC values are ascendingly ranked from\n1 to 70. An average AIC function is presented in Figure 12 based on 113 baseline analyses.\nIt is evident from this figure that after model order 40, the AIC values tend to stabilize,\nshowing that higher orders do not provide additional information. Therefore, the ARX models’ input and output orders are set to 40, and a total of 80 features are extracted.

Langnebäck pointed out that systems\napplied to vehicles for detecting damage on the vehicle components are quite expensive,since sensors are required in all vehicles. Therefore, this method becomes economicallyby the damage to be identified. In addition, the substantial number of existing vehiclestechnology for detecting damage in each of them. In summary, despite the high precision for monitoring defective wheels, these on-board systems require a high installation cost to\nIn a wayside monitoring system, the wheel-rail contact interface plays a significant role.\nAt this point, the dynamic forces of wheel-rail interaction are established, which allows the acquisition of relevant information about various factors inherent to the traffic conditions .\nAlthough these components represent a high maintenance cost, serious accidents with high economic losses and possible human injuries can be avoided. Regarding railway safety, wheel defects are one of the main causes of accidents , causing interruptionsreliability. Furthermore, these defects promote negative effects on both the vehicle and\nFurthermore, wheels deteriorate over time due to wear and fatigue, which may develop various defects such as polygonization, flats and shelling, altering the wheel-rail contact characteristics and, consequently, causing greater impact forces .

In the research study by Cai et al. , the mechanism\nof polygon formation on metro wheels was investigated based on experimental measurements and numerical simulations. Further, in the study by Peng , the mechanisms of\nOOR formation on wheels were presented considering different wear prediction models.\nConsidering recent technological advances, it is now possible to develop and implement automatic methodologies for detecting and identifying damage in different systems [15–17] for railway applications. With the application of these intelligent techniques, it\nis not intended to completely replace the visual inspections already used for many decades,\nbut rather, the creation of a compatible procedure. Traditional visual inspection and control techniques are expensive, occur at intervals, and are prone to errors, it is important to\nmotivate the widespread use of Structural Integrity Monitoring (SIE) systems, especially in\nrecent infrastructures or in systems of high value to society, as in the case of railway systems . Thus, it is essential to develop automatic methodologies for detecting different Despite the widespread research on railway defect detection, to the knowledge of the authors, the reported literature on automatic wheel polygonization identification has been limited so far. Therefore, taking advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies, it isan early stage. The detection of polygonized wheels is largely carried out using accelerometers mounted on the vehicle. The parametric power spectral estimation and adaptive chirpresults, but with flaws in polygonization detection in the early stages [19–21].\nOn the other hand, previous studies have shown very good results using waysidelearning in detecting defects in railway vehicle wheels, namely wheel flat detections .\nThis type of methodology usually presents the following steps: (i) feature extractionusing data from accelerations or strains measured on the track, (ii) feature modelingand operational variations, (iii) data fusion to merge different features and/or sensors information, and (iv) features discrimination to classify the defects. The studies carriedidentifying singular irregularities on the wheel surface (i.e., wheel flat). In this context, itcomprehensive number of damages, namely the ones that may occur along the entire Several methods have been used for feature extraction, which converts time-series\ndata into more condensed information, allowing damage to be more easily observed.\nSymbolic data, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) [15–17], principal component analysis\n(PCA) , and autoregressive models [15–17] are examples of effective techniques for\nextracting damage-sensitive features for both static and dynamic monitoring. In timedomain applications where the measured quantity is acceleration, autoregressive modelson the system response, with the model parameters reflecting the properties of the system regardless of the sources of excitations. CWT and PCA have been developed over decades in different applications, in both time and frequency domains with various sensors. Despite this, they present some limitations, PCA does not consider the non-linearity of the data\nand CWT adds excess redundancy to the data, and it has a high computational cost, so For feature fusion, several algorithms, including neighborhood-preserving embedding\n(NPE) , neural networks , Mahalanobis distance , manifold learning methods , and kernel-based methods , have been recently employed.

Due to its simplicity and ability to reduce multivariate data, Mahalanobis\nRecent approaches based on machine learning have been applied for feature classification to differentiate a healthy wheel from a defective one . Typically, two different approaches are used: (i) unsupervised methods, in which models are trained using labeled data under the supervision of training data, such as k-means , self-organizing maps\n(SOM) , and cluster analysis; or (ii) supervised methods, in which models are not supervised using training datasets, such as Naive Bayes classifiers and k-Nearest Neighbor\nThis work aims: (i) to develop an unsupervised methodology to identify polygonized\nwheels; (ii) to evaluate the performance of different feature extraction techniques concerning their sensitivity to the detection of wheel polygonization, specifically those based on\nautoregressive exogenous models (ARX) and continuous wavelet transforms (CWT); (iii) towheel defect detection system. The unsupervised methodology to identify polygonized wheels consists of five phases: (i) data acquisition, (ii) feature extraction, (iii) feature The acquired track responses are influenced by parameters such as speed, irregularities, and load types. In this sense, different simulations of realistic scenarios of dynamicconditions. On the other hand, to overcome some unpredictable oscillations in the measured responses and consequent failures in damage detection, some options can be taken.\nIn more complex structures, such as bridges and viaducts, there should be a greater susceptibility to damage when compared to areas of track sections on the foundation ground. If the structures are damaged, they may camouflage or cause false warnings. In a practical context, the use of sensors in an area of the track less prone to damage and where vibrationmethodology. Aligned on these assumptions, the location of the sensors was chosen on aAfter defining the AI approach for identifying wheel polygonization, two distinguished feature extraction methods, namely ARX and CWT, are compared. To avoid\nfalse alarm situations caused by environmental and operational effects, the latent variable method Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied. To reduce the volume of extracted data while retaining the most relevant information, as well as improve the ability to characterize the measured phenomenon, the data are merged using the Mahalanobis distance. As\na final step, an outlier analysis is employed to automatically distinguish a healthy wheel It should be highlighted that wheel flat identification was developed by Mosleh et al. ,\nwho demonstrated that the methodology is able to identify wheel flats.

The outcome of this stepDI identifies a healthy or a defective wheel; a statistical confidence boundary (CB) isIn this study, the features are extracted based on autoregressive models with exogenous inputs (ARX) and continuous wavelet transform (CWT) models.

The ARX autoregressive model considers the predictive behavior of the system at a specific location, considering its history at the same\npoint and the predictive response at other measurement locations, being defined by the### xj = ∑ aixj−i +### ∑ bkyj−k + ε j (1)where xj, yj, and ε j are the output, input, as well as error term of the model at the signal value j . Moreover, ai, bk, ma, and mb are the parameters and the orders of the output and Initially, it is difficult to determine the most appropriate ARX model order. The key issue is that higher-order models could better match the data, but they may not generalize\nto other datasets. Otherwise, a low-order model is unlikely to capture the underlying physical system response. Several authors have noted the difficulty of defining a unique order for ARX models. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is reported to be one of the most effective optimization techniques . Based on the exchange between fit accuracy and the number of estimated parameters, AIC measures the goodness-of-fit of an estimatedparameters, respectively, and ε is the average sum-of-square residual ( SSR ) errors. To find out an optimum order, one should examine a wide range of orders and choose the orderStudies conducted by Li et al. showed good results in gearbox fault detection.\nCWT produces a two-dimensional set of coefficients from the analyzed signal. Although the Fourier transforms typically use sine waves as the basis for decomposition, other functionscan be selected for the wavelet shape due to signal properties. Two parameters define wavelet analysis: scale and translation. The CWT ( T ) of the signal x ( t ) is determined aswhere a and b are the scale and translation parameters, and ψ [∗] is the complex conjugate of the mother wavelet T that involves a continuous function in both time and frequency domains.\nAfter the implementation of a CWT on the evaluated signals, a PCA is performed\nfollowed by the extraction of four statistical parameters, resulting in significant data compression . Based on the p -by- q matrix X containing the extracted CWT features from the original signal evaluated by each sensor, where p is the measurement points number and q is the wavelets coefficients number, the principal components can be determinedwhere Ss represents the scores matrix, and T is a q -by- q orthonormal linear transformation matrix. In addition, four statistical parameters are extracted from the scores, Ss, including the root mean square (RMS), standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. Thus, a matrix p -by- q is transformed into a k -by- q matrix, where k equals 4. Consequently, a total of k × qenvironmental and operational variations (EOVs). For example, in damage detection, itare mostly sensitive to damage . Therefore, implementing a latent variable method,\nnamely the PCA, may efficiently reduce EOVs influences, without requiring the direct measurement of those effects. According to Bro and Smilde , PCA is a powerful and versatile method capable of providing an overview of complex multivariate data. PCA can be used to find and quantify patterns, generate new hypotheses, detect outliers, or find\nBy considering a m -by- f matrix X, taking into account features extracted from the dynamic responses, where m represents the train passages and f represents the number of\nfeatures extracted from sensors (i.e., k × q ), a transformation to another set of f features, Ss,\nis obtained by considering Equation (4). Considering the baseline condition, the covariance matrix ( C ) of the features is related to the covariance matrix of the scores Λ, as follows:where, Λ and T are matrices calculated by the singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix C . The columns of T are the eigenvectors and the diagonal matrix Λ, including\nthe eigenvalues of the matrix C in descending order. Thus, the eigenvalues stored in Λ areIt is possible to divide matrix Λ into two matrices with the first n eigenvalues and the remaining f-n eigenvalues. Determining the number of n -components is one of the\nchallenges in multivariate data interpretation. In this research study, n -components are\ndiscarded when the cumulative percentage of variance reaches 80% . Once n\nhas been selected, Equation (4) can be used to calculate the f-n components of matrix S. The transformation matrix T [ˆ] is constructed by the remaining f-n columns of matrix T . Using\nthe following function, the f-n components can be remapped to the main space:where, FPCA is m -by- f matrix of PCA features which is less sensitive to EOVs. Every sensorindex definition, is easy to implement and fast to process . For each simulation, the MD is considered to calculate a damage index (DI). Several damage identification studies haveDI . The MD is a well-known distance metric because it measures the distance\nbetween two points in a feature space containing two or more variables . Furthermore,\nit considers correlations between variables and does not depend on the scale of the features.\nIt can merge features from multiple sensors by performing data fusion. Mahalanobis\ndistance (namely here as DI ) is calculated by the following function:in which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−] , and is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The covariance matrix and mean vector intend to incorporate the baseline simulation. Based on the data derived from the\ndamaged system, a new observation would be far from the average of normal conditions.\nMahalanobis distances are calculated for each sensor and simulation. A matrix containing m Mahalanobis distances for i sensors is obtained from the above calculations.To automatically monitor train wheel conditions, the methodology performs outlier analysis. In Meixedo et al. and Mosleh et al. , this tool proved to be very efficient in\nclassifying the data as being related to a scenario with or without damage. Mahalanobisspace. A Gaussian distribution can be used to approximate the Mahalanobis distance, and statistical thresholds can be used to analyze outliers. By considering a mean value and standard deviation σ of the baseline feature vector, as well as the significance level α, itconsequently, when DI is equal to or higher than CB, a feature is considered to be an outlier.In the present research, the Laagrss freight train composed of five wagons is studied.\nAccording to the UIC classification, it can reach a top speed of 120 km/h .

Therefore,In real conditions, the wheels are not entirely smooth and have imperfections. Despite\ntheir small size, these out-of-roundness irregularities can cause extreme variations in the wheelrail contact forces, producing vibrations on the train and track components. A periodic radial\ntread irregularity around the wheel circumference characterizes the wheel polygonization.\nAccording to Peng , for wheel polygonization, the irregularity amplitudes should be higher than 0. mm. Inherent to polygonization, some parameters can geometrically characterize the phenomenon, such as the varying wavelengths (λ) in the function of the harmonic order (θ)Two groups of polygonal wheel profiles are generated for the numerical simulations,\none for undamaged scenarios and another for damaged scenarios, based on real wheel measurements, the irregularity amplitude spectra of which are presented in Figure 6.**Figure 6.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) ( **a** ) initial polygonalFor the first group of profiles, the measurement data obtained by Johansson et al.\nfor new wheels with wavelengths comprising 20 harmonics were used .

A graphical representation of the numerical model is shown in Figure 9. Note that the first wheel of the first wagon on the right side isA series of accelerometers are mounted along the track to detect a polygonized wheel.\nAccording to the results demonstrated in Mosleh et al. , the location of the most promising sensors for obtaining good results is on the rail. However, the possibility of placing the sensors on the sleepers was also analyzed, since their installation is much easier. Using a virtual wayside monitoring system, acceleration measurements were\nevaluated from 16 positions, as shown in Figure 10.

Once validated,Based on several speeds, loading schemes, and unevenness profiles of the rail, Table 3\nsummarizes the simulations of the undamaged and damaged scenarios. Baseline scenariosconsider vehicle speeds between 40 and 120 km/h, and four unevenness profiles are considered for rail irregularities . A total of six types of loading schemes are\nconsidered: (i) a fully loaded train, (ii) a half-loaded train, (iii) an empty train, and trains with an unbalanced load in the transversal and longitudinal directions, namely (iv) UNB1,\n(v) UNB2, and (vi) UNB3. In accordance with UIC loading guidelines , differentgravity is longitudinally and transversally offset. For baseline scenarios, 113 simulationswheels with initial polygonal profiles. Therefore, in addition to 113 analyses with healthy wheels, 30 scenarios are considered with three semi-imperfection cases, including: (i) the right wheel on the front wheelset of the first wagon, (ii) the left wheel of the rear wheelset of the third wagon; (iii) the right wheel of the rear wheelset of the fifth wagon.

By comparing the results from Figure 11a,b, it is evident that the acceleration variation for the healthy wheel\nis between − 1. to 2. m/s , while the defective one changes between − 70 to 100 m/s .**Figure 11.** Acceleration time-series on position 1 for ( **a** ) healthy wheel and wheel with semiimperfection profile, ( **b** ) damaged wheel.As the first step in the automatic damage detection method, damage-sensitive features are extracted from dynamic responses. As mentioned in Section 2.1, the ARX and CWT\nmodels are implemented and their performances as feature extractors are compared.\nTo establish a suitable ARX model order, AIC values are ascendingly ranked from\n1 to 70. An average AIC function is presented in Figure 12 based on 113 baseline analyses.\nIt is evident from this figure that after model order 40, the AIC values tend to stabilize,\nshowing that higher orders do not provide additional information. Therefore, the ARX models’ input and output orders are set to 40, and a total of 80 features are extracted. The\nsensor installed at position 5 ( yj in Equation (1)) is used as output, while each of the otherof the features extracted by the ARX models is higher than the CWT method.

Therefore, in the first stage, Mahalanobis\ndistance transfers 468 CWT-double-PCA-based parameters into one column (173 × 1) for each sensor and train passage. At the same time, 80 ARX-PCA-based parameters are\nconverted to a single damage-sensitive feature (173 × 1). Figure 15 demonstrates theARX-PCA and CWT-double-PCA considering sensor 1.

Therefore, this method becomes economicallyby the damage to be identified. In addition, the substantial number of existing vehiclestechnology for detecting damage in each of them. In summary, despite the high precision for monitoring defective wheels, these on-board systems require a high installation cost to\nIn a wayside monitoring system, the wheel-rail contact interface plays a significant role.\nAt this point, the dynamic forces of wheel-rail interaction are established, which allows the acquisition of relevant information about various factors inherent to the traffic conditions .\nAlthough these components represent a high maintenance cost, serious accidents with high economic losses and possible human injuries can be avoided. Regarding railway safety, wheel defects are one of the main causes of accidents , causing interruptionsreliability. Furthermore, these defects promote negative effects on both the vehicle and\nFurthermore, wheels deteriorate over time due to wear and fatigue, which may develop various defects such as polygonization, flats and shelling, altering the wheel-rail contact characteristics and, consequently, causing greater impact forces .

In the research study by Cai et al. , the mechanism\nof polygon formation on metro wheels was investigated based on experimental measurements and numerical simulations. Further, in the study by Peng , the mechanisms of\nOOR formation on wheels were presented considering different wear prediction models.\nConsidering recent technological advances, it is now possible to develop and implement automatic methodologies for detecting and identifying damage in different systems [15–17] for railway applications. With the application of these intelligent techniques, it\nis not intended to completely replace the visual inspections already used for many decades,\nbut rather, the creation of a compatible procedure. Traditional visual inspection and control techniques are expensive, occur at intervals, and are prone to errors, it is important to\nmotivate the widespread use of Structural Integrity Monitoring (SIE) systems, especially in\nrecent infrastructures or in systems of high value to society, as in the case of railway systems . Thus, it is essential to develop automatic methodologies for detecting different Despite the widespread research on railway defect detection, to the knowledge of the authors, the reported literature on automatic wheel polygonization identification has been limited so far. Therefore, taking advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies, it isan early stage. The detection of polygonized wheels is largely carried out using accelerometers mounted on the vehicle. The parametric power spectral estimation and adaptive chirpresults, but with flaws in polygonization detection in the early stages [19–21].\nOn the other hand, previous studies have shown very good results using waysidelearning in detecting defects in railway vehicle wheels, namely wheel flat detections .\nThis type of methodology usually presents the following steps: (i) feature extractionusing data from accelerations or strains measured on the track, (ii) feature modelingand operational variations, (iii) data fusion to merge different features and/or sensors information, and (iv) features discrimination to classify the defects. The studies carriedidentifying singular irregularities on the wheel surface (i.e., wheel flat). In this context, itcomprehensive number of damages, namely the ones that may occur along the entire Several methods have been used for feature extraction, which converts time-series\ndata into more condensed information, allowing damage to be more easily observed.\nSymbolic data, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) [15–17], principal component analysis\n(PCA) , and autoregressive models [15–17] are examples of effective techniques for\nextracting damage-sensitive features for both static and dynamic monitoring. In timedomain applications where the measured quantity is acceleration, autoregressive modelson the system response, with the model parameters reflecting the properties of the system regardless of the sources of excitations. CWT and PCA have been developed over decades in different applications, in both time and frequency domains with various sensors. Despite this, they present some limitations, PCA does not consider the non-linearity of the data\nand CWT adds excess redundancy to the data, and it has a high computational cost, so For feature fusion, several algorithms, including neighborhood-preserving embedding\n(NPE) , neural networks , Mahalanobis distance , manifold learning methods , and kernel-based methods , have been recently employed.

Due to its simplicity and ability to reduce multivariate data, Mahalanobis\nRecent approaches based on machine learning have been applied for feature classification to differentiate a healthy wheel from a defective one . Typically, two different approaches are used: (i) unsupervised methods, in which models are trained using labeled data under the supervision of training data, such as k-means , self-organizing maps\n(SOM) , and cluster analysis; or (ii) supervised methods, in which models are not supervised using training datasets, such as Naive Bayes classifiers and k-Nearest Neighbor\nThis work aims: (i) to develop an unsupervised methodology to identify polygonized\nwheels; (ii) to evaluate the performance of different feature extraction techniques concerning their sensitivity to the detection of wheel polygonization, specifically those based on\nautoregressive exogenous models (ARX) and continuous wavelet transforms (CWT); (iii) towheel defect detection system. The unsupervised methodology to identify polygonized wheels consists of five phases: (i) data acquisition, (ii) feature extraction, (iii) feature The acquired track responses are influenced by parameters such as speed, irregularities, and load types. In this sense, different simulations of realistic scenarios of dynamicconditions. On the other hand, to overcome some unpredictable oscillations in the measured responses and consequent failures in damage detection, some options can be taken.\nIn more complex structures, such as bridges and viaducts, there should be a greater susceptibility to damage when compared to areas of track sections on the foundation ground. If the structures are damaged, they may camouflage or cause false warnings. In a practical context, the use of sensors in an area of the track less prone to damage and where vibrationmethodology. Aligned on these assumptions, the location of the sensors was chosen on aAfter defining the AI approach for identifying wheel polygonization, two distinguished feature extraction methods, namely ARX and CWT, are compared. To avoid\nfalse alarm situations caused by environmental and operational effects, the latent variable method Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied. To reduce the volume of extracted data while retaining the most relevant information, as well as improve the ability to characterize the measured phenomenon, the data are merged using the Mahalanobis distance. As\na final step, an outlier analysis is employed to automatically distinguish a healthy wheel It should be highlighted that wheel flat identification was developed by Mosleh et al. ,\nwho demonstrated that the methodology is able to identify wheel flats.

The outcome of this stepDI identifies a healthy or a defective wheel; a statistical confidence boundary (CB) isIn this study, the features are extracted based on autoregressive models with exogenous inputs (ARX) and continuous wavelet transform (CWT) models.

The ARX autoregressive model considers the predictive behavior of the system at a specific location, considering its history at the same\npoint and the predictive response at other measurement locations, being defined by the### xj = ∑ aixj−i +### ∑ bkyj−k + ε j (1)where xj, yj, and ε j are the output, input, as well as error term of the model at the signal value j . Moreover, ai, bk, ma, and mb are the parameters and the orders of the output and Initially, it is difficult to determine the most appropriate ARX model order. The key issue is that higher-order models could better match the data, but they may not generalize\nto other datasets. Otherwise, a low-order model is unlikely to capture the underlying physical system response. Several authors have noted the difficulty of defining a unique order for ARX models. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is reported to be one of the most effective optimization techniques . Based on the exchange between fit accuracy and the number of estimated parameters, AIC measures the goodness-of-fit of an estimatedparameters, respectively, and ε is the average sum-of-square residual ( SSR ) errors. To find out an optimum order, one should examine a wide range of orders and choose the orderStudies conducted by Li et al. showed good results in gearbox fault detection.\nCWT produces a two-dimensional set of coefficients from the analyzed signal. Although the Fourier transforms typically use sine waves as the basis for decomposition, other functionscan be selected for the wavelet shape due to signal properties. Two parameters define wavelet analysis: scale and translation. The CWT ( T ) of the signal x ( t ) is determined aswhere a and b are the scale and translation parameters, and ψ [∗] is the complex conjugate of the mother wavelet T that involves a continuous function in both time and frequency domains.\nAfter the implementation of a CWT on the evaluated signals, a PCA is performed\nfollowed by the extraction of four statistical parameters, resulting in significant data compression . Based on the p -by- q matrix X containing the extracted CWT features from the original signal evaluated by each sensor, where p is the measurement points number and q is the wavelets coefficients number, the principal components can be determinedwhere Ss represents the scores matrix, and T is a q -by- q orthonormal linear transformation matrix. In addition, four statistical parameters are extracted from the scores, Ss, including the root mean square (RMS), standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. Thus, a matrix p -by- q is transformed into a k -by- q matrix, where k equals 4. Consequently, a total of k × qenvironmental and operational variations (EOVs). For example, in damage detection, itare mostly sensitive to damage . Therefore, implementing a latent variable method,\nnamely the PCA, may efficiently reduce EOVs influences, without requiring the direct measurement of those effects. According to Bro and Smilde , PCA is a powerful and versatile method capable of providing an overview of complex multivariate data. PCA can be used to find and quantify patterns, generate new hypotheses, detect outliers, or find\nBy considering a m -by- f matrix X, taking into account features extracted from the dynamic responses, where m represents the train passages and f represents the number of\nfeatures extracted from sensors (i.e., k × q ), a transformation to another set of f features, Ss,\nis obtained by considering Equation (4). Considering the baseline condition, the covariance matrix ( C ) of the features is related to the covariance matrix of the scores Λ, as follows:where, Λ and T are matrices calculated by the singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix C . The columns of T are the eigenvectors and the diagonal matrix Λ, including\nthe eigenvalues of the matrix C in descending order. Thus, the eigenvalues stored in Λ areIt is possible to divide matrix Λ into two matrices with the first n eigenvalues and the remaining f-n eigenvalues. Determining the number of n -components is one of the\nchallenges in multivariate data interpretation. In this research study, n -components are\ndiscarded when the cumulative percentage of variance reaches 80% . Once n\nhas been selected, Equation (4) can be used to calculate the f-n components of matrix S. The transformation matrix T [ˆ] is constructed by the remaining f-n columns of matrix T . Using\nthe following function, the f-n components can be remapped to the main space:where, FPCA is m -by- f matrix of PCA features which is less sensitive to EOVs. Every sensorindex definition, is easy to implement and fast to process . For each simulation, the MD is considered to calculate a damage index (DI). Several damage identification studies haveDI . The MD is a well-known distance metric because it measures the distance\nbetween two points in a feature space containing two or more variables . Furthermore,\nit considers correlations between variables and does not depend on the scale of the features.\nIt can merge features from multiple sensors by performing data fusion. Mahalanobis\ndistance (namely here as DI ) is calculated by the following function:in which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−] , and is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The covariance matrix and mean vector intend to incorporate the baseline simulation. Based on the data derived from the\ndamaged system, a new observation would be far from the average of normal conditions.\nMahalanobis distances are calculated for each sensor and simulation. A matrix containing m Mahalanobis distances for i sensors is obtained from the above calculations.To automatically monitor train wheel conditions, the methodology performs outlier analysis. In Meixedo et al. and Mosleh et al. , this tool proved to be very efficient in\nclassifying the data as being related to a scenario with or without damage. Mahalanobisspace. A Gaussian distribution can be used to approximate the Mahalanobis distance, and statistical thresholds can be used to analyze outliers. By considering a mean value and standard deviation σ of the baseline feature vector, as well as the significance level α, itconsequently, when DI is equal to or higher than CB, a feature is considered to be an outlier.In the present research, the Laagrss freight train composed of five wagons is studied.\nAccording to the UIC classification, it can reach a top speed of 120 km/h .

Therefore,In real conditions, the wheels are not entirely smooth and have imperfections. Despite\ntheir small size, these out-of-roundness irregularities can cause extreme variations in the wheelrail contact forces, producing vibrations on the train and track components. A periodic radial\ntread irregularity around the wheel circumference characterizes the wheel polygonization.\nAccording to Peng , for wheel polygonization, the irregularity amplitudes should be higher than 0. mm. Inherent to polygonization, some parameters can geometrically characterize the phenomenon, such as the varying wavelengths (λ) in the function of the harmonic order (θ)Two groups of polygonal wheel profiles are generated for the numerical simulations,\none for undamaged scenarios and another for damaged scenarios, based on real wheel measurements, the irregularity amplitude spectra of which are presented in Figure 6.**Figure 6.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) ( **a** ) initial polygonalFor the first group of profiles, the measurement data obtained by Johansson et al.\nfor new wheels with wavelengths comprising 20 harmonics were used .

By comparing the results from Figure 11a,b, it is evident that the acceleration variation for the healthy wheel\nis between − 1. to 2. m/s , while the defective one changes between − 70 to 100 m/s .**Figure 11.** Acceleration time-series on position 1 for ( **a** ) healthy wheel and wheel with semiimperfection profile, ( **b** ) damaged wheel.As the first step in the automatic damage detection method, damage-sensitive features are extracted from dynamic responses. As mentioned in Section 2.1, the ARX and CWT\nmodels are implemented and their performances as feature extractors are compared.\nTo establish a suitable ARX model order, AIC values are ascendingly ranked from\n1 to 70. An average AIC function is presented in Figure 12 based on 113 baseline analyses.\nIt is evident from this figure that after model order 40, the AIC values tend to stabilize,\nshowing that higher orders do not provide additional information. Therefore, the ARX models’ input and output orders are set to 40, and a total of 80 features are extracted. The\nsensor installed at position 5 ( yj in Equation (1)) is used as output, while each of the otherof the features extracted by the ARX models is higher than the CWT method.

In Figure 13b,c, a comparison of baseline and damaged scenarios shows similar variations in amplitude. In Figure 13d, the amplitude variation between healthy\nand damaged scenarios is evident, as the amplitude does not change much for the first\n143 passages, and then increases, which may indicate a wheel defect. Overall, the presenceregardless of the technique applied. Thus, the feature normalization step is implemented**Figure 13.** Feature extraction for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–feature 3, ( **b** ) ARX–feature 36, ( **c** ) CWT–featureout to obtain indicators that are more sensitive to damage and less sensitive to EOVs. The Latent Variable Method PCA is applied for data normalization. As explained in Section 5.1,\nfor all 173 train passages, 3-dimensional CWT-double-PCA-based feature matrices of\n173 × 468 are calculated for each sensor. At the same time, the ARX model is implementedsensor. Note that the PCA matrices have the same dimensions as the feature extraction step In Figure 14, the same four features shown in Figure 13 for sensor 1 are shown after\nimplementing PCA for all undamaged and damaged scenarios. During the modeling process, components with a cumulative percentage of variances higher than 80% are discarded. Therefore, the number of discarded rows is seventeen and two for CWT-doublePCA-based and ARX-PCA-based methods, respectively. The results obtained are quite\ndifferent depending on the method applied as a feature extractor. A reduction in theobserved in Figure 14a,b. However, CWT-double-PCA-based parameters in Figure 14c,d,\nshow a more effective normalization of the baseline features. Overall, both methods reduce**Figure 14.** Feature normalization for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based feature 3, ( **b** ) ARX–PCA–based\nfeature 36, ( **c** ) CWT–double–PCA-based feature 140, ( **d** ) CWT–double–PCA–based feature 266.To merge all the data obtained from the ARX and CWT methods, the Mahalanobis distance is implemented by applying a two-stage fusion process: in the first step, the\nfeatures from each sensor are merged and, in the second stage, the multi-sensor information is fused to enhance the sensibility to the damage. Therefore, in the first stage, Mahalanobis\ndistance transfers 468 CWT-double-PCA-based parameters into one column (173 × 1) for each sensor and train passage. At the same time, 80 ARX-PCA-based parameters are\nconverted to a single damage-sensitive feature (173 × 1). Figure 15 demonstrates theARX-PCA and CWT-double-PCA considering sensor 1. It is possible to observe that this process significantly improves damage detection sensitivity for both approaches.**Figure 15.** Features fusion for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based, ( **b** ) CWT–double–PCA–based.Afterwards, in the second stage, all sensor information is merged to improve the sensitivity to the damage even more.

As a result, a parametric study is carried out using\naccelerometers at distinct locations. In this analysis, only CWT is used for feature extraction because, as shown in Figure 17b, it is the best technique (with no false positives) compared(as presented in Figure 10) in terms of the total number (two, four, and six) are analyzed and the effectiveness of the detection methodology is demonstrated in Figure 18. The results concluded that even with two sensors (one on each side of the rail), the proposed**Figure 18.** Automatic polygonized wheel detection based on CWT technique considering: ( **a** ) sixIn the previous section, the proposed approach to detect a defective wheel from a healthy one was implemented for accelerometers located on the rail.

With the application of these intelligent techniques, it\nis not intended to completely replace the visual inspections already used for many decades,\nbut rather, the creation of a compatible procedure. Traditional visual inspection and control techniques are expensive, occur at intervals, and are prone to errors, it is important to\nmotivate the widespread use of Structural Integrity Monitoring (SIE) systems, especially in\nrecent infrastructures or in systems of high value to society, as in the case of railway systems . Thus, it is essential to develop automatic methodologies for detecting different Despite the widespread research on railway defect detection, to the knowledge of the authors, the reported literature on automatic wheel polygonization identification has been limited so far. Therefore, taking advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies, it isan early stage. The detection of polygonized wheels is largely carried out using accelerometers mounted on the vehicle.

The studies carriedidentifying singular irregularities on the wheel surface (i.e., wheel flat). In this context, itcomprehensive number of damages, namely the ones that may occur along the entire Several methods have been used for feature extraction, which converts time-series\ndata into more condensed information, allowing damage to be more easily observed.\nSymbolic data, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) [15–17], principal component analysis\n(PCA) , and autoregressive models [15–17] are examples of effective techniques for\nextracting damage-sensitive features for both static and dynamic monitoring.

CWT and PCA have been developed over decades in different applications, in both time and frequency domains with various sensors.

Typically, two different approaches are used: (i) unsupervised methods, in which models are trained using labeled data under the supervision of training data, such as k-means , self-organizing maps\n(SOM) , and cluster analysis; or (ii) supervised methods, in which models are not supervised using training datasets, such as Naive Bayes classifiers and k-Nearest Neighbor\nThis work aims: (i) to develop an unsupervised methodology to identify polygonized\nwheels; (ii) to evaluate the performance of different feature extraction techniques concerning their sensitivity to the detection of wheel polygonization, specifically those based on\nautoregressive exogenous models (ARX) and continuous wavelet transforms (CWT); (iii) towheel defect detection system.

In this sense, different simulations of realistic scenarios of dynamicconditions. On the other hand, to overcome some unpredictable oscillations in the measured responses and consequent failures in damage detection, some options can be taken.\nIn more complex structures, such as bridges and viaducts, there should be a greater susceptibility to damage when compared to areas of track sections on the foundation ground. If the structures are damaged, they may camouflage or cause false warnings. In a practical context, the use of sensors in an area of the track less prone to damage and where vibrationmethodology.

Moreover, ai, bk, ma, and mb are the parameters and the orders of the output and Initially, it is difficult to determine the most appropriate ARX model order. The key issue is that higher-order models could better match the data, but they may not generalize\nto other datasets. Otherwise, a low-order model is unlikely to capture the underlying physical system response. Several authors have noted the difficulty of defining a unique order for ARX models. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is reported to be one of the most effective optimization techniques . Based on the exchange between fit accuracy and the number of estimated parameters, AIC measures the goodness-of-fit of an estimatedparameters, respectively, and ε is the average sum-of-square residual ( SSR ) errors. To find out an optimum order, one should examine a wide range of orders and choose the orderStudies conducted by Li et al. showed good results in gearbox fault detection.\nCWT produces a two-dimensional set of coefficients from the analyzed signal. Although the Fourier transforms typically use sine waves as the basis for decomposition, other functionscan be selected for the wavelet shape due to signal properties. Two parameters define wavelet analysis: scale and translation. The CWT ( T ) of the signal x ( t ) is determined aswhere a and b are the scale and translation parameters, and ψ [∗] is the complex conjugate of the mother wavelet T that involves a continuous function in both time and frequency domains.\nAfter the implementation of a CWT on the evaluated signals, a PCA is performed\nfollowed by the extraction of four statistical parameters, resulting in significant data compression . Based on the p -by- q matrix X containing the extracted CWT features from the original signal evaluated by each sensor, where p is the measurement points number and q is the wavelets coefficients number, the principal components can be determinedwhere Ss represents the scores matrix, and T is a q -by- q orthonormal linear transformation matrix. In addition, four statistical parameters are extracted from the scores, Ss, including the root mean square (RMS), standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. Thus, a matrix p -by- q is transformed into a k -by- q matrix, where k equals 4. Consequently, a total of k × qenvironmental and operational variations (EOVs). For example, in damage detection, itare mostly sensitive to damage . Therefore, implementing a latent variable method,\nnamely the PCA, may efficiently reduce EOVs influences, without requiring the direct measurement of those effects. According to Bro and Smilde , PCA is a powerful and versatile method capable of providing an overview of complex multivariate data. PCA can be used to find and quantify patterns, generate new hypotheses, detect outliers, or find\nBy considering a m -by- f matrix X, taking into account features extracted from the dynamic responses, where m represents the train passages and f represents the number of\nfeatures extracted from sensors (i.e., k × q ), a transformation to another set of f features, Ss,\nis obtained by considering Equation (4). Considering the baseline condition, the covariance matrix ( C ) of the features is related to the covariance matrix of the scores Λ, as follows:where, Λ and T are matrices calculated by the singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix C . The columns of T are the eigenvectors and the diagonal matrix Λ, including\nthe eigenvalues of the matrix C in descending order. Thus, the eigenvalues stored in Λ areIt is possible to divide matrix Λ into two matrices with the first n eigenvalues and the remaining f-n eigenvalues. Determining the number of n -components is one of the\nchallenges in multivariate data interpretation. In this research study, n -components are\ndiscarded when the cumulative percentage of variance reaches 80% . Once n\nhas been selected, Equation (4) can be used to calculate the f-n components of matrix S. The transformation matrix T [ˆ] is constructed by the remaining f-n columns of matrix T . Using\nthe following function, the f-n components can be remapped to the main space:where, FPCA is m -by- f matrix of PCA features which is less sensitive to EOVs. Every sensorindex definition, is easy to implement and fast to process . For each simulation, the MD is considered to calculate a damage index (DI). Several damage identification studies haveDI . The MD is a well-known distance metric because it measures the distance\nbetween two points in a feature space containing two or more variables . Furthermore,\nit considers correlations between variables and does not depend on the scale of the features.\nIt can merge features from multiple sensors by performing data fusion. Mahalanobis\ndistance (namely here as DI ) is calculated by the following function:in which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−] , and is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The covariance matrix and mean vector intend to incorporate the baseline simulation. Based on the data derived from the\ndamaged system, a new observation would be far from the average of normal conditions.\nMahalanobis distances are calculated for each sensor and simulation. A matrix containing m Mahalanobis distances for i sensors is obtained from the above calculations.To automatically monitor train wheel conditions, the methodology performs outlier analysis.

Therefore,In real conditions, the wheels are not entirely smooth and have imperfections. Despite\ntheir small size, these out-of-roundness irregularities can cause extreme variations in the wheelrail contact forces, producing vibrations on the train and track components. A periodic radial\ntread irregularity around the wheel circumference characterizes the wheel polygonization.\nAccording to Peng , for wheel polygonization, the irregularity amplitudes should be higher than 0. mm. Inherent to polygonization, some parameters can geometrically characterize the phenomenon, such as the varying wavelengths (λ) in the function of the harmonic order (θ)Two groups of polygonal wheel profiles are generated for the numerical simulations,\none for undamaged scenarios and another for damaged scenarios, based on real wheel measurements, the irregularity amplitude spectra of which are presented in Figure 6.**Figure 6.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) ( **a** ) initial polygonalFor the first group of profiles, the measurement data obtained by Johansson et al.\nfor new wheels with wavelengths comprising 20 harmonics were used . Thebetween 0.135–2. m, being the upper limit of the perimeter of the wheel. For the second group of profiles, the measurement values for four wheels with polygonal damage obtained\nby Cai et al. were considered . The wheel pr i s are characterized by the\nwavelengths in the first 30 harmonics, with the 6th to 8th harmonic orders being dominant.\nThen, different irregularity wheel profiles are generated based on the sum of sine### w ( xw ) = ∑ Aθ sin [ψ] [θ]where Aθ is the amplitude of the sine function for each wavelength, which is calculated bywhere, as wre f = 1 µm. The wheel irregularity level ( Lw ) values are selected based on the\nirregularity spectrums of Figure 6, for both cases: initial polygonization or polygonal damage . Considering phase angles ( ψθ ) to the sine functions that are uniformly and randomly distributed between 0 and 2π, several wheel irregularities are In the case of polygonal damage, simulating different amplitudes are applied atobtain two different damage severities in the function of amplitude ranges, one between\n0. mm and 0. mm (a1) and the other between 0. mm and 1. mm (a2).

By observing these two figures, the difference inaround 0. mm and a damaged polygonal wheel with amplitudes between 0. mm and**Figure 7.** Example of an initial polygonization profile based on Figure 6a irregularity spectrum.**Figure 8.** Examples of polygonization-damaged profiles based on Figure 6b irregularity spectrumusing the in-house software VSI—Vehicle-Structure Interaction Analysis, which was validated and described in detail in the authors’ previous publication and was used in various of applications . In this model, the train is coupled to the track using a 3D wheel-rail contact model, using Hertzian theory to calculate the normal contact forces andsoftware. It is important to note that both subsystems are initially separately modeled in\nmodels via a fully coupled approach . The full explanation of the properties of\ntrack and train, including more details regarding train-track interaction, can be found in the authors’ previous publications . A graphical representation of the numerical model is shown in Figure 9. Note that the first wheel of the first wagon on the right side isA series of accelerometers are mounted along the track to detect a polygonized wheel.\nAccording to the results demonstrated in Mosleh et al. , the location of the most promising sensors for obtaining good results is on the rail. However, the possibility of placing the sensors on the sleepers was also analyzed, since their installation is much easier. Using a virtual wayside monitoring system, acceleration measurements were\nevaluated from 16 positions, as shown in Figure 10. In this figure, the numbers 1-to-4 andsleepers on the right and left sides, respectively, while the accelerations over the sleepers are measured by sensors located on positions 9-to-12 and 13-to-16. A virtual simulationautomatic wheel polygonized detection approach presented in this study. Once validated,Based on several speeds, loading schemes, and unevenness profiles of the rail, Table 3\nsummarizes the simulations of the undamaged and damaged scenarios. Baseline scenariosconsider vehicle speeds between 40 and 120 km/h, and four unevenness profiles are considered for rail irregularities . A total of six types of loading schemes are\nconsidered: (i) a fully loaded train, (ii) a half-loaded train, (iii) an empty train, and trains with an unbalanced load in the transversal and longitudinal directions, namely (iv) UNB1,\n(v) UNB2, and (vi) UNB3. In accordance with UIC loading guidelines , differentgravity is longitudinally and transversally offset. For baseline scenarios, 113 simulationswheels with initial polygonal profiles. Therefore, in addition to 113 analyses with healthy wheels, 30 scenarios are considered with three semi-imperfection cases, including: (i) the right wheel on the front wheelset of the first wagon, (ii) the left wheel of the rear wheelset of the third wagon; (iii) the right wheel of the rear wheelset of the fifth wagon. Furthermore,the front wheel on the right side of the first wagon as a polygonized wheel. These scenarioslow-pass Chebyshev type II digital filter.

The wheel with a semi-imperfection profile is located on the first wheel of the first wagon. This figure illustrates the similarity between the measured accelerations\nin each case due to the similar amplitude of healthy and semi-imperfection wheels.\nAcceleration time series at position 1 for damaged wheels are presented in Figure 11b,\nconsidering two different amplitudes of wheel irregularity profiles. By comparing the results from Figure 11a,b, it is evident that the acceleration variation for the healthy wheel\nis between − 1. to 2. m/s , while the defective one changes between − 70 to 100 m/s .**Figure 11.** Acceleration time-series on position 1 for ( **a** ) healthy wheel and wheel with semiimperfection profile, ( **b** ) damaged wheel.As the first step in the automatic damage detection method, damage-sensitive features are extracted from dynamic responses. As mentioned in Section 2.1, the ARX and CWT\nmodels are implemented and their performances as feature extractors are compared.\nTo establish a suitable ARX model order, AIC values are ascendingly ranked from\n1 to 70. An average AIC function is presented in Figure 12 based on 113 baseline analyses.\nIt is evident from this figure that after model order 40, the AIC values tend to stabilize,\nshowing that higher orders do not provide additional information. Therefore, the ARX models’ input and output orders are set to 40, and a total of 80 features are extracted. The\nsensor installed at position 5 ( yj in Equation (1)) is used as output, while each of the otherof the features extracted by the ARX models is higher than the CWT method.

In Figure 13b,c, a comparison of baseline and damaged scenarios shows similar variations in amplitude. In Figure 13d, the amplitude variation between healthy\nand damaged scenarios is evident, as the amplitude does not change much for the first\n143 passages, and then increases, which may indicate a wheel defect. Overall, the presenceregardless of the technique applied. Thus, the feature normalization step is implemented**Figure 13.** Feature extraction for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–feature 3, ( **b** ) ARX–feature 36, ( **c** ) CWT–featureout to obtain indicators that are more sensitive to damage and less sensitive to EOVs. The Latent Variable Method PCA is applied for data normalization. As explained in Section 5.1,\nfor all 173 train passages, 3-dimensional CWT-double-PCA-based feature matrices of\n173 × 468 are calculated for each sensor. At the same time, the ARX model is implementedsensor. Note that the PCA matrices have the same dimensions as the feature extraction step In Figure 14, the same four features shown in Figure 13 for sensor 1 are shown after\nimplementing PCA for all undamaged and damaged scenarios. During the modeling process, components with a cumulative percentage of variances higher than 80% are discarded. Therefore, the number of discarded rows is seventeen and two for CWT-doublePCA-based and ARX-PCA-based methods, respectively. The results obtained are quite\ndifferent depending on the method applied as a feature extractor. A reduction in theobserved in Figure 14a,b. However, CWT-double-PCA-based parameters in Figure 14c,d,\nshow a more effective normalization of the baseline features.

Therefore, in the first stage, Mahalanobis\ndistance transfers 468 CWT-double-PCA-based parameters into one column (173 × 1) for each sensor and train passage. At the same time, 80 ARX-PCA-based parameters are\nconverted to a single damage-sensitive feature (173 × 1). Figure 15 demonstrates theARX-PCA and CWT-double-PCA considering sensor 1. It is possible to observe that this process significantly improves damage detection sensitivity for both approaches.**Figure 15.** Features fusion for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based, ( **b** ) CWT–double–PCA–based.Afterwards, in the second stage, all sensor information is merged to improve the sensitivity to the damage even more.

Therefore, it is possible to conclude that using ARX models as feature extractors**Figure 17.** Automatic wheel defect detection ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based ( **b** ) CWT–double–PCA–based.To reduce the time of installation and maintenance costs, it is necessary to obtain an\noptimal number of sensors, as well as a suitable location to install them without compromising the quality of the detection. As a result, a parametric study is carried out using\naccelerometers at distinct locations. In this analysis, only CWT is used for feature extraction because, as shown in Figure 17b, it is the best technique (with no false positives) compared(as presented in Figure 10) in terms of the total number (two, four, and six) are analyzed and the effectiveness of the detection methodology is demonstrated in Figure 18. The results concluded that even with two sensors (one on each side of the rail), the proposed**Figure 18.** Automatic polygonized wheel detection based on CWT technique considering: ( **a** ) sixIn the previous section, the proposed approach to detect a defective wheel from a healthy one was implemented for accelerometers located on the rail.

Thus, it is essential to develop automatic methodologies for detecting different Despite the widespread research on railway defect detection, to the knowledge of the authors, the reported literature on automatic wheel polygonization identification has been limited so far. Therefore, taking advantage of artificial intelligence (AI) methodologies, it isan early stage. The detection of polygonized wheels is largely carried out using accelerometers mounted on the vehicle.

The studies carriedidentifying singular irregularities on the wheel surface (i.e., wheel flat). In this context, itcomprehensive number of damages, namely the ones that may occur along the entire Several methods have been used for feature extraction, which converts time-series\ndata into more condensed information, allowing damage to be more easily observed.\nSymbolic data, continuous wavelet transform (CWT) [15–17], principal component analysis\n(PCA) , and autoregressive models [15–17] are examples of effective techniques for\nextracting damage-sensitive features for both static and dynamic monitoring.

On the other hand, to overcome some unpredictable oscillations in the measured responses and consequent failures in damage detection, some options can be taken.\nIn more complex structures, such as bridges and viaducts, there should be a greater susceptibility to damage when compared to areas of track sections on the foundation ground.

The key issue is that higher-order models could better match the data, but they may not generalize\nto other datasets. Otherwise, a low-order model is unlikely to capture the underlying physical system response. Several authors have noted the difficulty of defining a unique order for ARX models. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is reported to be one of the most effective optimization techniques . Based on the exchange between fit accuracy and the number of estimated parameters, AIC measures the goodness-of-fit of an estimatedparameters, respectively, and ε is the average sum-of-square residual ( SSR ) errors. To find out an optimum order, one should examine a wide range of orders and choose the orderStudies conducted by Li et al. showed good results in gearbox fault detection.\nCWT produces a two-dimensional set of coefficients from the analyzed signal.

In addition, four statistical parameters are extracted from the scores, Ss, including the root mean square (RMS), standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. Thus, a matrix p -by- q is transformed into a k -by- q matrix, where k equals 4. Consequently, a total of k × qenvironmental and operational variations (EOVs). For example, in damage detection, itare mostly sensitive to damage . Therefore, implementing a latent variable method,\nnamely the PCA, may efficiently reduce EOVs influences, without requiring the direct measurement of those effects. According to Bro and Smilde , PCA is a powerful and versatile method capable of providing an overview of complex multivariate data. PCA can be used to find and quantify patterns, generate new hypotheses, detect outliers, or find\nBy considering a m -by- f matrix X, taking into account features extracted from the dynamic responses, where m represents the train passages and f represents the number of\nfeatures extracted from sensors (i.e., k × q ), a transformation to another set of f features, Ss,\nis obtained by considering Equation (4). Considering the baseline condition, the covariance matrix ( C ) of the features is related to the covariance matrix of the scores Λ, as follows:where, Λ and T are matrices calculated by the singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix C . The columns of T are the eigenvectors and the diagonal matrix Λ, including\nthe eigenvalues of the matrix C in descending order. Thus, the eigenvalues stored in Λ areIt is possible to divide matrix Λ into two matrices with the first n eigenvalues and the remaining f-n eigenvalues. Determining the number of n -components is one of the\nchallenges in multivariate data interpretation. In this research study, n -components are\ndiscarded when the cumulative percentage of variance reaches 80% . Once n\nhas been selected, Equation (4) can be used to calculate the f-n components of matrix S. The transformation matrix T [ˆ] is constructed by the remaining f-n columns of matrix T . Using\nthe following function, the f-n components can be remapped to the main space:where, FPCA is m -by- f matrix of PCA features which is less sensitive to EOVs. Every sensorindex definition, is easy to implement and fast to process . For each simulation, the MD is considered to calculate a damage index (DI). Several damage identification studies haveDI . The MD is a well-known distance metric because it measures the distance\nbetween two points in a feature space containing two or more variables . Furthermore,\nit considers correlations between variables and does not depend on the scale of the features.\nIt can merge features from multiple sensors by performing data fusion. Mahalanobis\ndistance (namely here as DI ) is calculated by the following function:in which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−] , and is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The covariance matrix and mean vector intend to incorporate the baseline simulation. Based on the data derived from the\ndamaged system, a new observation would be far from the average of normal conditions.\nMahalanobis distances are calculated for each sensor and simulation. A matrix containing m Mahalanobis distances for i sensors is obtained from the above calculations.To automatically monitor train wheel conditions, the methodology performs outlier analysis. In Meixedo et al. and Mosleh et al. , this tool proved to be very efficient in\nclassifying the data as being related to a scenario with or without damage. Mahalanobisspace. A Gaussian distribution can be used to approximate the Mahalanobis distance, and statistical thresholds can be used to analyze outliers. By considering a mean value and standard deviation σ of the baseline feature vector, as well as the significance level α, itconsequently, when DI is equal to or higher than CB, a feature is considered to be an outlier.In the present research, the Laagrss freight train composed of five wagons is studied.\nAccording to the UIC classification, it can reach a top speed of 120 km/h . Each wagon has a tare weight of 27 t and can carry loads up to 52 t. A double freight wagon is shown incomponent. A rigid beam element was also used to connect the above-mentioned components.

The model is based on a multi-layer scheme,\nsimulating the ballast, sleepers, and rails, as shown in Figure 4. The railpads, resting on the sleepers under the rail, are simulated as spring elements connecting the sleepers and\nrail. The mass of the ballast is represented by elements of discrete mass points, while the\nrails and sleepers are modeled using beam elements, adopting the appropriate material properties for each one. Finally, spring-dashpot elements are also incorporated to consider\nfoundation flexibility. Table 2 presents the properties of the track model.ties are very small, their effects on wheel-rail contact cannot be neglected . Therefore,In real conditions, the wheels are not entirely smooth and have imperfections. Despite\ntheir small size, these out-of-roundness irregularities can cause extreme variations in the wheelrail contact forces, producing vibrations on the train and track components. A periodic radial\ntread irregularity around the wheel circumference characterizes the wheel polygonization.\nAccording to Peng , for wheel polygonization, the irregularity amplitudes should be higher than 0. mm. Inherent to polygonization, some parameters can geometrically characterize the phenomenon, such as the varying wavelengths (λ) in the function of the harmonic order (θ)Two groups of polygonal wheel profiles are generated for the numerical simulations,\none for undamaged scenarios and another for damaged scenarios, based on real wheel measurements, the irregularity amplitude spectra of which are presented in Figure 6.**Figure 6.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) ( **a** ) initial polygonalFor the first group of profiles, the measurement data obtained by Johansson et al.\nfor new wheels with wavelengths comprising 20 harmonics were used . Thebetween 0.135–2. m, being the upper limit of the perimeter of the wheel. For the second group of profiles, the measurement values for four wheels with polygonal damage obtained\nby Cai et al. were considered . The wheel pr i s are characterized by the\nwavelengths in the first 30 harmonics, with the 6th to 8th harmonic orders being dominant.\nThen, different irregularity wheel profiles are generated based on the sum of sine### w ( xw ) = ∑ Aθ sin [ψ] [θ]where Aθ is the amplitude of the sine function for each wavelength, which is calculated bywhere, as wre f = 1 µm. The wheel irregularity level ( Lw ) values are selected based on the\nirregularity spectrums of Figure 6, for both cases: initial polygonization or polygonal damage . Considering phase angles ( ψθ ) to the sine functions that are uniformly and randomly distributed between 0 and 2π, several wheel irregularities are In the case of polygonal damage, simulating different amplitudes are applied atobtain two different damage severities in the function of amplitude ranges, one between\n0. mm and 0. mm (a1) and the other between 0. mm and 1. mm (a2).

In this model, the train is coupled to the track using a 3D wheel-rail contact model, using Hertzian theory to calculate the normal contact forces andsoftware. It is important to note that both subsystems are initially separately modeled in\nmodels via a fully coupled approach . The full explanation of the properties of\ntrack and train, including more details regarding train-track interaction, can be found in the authors’ previous publications . A graphical representation of the numerical model is shown in Figure 9. Note that the first wheel of the first wagon on the right side isA series of accelerometers are mounted along the track to detect a polygonized wheel.\nAccording to the results demonstrated in Mosleh et al. , the location of the most promising sensors for obtaining good results is on the rail. However, the possibility of placing the sensors on the sleepers was also analyzed, since their installation is much easier. Using a virtual wayside monitoring system, acceleration measurements were\nevaluated from 16 positions, as shown in Figure 10. In this figure, the numbers 1-to-4 andsleepers on the right and left sides, respectively, while the accelerations over the sleepers are measured by sensors located on positions 9-to-12 and 13-to-16.

Once validated,Based on several speeds, loading schemes, and unevenness profiles of the rail, Table 3\nsummarizes the simulations of the undamaged and damaged scenarios. Baseline scenariosconsider vehicle speeds between 40 and 120 km/h, and four unevenness profiles are considered for rail irregularities . A total of six types of loading schemes are\nconsidered: (i) a fully loaded train, (ii) a half-loaded train, (iii) an empty train, and trains with an unbalanced load in the transversal and longitudinal directions, namely (iv) UNB1,\n(v) UNB2, and (vi) UNB3. In accordance with UIC loading guidelines , differentgravity is longitudinally and transversally offset. For baseline scenarios, 113 simulationswheels with initial polygonal profiles. Therefore, in addition to 113 analyses with healthy wheels, 30 scenarios are considered with three semi-imperfection cases, including: (i) the right wheel on the front wheelset of the first wagon, (ii) the left wheel of the rear wheelset of the third wagon; (iii) the right wheel of the rear wheelset of the fifth wagon.

The wheel with a semi-imperfection profile is located on the first wheel of the first wagon. This figure illustrates the similarity between the measured accelerations\nin each case due to the similar amplitude of healthy and semi-imperfection wheels.\nAcceleration time series at position 1 for damaged wheels are presented in Figure 11b,\nconsidering two different amplitudes of wheel irregularity profiles. By comparing the results from Figure 11a,b, it is evident that the acceleration variation for the healthy wheel\nis between − 1. to 2. m/s , while the defective one changes between − 70 to 100 m/s .**Figure 11.** Acceleration time-series on position 1 for ( **a** ) healthy wheel and wheel with semiimperfection profile, ( **b** ) damaged wheel.As the first step in the automatic damage detection method, damage-sensitive features are extracted from dynamic responses. As mentioned in Section 2.1, the ARX and CWT\nmodels are implemented and their performances as feature extractors are compared.\nTo establish a suitable ARX model order, AIC values are ascendingly ranked from\n1 to 70. An average AIC function is presented in Figure 12 based on 113 baseline analyses.\nIt is evident from this figure that after model order 40, the AIC values tend to stabilize,\nshowing that higher orders do not provide additional information. Therefore, the ARX models’ input and output orders are set to 40, and a total of 80 features are extracted. The\nsensor installed at position 5 ( yj in Equation (1)) is used as output, while each of the otherof the features extracted by the ARX models is higher than the CWT method.

In Figure 13b,c, a comparison of baseline and damaged scenarios shows similar variations in amplitude. In Figure 13d, the amplitude variation between healthy\nand damaged scenarios is evident, as the amplitude does not change much for the first\n143 passages, and then increases, which may indicate a wheel defect. Overall, the presenceregardless of the technique applied. Thus, the feature normalization step is implemented**Figure 13.** Feature extraction for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–feature 3, ( **b** ) ARX–feature 36, ( **c** ) CWT–featureout to obtain indicators that are more sensitive to damage and less sensitive to EOVs. The Latent Variable Method PCA is applied for data normalization. As explained in Section 5.1,\nfor all 173 train passages, 3-dimensional CWT-double-PCA-based feature matrices of\n173 × 468 are calculated for each sensor. At the same time, the ARX model is implementedsensor. Note that the PCA matrices have the same dimensions as the feature extraction step In Figure 14, the same four features shown in Figure 13 for sensor 1 are shown after\nimplementing PCA for all undamaged and damaged scenarios. During the modeling process, components with a cumulative percentage of variances higher than 80% are discarded. Therefore, the number of discarded rows is seventeen and two for CWT-doublePCA-based and ARX-PCA-based methods, respectively. The results obtained are quite\ndifferent depending on the method applied as a feature extractor. A reduction in theobserved in Figure 14a,b. However, CWT-double-PCA-based parameters in Figure 14c,d,\nshow a more effective normalization of the baseline features. Overall, both methods reduce**Figure 14.** Feature normalization for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based feature 3, ( **b** ) ARX–PCA–based\nfeature 36, ( **c** ) CWT–double–PCA-based feature 140, ( **d** ) CWT–double–PCA–based feature 266.To merge all the data obtained from the ARX and CWT methods, the Mahalanobis distance is implemented by applying a two-stage fusion process: in the first step, the\nfeatures from each sensor are merged and, in the second stage, the multi-sensor information is fused to enhance the sensibility to the damage. Therefore, in the first stage, Mahalanobis\ndistance transfers 468 CWT-double-PCA-based parameters into one column (173 × 1) for each sensor and train passage. At the same time, 80 ARX-PCA-based parameters are\nconverted to a single damage-sensitive feature (173 × 1). Figure 15 demonstrates theARX-PCA and CWT-double-PCA considering sensor 1. It is possible to observe that this process significantly improves damage detection sensitivity for both approaches.**Figure 15.** Features fusion for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based, ( **b** ) CWT–double–PCA–based.Afterwards, in the second stage, all sensor information is merged to improve the sensitivity to the damage even more.

Therefore, it is possible to conclude that using ARX models as feature extractors**Figure 17.** Automatic wheel defect detection ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based ( **b** ) CWT–double–PCA–based.To reduce the time of installation and maintenance costs, it is necessary to obtain an\noptimal number of sensors, as well as a suitable location to install them without compromising the quality of the detection. As a result, a parametric study is carried out using\naccelerometers at distinct locations. In this analysis, only CWT is used for feature extraction because, as shown in Figure 17b, it is the best technique (with no false positives) compared(as presented in Figure 10) in terms of the total number (two, four, and six) are analyzed and the effectiveness of the detection methodology is demonstrated in Figure 18. The results concluded that even with two sensors (one on each side of the rail), the proposed**Figure 18.** Automatic polygonized wheel detection based on CWT technique considering: ( **a** ) sixIn the previous section, the proposed approach to detect a defective wheel from a healthy one was implemented for accelerometers located on the rail.

Typically, two different approaches are used: (i) unsupervised methods, in which models are trained using labeled data under the supervision of training data, such as k-means , self-organizing maps\n(SOM) , and cluster analysis; or (ii) supervised methods, in which models are not supervised using training datasets, such as Naive Bayes classifiers and k-Nearest Neighbor\nThis work aims: (i) to develop an unsupervised methodology to identify polygonized\nwheels; (ii) to evaluate the performance of different feature extraction techniques concerning their sensitivity to the detection of wheel polygonization, specifically those based on\nautoregressive exogenous models (ARX) and continuous wavelet transforms (CWT); (iii) towheel defect detection system. The unsupervised methodology to identify polygonized wheels consists of five phases: (i) data acquisition, (ii) feature extraction, (iii) feature The acquired track responses are influenced by parameters such as speed, irregularities, and load types. In this sense, different simulations of realistic scenarios of dynamicconditions. On the other hand, to overcome some unpredictable oscillations in the measured responses and consequent failures in damage detection, some options can be taken.\nIn more complex structures, such as bridges and viaducts, there should be a greater susceptibility to damage when compared to areas of track sections on the foundation ground. If the structures are damaged, they may camouflage or cause false warnings. In a practical context, the use of sensors in an area of the track less prone to damage and where vibrationmethodology. Aligned on these assumptions, the location of the sensors was chosen on aAfter defining the AI approach for identifying wheel polygonization, two distinguished feature extraction methods, namely ARX and CWT, are compared. To avoid\nfalse alarm situations caused by environmental and operational effects, the latent variable method Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is applied. To reduce the volume of extracted data while retaining the most relevant information, as well as improve the ability to characterize the measured phenomenon, the data are merged using the Mahalanobis distance. As\na final step, an outlier analysis is employed to automatically distinguish a healthy wheel It should be highlighted that wheel flat identification was developed by Mosleh et al. ,\nwho demonstrated that the methodology is able to identify wheel flats. The validation of the proposed AI-based methodology herein, considering a polygonal wheel, is a clear step forward\nin terms of the proposed methodology’s effectiveness, allowing for a complete implementation**2.

By using the Mahalanobis distance, the features from each sensor can be effectively merged in the first stage. Moreover, a new Mahalanobis distance is applied\nagain in the second stage to integrate all sensor information. The outcome of this stepDI identifies a healthy or a defective wheel; a statistical confidence boundary (CB) isIn this study, the features are extracted based on autoregressive models with exogenous inputs (ARX) and continuous wavelet transform (CWT) models. The performance ofthe occurrence of gearbox failures. The ARX autoregressive model considers the predictive behavior of the system at a specific location, considering its history at the same\npoint and the predictive response at other measurement locations, being defined by the### xj = ∑ aixj−i +### ∑ bkyj−k + ε j (1)where xj, yj, and ε j are the output, input, as well as error term of the model at the signal value j . Moreover, ai, bk, ma, and mb are the parameters and the orders of the output and Initially, it is difficult to determine the most appropriate ARX model order. The key issue is that higher-order models could better match the data, but they may not generalize\nto other datasets. Otherwise, a low-order model is unlikely to capture the underlying physical system response. Several authors have noted the difficulty of defining a unique order for ARX models. The Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) is reported to be one of the most effective optimization techniques . Based on the exchange between fit accuracy and the number of estimated parameters, AIC measures the goodness-of-fit of an estimatedparameters, respectively, and ε is the average sum-of-square residual ( SSR ) errors. To find out an optimum order, one should examine a wide range of orders and choose the orderStudies conducted by Li et al. showed good results in gearbox fault detection.\nCWT produces a two-dimensional set of coefficients from the analyzed signal. Although the Fourier transforms typically use sine waves as the basis for decomposition, other functionscan be selected for the wavelet shape due to signal properties. Two parameters define wavelet analysis: scale and translation. The CWT ( T ) of the signal x ( t ) is determined aswhere a and b are the scale and translation parameters, and ψ [∗] is the complex conjugate of the mother wavelet T that involves a continuous function in both time and frequency domains.\nAfter the implementation of a CWT on the evaluated signals, a PCA is performed\nfollowed by the extraction of four statistical parameters, resulting in significant data compression . Based on the p -by- q matrix X containing the extracted CWT features from the original signal evaluated by each sensor, where p is the measurement points number and q is the wavelets coefficients number, the principal components can be determinedwhere Ss represents the scores matrix, and T is a q -by- q orthonormal linear transformation matrix. In addition, four statistical parameters are extracted from the scores, Ss, including the root mean square (RMS), standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis. Thus, a matrix p -by- q is transformed into a k -by- q matrix, where k equals 4. Consequently, a total of k × qenvironmental and operational variations (EOVs). For example, in damage detection, itare mostly sensitive to damage . Therefore, implementing a latent variable method,\nnamely the PCA, may efficiently reduce EOVs influences, without requiring the direct measurement of those effects. According to Bro and Smilde , PCA is a powerful and versatile method capable of providing an overview of complex multivariate data. PCA can be used to find and quantify patterns, generate new hypotheses, detect outliers, or find\nBy considering a m -by- f matrix X, taking into account features extracted from the dynamic responses, where m represents the train passages and f represents the number of\nfeatures extracted from sensors (i.e., k × q ), a transformation to another set of f features, Ss,\nis obtained by considering Equation (4). Considering the baseline condition, the covariance matrix ( C ) of the features is related to the covariance matrix of the scores Λ, as follows:where, Λ and T are matrices calculated by the singular value decomposition of the covariance matrix C . The columns of T are the eigenvectors and the diagonal matrix Λ, including\nthe eigenvalues of the matrix C in descending order. Thus, the eigenvalues stored in Λ areIt is possible to divide matrix Λ into two matrices with the first n eigenvalues and the remaining f-n eigenvalues. Determining the number of n -components is one of the\nchallenges in multivariate data interpretation. In this research study, n -components are\ndiscarded when the cumulative percentage of variance reaches 80% . Once n\nhas been selected, Equation (4) can be used to calculate the f-n components of matrix S. The transformation matrix T [ˆ] is constructed by the remaining f-n columns of matrix T . Using\nthe following function, the f-n components can be remapped to the main space:where, FPCA is m -by- f matrix of PCA features which is less sensitive to EOVs. Every sensorindex definition, is easy to implement and fast to process . For each simulation, the MD is considered to calculate a damage index (DI). Several damage identification studies haveDI . The MD is a well-known distance metric because it measures the distance\nbetween two points in a feature space containing two or more variables . Furthermore,\nit considers correlations between variables and does not depend on the scale of the features.\nIt can merge features from multiple sensors by performing data fusion. Mahalanobis\ndistance (namely here as DI ) is calculated by the following function:in which, the inverse covariance matrix of the baseline simulation is defined by C [−] , and is a mean vector of the features from the baseline simulation. The test vector of f features\nrepresenting the potential damage is defined by xi . The covariance matrix and mean vector intend to incorporate the baseline simulation. Based on the data derived from the\ndamaged system, a new observation would be far from the average of normal conditions.\nMahalanobis distances are calculated for each sensor and simulation. A matrix containing m Mahalanobis distances for i sensors is obtained from the above calculations.To automatically monitor train wheel conditions, the methodology performs outlier analysis. In Meixedo et al. and Mosleh et al. , this tool proved to be very efficient in\nclassifying the data as being related to a scenario with or without damage. Mahalanobisspace. A Gaussian distribution can be used to approximate the Mahalanobis distance, and statistical thresholds can be used to analyze outliers. By considering a mean value and standard deviation σ of the baseline feature vector, as well as the significance level α, itconsequently, when DI is equal to or higher than CB, a feature is considered to be an outlier.In the present research, the Laagrss freight train composed of five wagons is studied.\nAccording to the UIC classification, it can reach a top speed of 120 km/h . Each wagon has a tare weight of 27 t and can carry loads up to 52 t. A double freight wagon is shown incomponent. A rigid beam element was also used to connect the above-mentioned components. The numerical model of the vehicle is presented in Figure 3 and the mechanicaland geometric properties of the vehicle are detailed in Table 1.

The model is based on a multi-layer scheme,\nsimulating the ballast, sleepers, and rails, as shown in Figure 4. The railpads, resting on the sleepers under the rail, are simulated as spring elements connecting the sleepers and\nrail. The mass of the ballast is represented by elements of discrete mass points, while the\nrails and sleepers are modeled using beam elements, adopting the appropriate material properties for each one. Finally, spring-dashpot elements are also incorporated to consider\nfoundation flexibility. Table 2 presents the properties of the track model.ties are very small, their effects on wheel-rail contact cannot be neglected . Therefore,In real conditions, the wheels are not entirely smooth and have imperfections. Despite\ntheir small size, these out-of-roundness irregularities can cause extreme variations in the wheelrail contact forces, producing vibrations on the train and track components. A periodic radial\ntread irregularity around the wheel circumference characterizes the wheel polygonization.\nAccording to Peng , for wheel polygonization, the irregularity amplitudes should be higher than 0. mm. Inherent to polygonization, some parameters can geometrically characterize the phenomenon, such as the varying wavelengths (λ) in the function of the harmonic order (θ)Two groups of polygonal wheel profiles are generated for the numerical simulations,\none for undamaged scenarios and another for damaged scenarios, based on real wheel measurements, the irregularity amplitude spectra of which are presented in Figure 6.**Figure 6.** Wheel irregularity amplitude spectra ( Lw ) and harmonic order ( θ ) ( **a** ) initial polygonalFor the first group of profiles, the measurement data obtained by Johansson et al.\nfor new wheels with wavelengths comprising 20 harmonics were used . Thebetween 0.135–2. m, being the upper limit of the perimeter of the wheel. For the second group of profiles, the measurement values for four wheels with polygonal damage obtained\nby Cai et al. were considered . The wheel pr i s are characterized by the\nwavelengths in the first 30 harmonics, with the 6th to 8th harmonic orders being dominant.\nThen, different irregularity wheel profiles are generated based on the sum of sine### w ( xw ) = ∑ Aθ sin [ψ] [θ]where Aθ is the amplitude of the sine function for each wavelength, which is calculated bywhere, as wre f = 1 µm. The wheel irregularity level ( Lw ) values are selected based on the\nirregularity spectrums of Figure 6, for both cases: initial polygonization or polygonal damage . Considering phase angles ( ψθ ) to the sine functions that are uniformly and randomly distributed between 0 and 2π, several wheel irregularities are In the case of polygonal damage, simulating different amplitudes are applied atobtain two different damage severities in the function of amplitude ranges, one between\n0. mm and 0. mm (a1) and the other between 0. mm and 1. mm (a2).

In this model, the train is coupled to the track using a 3D wheel-rail contact model, using Hertzian theory to calculate the normal contact forces andsoftware.

A graphical representation of the numerical model is shown in Figure 9. Note that the first wheel of the first wagon on the right side isA series of accelerometers are mounted along the track to detect a polygonized wheel.\nAccording to the results demonstrated in Mosleh et al. , the location of the most promising sensors for obtaining good results is on the rail. However, the possibility of placing the sensors on the sleepers was also analyzed, since their installation is much easier. Using a virtual wayside monitoring system, acceleration measurements were\nevaluated from 16 positions, as shown in Figure 10. In this figure, the numbers 1-to-4 andsleepers on the right and left sides, respectively, while the accelerations over the sleepers are measured by sensors located on positions 9-to-12 and 13-to-16.

Once validated,Based on several speeds, loading schemes, and unevenness profiles of the rail, Table 3\nsummarizes the simulations of the undamaged and damaged scenarios. Baseline scenariosconsider vehicle speeds between 40 and 120 km/h, and four unevenness profiles are considered for rail irregularities . A total of six types of loading schemes are\nconsidered: (i) a fully loaded train, (ii) a half-loaded train, (iii) an empty train, and trains with an unbalanced load in the transversal and longitudinal directions, namely (iv) UNB1,\n(v) UNB2, and (vi) UNB3. In accordance with UIC loading guidelines , differentgravity is longitudinally and transversally offset. For baseline scenarios, 113 simulationswheels with initial polygonal profiles. Therefore, in addition to 113 analyses with healthy wheels, 30 scenarios are considered with three semi-imperfection cases, including: (i) the right wheel on the front wheelset of the first wagon, (ii) the left wheel of the rear wheelset of the third wagon; (iii) the right wheel of the rear wheelset of the fifth wagon.

This figure illustrates the similarity between the measured accelerations\nin each case due to the similar amplitude of healthy and semi-imperfection wheels.\nAcceleration time series at position 1 for damaged wheels are presented in Figure 11b,\nconsidering two different amplitudes of wheel irregularity profiles. By comparing the results from Figure 11a,b, it is evident that the acceleration variation for the healthy wheel\nis between − 1. to 2. m/s , while the defective one changes between − 70 to 100 m/s .**Figure 11.** Acceleration time-series on position 1 for ( **a** ) healthy wheel and wheel with semiimperfection profile, ( **b** ) damaged wheel.As the first step in the automatic damage detection method, damage-sensitive features are extracted from dynamic responses. As mentioned in Section 2.1, the ARX and CWT\nmodels are implemented and their performances as feature extractors are compared.\nTo establish a suitable ARX model order, AIC values are ascendingly ranked from\n1 to 70. An average AIC function is presented in Figure 12 based on 113 baseline analyses.\nIt is evident from this figure that after model order 40, the AIC values tend to stabilize,\nshowing that higher orders do not provide additional information. Therefore, the ARX models’ input and output orders are set to 40, and a total of 80 features are extracted. The\nsensor installed at position 5 ( yj in Equation (1)) is used as output, while each of the otherof the features extracted by the ARX models is higher than the CWT method.

Overall, the presenceregardless of the technique applied. Thus, the feature normalization step is implemented**Figure 13.** Feature extraction for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–feature 3, ( **b** ) ARX–feature 36, ( **c** ) CWT–featureout to obtain indicators that are more sensitive to damage and less sensitive to EOVs. The Latent Variable Method PCA is applied for data normalization. As explained in Section 5.1,\nfor all 173 train passages, 3-dimensional CWT-double-PCA-based feature matrices of\n173 × 468 are calculated for each sensor. At the same time, the ARX model is implementedsensor. Note that the PCA matrices have the same dimensions as the feature extraction step In Figure 14, the same four features shown in Figure 13 for sensor 1 are shown after\nimplementing PCA for all undamaged and damaged scenarios. During the modeling process, components with a cumulative percentage of variances higher than 80% are discarded. Therefore, the number of discarded rows is seventeen and two for CWT-doublePCA-based and ARX-PCA-based methods, respectively. The results obtained are quite\ndifferent depending on the method applied as a feature extractor. A reduction in theobserved in Figure 14a,b. However, CWT-double-PCA-based parameters in Figure 14c,d,\nshow a more effective normalization of the baseline features.

Therefore, in the first stage, Mahalanobis\ndistance transfers 468 CWT-double-PCA-based parameters into one column (173 × 1) for each sensor and train passage. At the same time, 80 ARX-PCA-based parameters are\nconverted to a single damage-sensitive feature (173 × 1). Figure 15 demonstrates theARX-PCA and CWT-double-PCA considering sensor 1. It is possible to observe that this process significantly improves damage detection sensitivity for both approaches.**Figure 15.** Features fusion for sensor 1, ( **a** ) ARX–PCA–based, ( **b** ) CWT–double–PCA–based.Afterwards, in the second stage, all sensor information is merged to improve the sensitivity to the damage even more.

As a result, a parametric study is carried out using\naccelerometers at distinct locations. In this analysis, only CWT is used for feature extraction because, as shown in Figure 17b, it is the best technique (with no false positives) compared(as presented in Figure 10) in terms of the total number (two, four, and six) are analyzed and the effectiveness of the detection methodology is demonstrated in Figure 18. The results concluded that even with two sensors (one on each side of the rail), the proposed**Figure 18.** Automatic polygonized wheel detection based on CWT technique considering: ( **a** ) sixIn the previous section, the proposed approach to detect a defective wheel from a healthy one was implemented for accelerometers located on the rail.
