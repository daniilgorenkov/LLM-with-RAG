It is responsible for supporting the weight of the train, transmitting traction, ensuring stability and guidance on the tracks. One of the most common problems with train wheels is out-of-roundness (OOR), which can result in rail damage and sleeper cracking, as well as high-cycle fatigue of wheels and other vehicle components (X.

It may further increase the likelihood of derailment and deteriorate ride comfort (X.-Z. Liu, 2019). In 2018, PT Kereta Api Indonesia (Persero), a leading railway operator in Indonesia, experienced a derailment, with wheelset OOR being one of the causes (Komite Nasional Keselamatan Transportasi Republik Indonesia, 2018).
