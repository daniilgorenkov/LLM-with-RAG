{"text": "g models is a challenge, because in the actual world, fault data from sensor monitoring will almost likely be less than normal condition monitoring data (unbalanced data). Furthermore, research into the application of machine learning-vibration techniques to identify several train wheel OOR faults is required to determine the optimal machine learning method. This type of study can also include railway operator industries, increasing train wheel maintenance strategies more effective and efficient.## **REFERENCES**Jurnal Dinamika Vokasional Teknik Mesin, Volume.
