Rail accidents were occasionally caused by failures such as severe defects or fatigue of railway components. To maintain a good service quality and operation safety, it is paramount to develop\nonline monitoring techniques that not only quickly recognize faults of mission-critical HSR components but also can anticipate of long-term mechanisms and gradual deterioration in performance.\nWheelsets in a high-speed train are physically connected with and controlled by the bogie system which corrects alignment for stable running and reduces the vibration caused by wheel-rail interaction . However, the wheel performance\nprogressively deteriorates in different mechanisms (e.g., wheel flat and wheel polygonization) during the routine operation of a high-speed train . Wheel performance deterioration increases stresses experienced by the bogie system. In addition,\nthe increased stress within bogie frames caused by wheel quality deterioration can be unexpectedly large, thus posing a serious threat to the operation safety of concerned trains. According to the statistics of train accidents caused by failure in\nmechanical components during 2004 to 2007 in the United States, the wheelsets faults are the most cause with a rate of\n44.7% . Therefore, the railway managers are keen to keep wheels in an adequate condition and detect potential failure\nas soon as possible. For railway wheels, there are three different ways of estimating the conditions: physical modeling, statistical modeling and condition monitoring . However, the first two ways are not applicable to in-service\nwheel condition assessment, and in contrast, the third way is most feasible for wheel condition estimation. The monitoring approaches available to wheel defect detection can be divided into in-workshop inspection and in-service detection . The\nlatter provides the real-time data required for maintenance planning, while the former is normally carried out at workshops at fixed intervals. The commonly used in-workshop methods for wheel defect inspection include the ultrasonic techniques, infrared camera and magnetic methods . In-service monitoring approaches can be categorized as on-board and wayside methods. The on-board methods implement sensors on the train and continuously obtain comprehensive data from\nthe system. The methods of this category include magnetic technique , ultrasonic technique , acoustic technique, and vibration technique . On the other hand, wayside methods attempt to detect the wheel or vehicle performance\nby installing sensors on the rail or its surrounding areas. Such indirect measurements give rise to limited information of the wheel condition while they can monitor all train wheels going by with using only one or a few sensors. According to the type\nof sensors used, wayside detection approaches include strain sensing technology , fiber optic sensing technology ,\nultrasonic technique , vibration technique , acoustic emission , lasers and high-speed cameras . However,\nthe study on data interpretation techniques enabling the extraction of defect-sensitive features is far from sufficient.\nBayesian dynamic linear model (DLM) is an elegant system approach to handling time series data from a Bayesian perspective, which originates from the field of applied statistics and is extensively used in other fields such as economics\nand engineering [25–30]. The Bayesian DLM treats the time series as the output of a dynamic system perturbed by random disturbances. It is suitable for modeling both univariate and multivariate time series, and also for representing the structural changes, non-stationarity and irregular patterns . Unlike the classical time series method which assumes a fixed relationship between the dependent variables (response variables) and the independent variables (regressors), the DLM considers\nthe relationship changes over time and is able to directly capture time series data features, such as trend, seasonality,\nand regression effects. Moreover, the DLM allows for descriptions of temporary or permanent shifts in time series parameters that occur abruptly, which are necessary for outlier and damage detection in structural health monitoring (SHM) paradigms. Recently, Goulet and his collaborator adopted the Bayesian DLM theory in SHM to model the time-dependent\nresponses of structures by breaking them into subcomponents. In the perspective of real-time damage detection, only few studies are available. The first attempt was conducted by Lipowsky et al. with the development of a Bayesian DLM-based\nreal-time detection algorithm to evaluate the performance of a gas turbine using simulated data. Later on, Wang et al.\nand Zhang et al. adopted the above algorithm for detecting high-speed train defects by using real-world monitoring\ndata. In the previous studies, however, the real-time detection algorithm devised possesses only outlier identification and\nchange detection abilities, without the function of damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.context of Bayesian DLM, which incorporates logics for prognosis, potential outlier detection, identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and damage extent and uncertainty quantification. The Bayesian DLM is considered as a tool\nfor time series analysis, while Bayesian forecasting is executed to enable the calculation of one-step ahead forecast distribution. The change-point detection is performed by checking the current observation against the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM for current instant) as well as against an alternative model of which the mean value\nis shifted by a prescribed offset. The detection rule is that if the alternative model better fits the actual observation, a potential change is signaled. To further determine whether such an observation is only an outlier or the beginning of an actual\nchange (change-point), a specific logic is developed by introducing the Bayes factor and the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.\nThe main contributions of this study are the provision of: (i) a formula which not only enables the modeling of actual framework; (ii) three metrics (i.e., the Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) to allow for outlier\nand change-point detection in real-time manner; and (iii) an efficient way for damage extent assessment and uncertainty\nquantification. The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the Bayesian DLM theory and an elaboration of the Bayesian forecasting philosophy. Section 3 presents the defect detection methodology that incorporates logics for\noutlier detection, change-point identification, and damage assessment. In Section 4, two case studies making use of timeseries strain data acquired by fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors affixed on the bogies of an in-service high-speed train are offered to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the proposed methodology. Finally, conclusions are drawn in2. Bayesian DLM and forecastingThe Bayesian DLM is a kind of process-based Bayesian prediction model which provides a flexible way to intuitively capture how processes evolve over time. It consists of two basic equations: an observation (measurement) equation and a system (evolution) equation . The observation (measurement) equation describes the relationship between the observed\nrandom vectors with mean zero and unknown covariance matrices V t and W t. The DLM defined above amounts to treating ht\nrange level at time t, and at represents the stress range change between time t 1 and t. v t is the zero-mean Gaussian random variable representing the error of measurement at moment t. x1t and x2t are both zero-mean Gaussian random variables representing the evolution of DLM from time t 1 to t. In association with the form of DLM in Equation (1), we haveThe Bayesian forecasting philosophy is based on the description of an observed process using its probability density function (PDF). As implied by the name, the Bayesian forecasting approach commences from Bayes’ theorem, hence enabling the calculation of conditional probabilities. The details of using DLM for the recursive one-step ahead forecasting of the (posterior) distribution of monitoring-derived stress ranges under the Bayesian framework are presented as follows\nNote that in Step 4, Atþ1 is the adaptive coefficient which can be viewed as the information tuner. It scales the correction term according to the relative variances of the prior and likelihood, as measured by Rtþ1=Q tþ1 and regressor value Ftþ1. etþ1 is\nthe one-step forward forecast error, the difference between the observed value ytþ1 and its expectation f tþ1. More details\nabout the recursive one-step ahead forecast method can be found in .3. Defect detection methodologyThe proposed defect detection methodology contains three logical processes: outlier detection, change-point detection,\nand damage assessment. By comparing the real-time measurement with the predicted values, the named outlier detection and change-point detection are devised to determine whether the measurement is a single outlier or the first observation of a remarkable change, the former being executed by calculating the Bayes factor, while the latter being based on the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once a change-point is affirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for further damagePotential outlier detection is the first step in the process of the proposed defect detection approach, accomplished by the Bayes factor calculation. Bayes factor is advocated because of its straightforward and natural interpretation of evidence afforded by data. At every time step t, the Bayesian DLM can yield a PDF for the next measurement, labeled as M0. Meanwhile, an artificial alternative model labeled as M1 is defined by shifting the mean of M0 by +h. The underlying idea of outlier\ndetection is to check the current observation against both M0 and M1. For each time step t, the Bayes factor is the ratio of thewhere yt is the measurement at time t and Dt1 refers to the history information up to time t 1. In the case of Gaussianwhere h is the shift value; yt is the observation value; f t and rt are the mean and standard deviation of the forecasting distribution for observation at time t. A Bayes factor H ¼ 1 indicates that the probability of the observation derived from model M1 is identical to the probability of that derived from Model M0. For better quantitative comparison between any two models, Jeffreys suggested interpreting the Bayes factor as a scale of evidence and provided descriptive statements although\nthe partitions are somewhat arbitrary. According to his suggestion, a Bayes factor can be divided into several intervals for assessing the significance of discrimination: 1 < H < 3 is ‘barely worth mentioning’, 3 < H < 10 is ‘substantial’,\n10 < H < 30 is ‘strong’, 30 < H < 100 is ‘very strong’, and H > 100 is ‘decisive’. In this study, Hmin ¼ 10 is set as a threshold\nAfter the confirmation of Hmin and h, an uncertainty limit (ucl) can be procured by the following equationFor instance, when the confidence level a and threshold of Bayes factor Hmin are set as 90% and 10 respectively, the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt. Thus, an observation is diagnosed as an outlier if its deviation from the mean value of M0 is larger\nWith the Bayes factor defined in Equation (9), only outliers with a positive deviation can be detected. To enable the outliers with negative deviation to be detected as well, a second Bayes factor is defined asIn the automatic monitoring process, both the Bayes factors H1;t and H2;t should be examined in parallel to enable thebehavior, rather than judgments based on long past performances. Change-point is an abrupt variation in time series data,\nrepresenting a transition that occurs between states. Change-point detection aims to detect abrupt change in the generative\nprocess of sequential data. It is assumed that a sequence of observations y1; ; yT could be divided into several nonoverlapping partitions, e.g. dataset j 1, dataset j, and dataset j + 1 as shown in Fig. 2. The delineations between partitions\nare known as change-points (e.g. TOC j 1 and TOC j); the goal of change-point detection is the determination of where the\nboundary of two adjacent partitions is located in a sequence of observations. Change-point detection approaches can be classified into offline and online methods. The former needs to observe the whole sequential observations before aiming to make\ninference on the generative process of the sequence [37–40], wheras the latter aims to update the inference at each time step\nwith the newly acquired measurements from the sequence [41–43]. In particular, the Bayesian online change-point detection methods are based on computing the probability distribution of the run length.differentiate between the single-point outlier and the beginning of a continual change. To overcome this problem, cumulative Bayes factor (local Bayes factors) is recommended to detect change-point(s) in the sequence of observations, by definingwhere lmax is the maximum number of Bayes factors taken into account. Unlike Bayes factor with implicitly no historical influence in the judgement, the consecutive Bayes factors collect evidence of change over a series of observation (from time\net al. . Akin to the Bayes factor threshold for outlier detection, the threshold of maximal cumulative Bayes factors is set as Lmin ¼ 10. If the conditions Lt > Lmin and lt > lmin occur simultaneously, an alarm of change is immediately issued at time t\n(time of notification, TON). The real time of occurrence (TOC) is (t lt þ 1), that is, TOC =t lt þ 1.Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is performed to assess damage extent and quantify the\nassociated uncertainty. The proposed approach directly quantifies the likelihoods of two scenarios (e.g., the sequential observations before and after the change-point), that is, ‘‘no fault” and ‘‘fault”, and the yielded results are easy to interpret. An\nadditional merit of the proposed approach is its ability to quantify the uncertainty in damage detection. Assume that the observed sequential data can be divided into two non-overlapping partitions, the first of which is regarded as healthy\nof the observations. Thus, the damage detection problem becomes the test of H0 : l ¼ l0 versus H1 : l–l0 with\nWith the above, damage detection can be achieved by means of Bayes factor which is defined as the ratio of the probability of observations given the alternate hypothesis to the probability of observations given the null hypothesiswhere D ¼ yf 1; ; yng refers to the observed data. It is proven to bewhere refers to the mean of the observed data fy1; ; yng. If no prior information is available, the initial mean and variance can be set as q ¼ l0 and s ¼ r 0 [][. The two assumptions take the prior mean and variance in the alternative hypothesis as]where z ¼ pfn **f** i ffi l0 0 [ At each time step (i.e.,][ n][=1), the Bayes factor][ B][ is larger for the larger values of][ z][j j][, which is reasonable]and easy to interpret. The logarithm of the Bayes factor, for convenience of comparison among a larger of values, is derived asIf the Bayes factor B10 is larger than 1, the implication is that the observed data provide evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis H1 (i.e., the structure is damaged). Otherwise, the observed data are judged to support the null hypothesis H0 (i.e.,\nthe structure is healthy). As with the previous threshold, B10 10 is set as a threshold for damage indication.\nIntegrating together the outlier detection, change-point detection and damage assessment, the implementation procedures of the proposed methodology are shown in Fig. 3. Beginning at time t, the single Bayes factor is firstly evaluated to\njudge whether yt is an outlier. If not, the maximum cumulative Bayes factor Lt and run length lt for change-point detection are calculated. Once a change-point is detected, the intervention is carried out by resetting the time to the time of occurrence\n(i.e., TOC = t lt þ 1) and by adjusting the mean value of M0 to the observation yt (i.e., f t ¼ yt), and the subsequent analysis\nwill then be started at TOC. Meanwhile, Bayesian hypothesis testing is executed for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification from the current TOC to the next TOC.4. Application to in-service monitoring data of high-speed trainAn onboard monitoring system has been designed and implemented on an in-service high-speed passenger train running on the Lanzhou-Urumqi High-Speed Railway (LUHSR) in China . As shown in Fig. 4, the monitoring system is composed\nof a total of 52 FBG strain sensors, 4 FBG temperature sensors, 11 accelerometers (tri-axial) and 1 noise sensor deployed on both motor and trailer bogies. Also, one tri-axial FBG accelerometer, one video camera and two GPS sensors are installed inside a train carriage. As the present work is focused on the real-time detection of potentially defective wheels by using strain monitoring data from bogies, only the deployment of strain sensors is concerned. The strain sensors are mounted\non 4 measurement zones of the bogies: (i) the zone with the action of high loads; (ii) the stress transmission zone; (iii)\nthe zone with high responses predicted by finite element analysis; and (iv) welded joints. FBG strain (and temperature) sensors are deployed and attached to the surface of the train bogie with industrial glue and tapes, and connected to the interrogator (data logger) with laptop inside the train carriage through optical fiber cables.\nThe data utilized in this study were obtained from a monitoring schedule spanning 18 days as shown in Table 1. The total length of the LUHSR between Lanzhou and Urumqi is 1777 km. In the trip from Lanzhou to Urumqi, the high-speed train\nstops by 14 stations and travels cross 13 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 13th); in trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou, the high-speed train stops by 15 stations and travels cross 14 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 14th). During the monitoring\nperiod, the train operated at its normal speed around 200–250 km/h. The sampling rate for all the sensors was set at 5000\nSince the train wheels were lathed (lathing is a process to make wheels perfectly rounded) during the monitoring period,\nthe recorded data contain information in line with two different states (before lathing and after lathing). The wheels can be considered as potentially unhealthy (defective) before lathing and as healthy after lathing. To verify the effectiveness of theproposed real-time defect detection methodology, the strain monitoring data obtained from the bogies before and afterThe train’s dynamic responses may be influenced by different subgrade conditions of the railroad, such as ground, tunnel,\nand bridge. To eliminate the effects of different railroad conditions, the strain data recorded from the same railroad sectionbefore and after lathing, are used in each scenario. In addition, the passenger loads in different trips are deemed statistically identical and the speed of train is assumed to be constant as in normal operation. Without loss of generality, the monitoring\ndata respectively obtained from two typical railroad sections (1st and 14th) in the trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou are chosen to illustrate the proposed real-time defect detection methodology, which are from the strain gauge (MS3-7) deployed at the For the sake of brevity, the monitoring data collected from the 1st railroad section are denoted as Case 1, while those from the 14th railroad section are denoted as Case 2. Firstly, the measured strain is converted to stress for the subsequent stress\nrange calculation. For the strain gauges mounted on the steel surface, the conversion of the measured strain to stress is made by rs ¼ Ee, where E is the elasticity modulus of steel and e is the strain after eliminating the effect of varying temperatures.where em is the measured strain, T m is the measured temperature in the vicinity of the strain sensor, T 0 is the temperature at\nthe installation, and a1 is a constant coefficient. In our case, the original temperature is 4, i.e., T 0 ¼ 4. The results of temperature compensation are demonstrated in Fig. 5. It is obvious that the trend in strain responses caused by temperature\nAfterwards, the stress ranges are extracted from the monitoring-derived stress data by the application of the rainflow\ncounting algorithm. From each stress cycle, the stress range Sa is obtained by calculating the difference between the maximum stress rmax and the minimum stress rmin measured in that stress cycle, i.e., Sa ¼ rmax rmin. More details on the stress ranges extraction are given in . The stress ranges with amplitudes lower than 1 MPa need to be culled because the majority are caused by noise. To decrease the uncertainty arising from the measurement facilities, the average stress ranges for\nevery ten minutes are used as the target quantities. Due to the different lengths of the two selected railroad sections (1st and 14th), the traveling time of the train in each section is also different. This results in different data lengths. The data\nlengths of the average stress ranges in Case 1 and Case 2 are 110 and 90, respectively. Figs. and 7 show the original measured strain responses before and after lathing in Case 1 and Case 2, respectively.Following the implementation procedures mentioned before, the defect detection results for Case 1 are demonstrated in\nFigs. and 9. Fig. 8(a) shows the average stress range (red point) together with 1-step ahead prediction (blue solid line) and\nthe corresponding 90% prediction interval (grey shadow). It is observed that, although some observations at the time interval t 2 fall outside the 90% prediction interval, only the Bayes factor at time t ¼ 55 exceeds the established threshold of Hmin ¼ 10 as shown in Fig. 9(a). It is thus judged as an outlier (marked as h). The reason is that because when applying the proposed approach, the shift parameter is set as h ¼ 1:645rt, resulting in the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt while the other\nfour observations are still within the uncertainty limit. On the other hand, Fig. 9(b)–(c) shows the results of the maximum cumulative Bayes factor and the corresponding run length for change detection. It is seen that the maximum cumulative\nBayes factor values at time instants t ¼ 56; 57 and 58 are larger than the threshold of Lmin ¼ 10, while merely the run length at instant t ¼ 58 surpasses the threshold of lmin ¼ 4. Apparently, this observation at time t ¼ 58 fulfills the conditions of change-point detection causing an alarm to be issued (i.e., TON ¼ 58). The identified real occurrence time of change-point is t ¼ 55 (i.e., TOC ¼ 58 4 þ 1 ¼ 55), which coincides well with the actual time point of lathing the wheels. In accordance\nwith the real-time identification of change-point occurrence, the prediction model is refined by altering the guessed mean\nvalue at TOC, as shown in Fig. 8(b). The predictions near TOC in the refined model obviously agree well with the actual observations, thus offering a better prediction performance than that of the original model.\nThe results of defect detection by means of Bayesian hypothesis testing are illustrated in Fig. 9(d). The discrimination between ‘‘healthy” and ‘‘defective” is quantified by the logarithm value of Bayes factor. It is seen from Fig. 9(d) that the vast\nmajority of logarithm values of Bayes factor before TOC are nearly zero and below the threshold level (dotted red line), which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘healthy state” (no defect). This is consistent with the actual health condition and thus validatesthe capability of the Bayesian hypothesis testing. On the contrary, all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than 2, meaning that the corresponding Bayes factor values exceed 100. According to the classification of Bayes factor stipulated in Sub-section 3.1, this result (H > 100) favors the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity is classified as ‘‘decisive”. Indeed, wheels immediately before being sent to depot for lathing were in the state of ‘heavily defective’.\nMaking use of Eq. (21), the probabilities of damage after TOC are obtained as 100%, that is, the wheels are identified as defective with a very high confidence.\nThe defect detection results for Case 2 are similar to Case 1, and are illustrated in Figs. and 11. As seen in Fig. 11(a)–(c)\nno outlier exists throughout the whole period, but a change-point is identified, of which the time of notification is t ¼ 44 (i.e.,\nTON ¼ 44) and the real time of occurrence is t ¼ 41 (i.e., TOC ¼ 44 4 þ 1 ¼ 41). The result matches well with the actual time point when wheel lathing is inflicted. For the predictions near the change-point, the modified prediction model\n(Fig. 10(b)) offers a better performance than the original model (Fig. 10(a)). As illustrated in Fig. 11(d), all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than the threshold (dotted red line), whereas the values before TOC are within thethreshold line. The values of Bayes factor after TOC are obtained to be higher than 100 (H > 100) and the corresponding probabilities of damage are approximately 100%, which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity\nApart from the accuracy of the proposed approach, the computational efficiency is also of concern. The algorithmic implementation is performed on a Lenovo ThinkCentre M720t desktop (Lenovo, Beijing, China) with Dual Intel Core i7-8700 processor (Intel, California, USA) and 24 GB of memory. The computation times consumed in Case 1 and Case 2 are 4.0109 s and\n3.7704 s respectively. In this sense, it realizes the detection of wheel defects in real time.5. ConclusionsA novel methodology for real-time defect detection of high-speed train wheels using Bayesian forecasting and dynamic linear model (DLM) has been developed and validated in this study. First, the DLM is formulated to approximate the actual\nframework. Afterwards, three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) are elicited for outlier detection and change-point detection. After the change-point has been confirmed, damage assessment is executed by the Bayesian hypothesis testing of the sequential observations before and after the change-point. Due to accommodating the dynamic evolution process and the statistical nature of the method, the proposed approach not only possesses the ability of real-time damage detection, but also enables damage quantification (through classifying the range of Bayes factor) and uncertainty assessment (through calculating the probability of damage). The methodology is illustrated by using the onlinelathing). In the two cases addressed, wheel defects are successfully identified, hence validating the effectiveness of the developed method. The quantitative results about the damage extent and confidence would provide useful information helping to\nmake cost-effective, risk-based decisions with the aim of maintaining the operation safety of high-speed rail.\nDespite the proposed methodology being developed for wheel defect detection of high-speed trains, it can also be applied to low-speed passenger and freight trains as well as extended to SHM for a wide variety of civil infrastructure (e.g., bridges,\nbuildings and tunnels) when vibration signals are available via monitoring. In this study, the second-order polynomial DLM\nis employed to model the stress ranges, which only considers the change of stress range level and trend. However, most longterm SHM data, especially long-term strain monitoring data, are generally contaminated by trend, seasonal (cyclical) and\nregression effects, which require a more complex model. The Bayesian DLM enables the modeling of time-dependent responses of a structure by integrating appropriate components, for instance, the response with cyclical characteristics\ncan be depicted by embedding a seasonal (cyclical) component. Thus, in accordance with the nature of monitoring data,\nan appropriate Bayesian DLM enabling to describe time series data of different features, can be formulated for damage detection of a variety of structures subject to different operational/environmental conditions.Administrative Region, China (Project No. PolyU 152024/17E).

IntroductionHigh-speed rail (HSR) is being developed in Asian and European countries to satisfy the rapidly growing demand for intercity services and to shore up economic growth. The rapid\ngrowth of HSR, however, has posed great challenges regarding operation safety, reliability\nand ride comfort. Irregular wheel defects can induce high-magnitude impact forces hindering safety and ride comfort of HSR and may also cause damage to rail tracks and vehicles.real time. The proposed methodology embraces logics for (i) prognosis, (ii) potential outlier\ndetection, (iii) identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and (iv) quantification of damage extent and uncertainty. Relying on the strain monitoring data acquired from high-speed train bogies, the Bayesian DLM for characterizing the actual stress ranges is established, by which one-step forecast distribution is elicited before proceeding to the\nnext observation. The detection of change-point is executed by comparing the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM) and an alternative model\n(the mean value is shifted by a prescribed offset) to determine which better fits the actual observation. If the comparison results are in favor of the alternative model, it is claimed that a potential change has occurred. Whether such an observation is an outlier or the beginning of a genuine change (change-point), three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum\ncumulative Bayes factor and run length) are performed for further identification.

Rail accidents were occasionally caused by failures such as severe defects or fatigue of railway components. To maintain a good service quality and operation safety, it is paramount to develop\nonline monitoring techniques that not only quickly recognize faults of mission-critical HSR components but also can anticipate of long-term mechanisms and gradual deterioration in performance.\nWheelsets in a high-speed train are physically connected with and controlled by the bogie system which corrects alignment for stable running and reduces the vibration caused by wheel-rail interaction . However, the wheel performance\nprogressively deteriorates in different mechanisms (e.g., wheel flat and wheel polygonization) during the routine operation of a high-speed train . Wheel performance deterioration increases stresses experienced by the bogie system. In addition,\nthe increased stress within bogie frames caused by wheel quality deterioration can be unexpectedly large, thus posing a serious threat to the operation safety of concerned trains. According to the statistics of train accidents caused by failure in\nmechanical components during 2004 to 2007 in the United States, the wheelsets faults are the most cause with a rate of\n44.7% . Therefore, the railway managers are keen to keep wheels in an adequate condition and detect potential failure\nas soon as possible. For railway wheels, there are three different ways of estimating the conditions: physical modeling, statistical modeling and condition monitoring . However, the first two ways are not applicable to in-service\nwheel condition assessment, and in contrast, the third way is most feasible for wheel condition estimation. The monitoring approaches available to wheel defect detection can be divided into in-workshop inspection and in-service detection . The\nlatter provides the real-time data required for maintenance planning, while the former is normally carried out at workshops at fixed intervals. The commonly used in-workshop methods for wheel defect inspection include the ultrasonic techniques, infrared camera and magnetic methods . In-service monitoring approaches can be categorized as on-board and wayside methods. The on-board methods implement sensors on the train and continuously obtain comprehensive data from\nthe system. The methods of this category include magnetic technique , ultrasonic technique , acoustic technique, and vibration technique . On the other hand, wayside methods attempt to detect the wheel or vehicle performance\nby installing sensors on the rail or its surrounding areas. Such indirect measurements give rise to limited information of the wheel condition while they can monitor all train wheels going by with using only one or a few sensors. According to the type\nof sensors used, wayside detection approaches include strain sensing technology , fiber optic sensing technology ,\nultrasonic technique , vibration technique , acoustic emission , lasers and high-speed cameras . However,\nthe study on data interpretation techniques enabling the extraction of defect-sensitive features is far from sufficient.\nBayesian dynamic linear model (DLM) is an elegant system approach to handling time series data from a Bayesian perspective, which originates from the field of applied statistics and is extensively used in other fields such as economics\nand engineering [25–30]. The Bayesian DLM treats the time series as the output of a dynamic system perturbed by random disturbances. It is suitable for modeling both univariate and multivariate time series, and also for representing the structural changes, non-stationarity and irregular patterns . Unlike the classical time series method which assumes a fixed relationship between the dependent variables (response variables) and the independent variables (regressors), the DLM considers\nthe relationship changes over time and is able to directly capture time series data features, such as trend, seasonality,\nand regression effects. Moreover, the DLM allows for descriptions of temporary or permanent shifts in time series parameters that occur abruptly, which are necessary for outlier and damage detection in structural health monitoring (SHM) paradigms. Recently, Goulet and his collaborator adopted the Bayesian DLM theory in SHM to model the time-dependent\nresponses of structures by breaking them into subcomponents. In the perspective of real-time damage detection, only few studies are available. The first attempt was conducted by Lipowsky et al. with the development of a Bayesian DLM-based\nreal-time detection algorithm to evaluate the performance of a gas turbine using simulated data. Later on, Wang et al.\nand Zhang et al. adopted the above algorithm for detecting high-speed train defects by using real-world monitoring\ndata. In the previous studies, however, the real-time detection algorithm devised possesses only outlier identification and\nchange detection abilities, without the function of damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.context of Bayesian DLM, which incorporates logics for prognosis, potential outlier detection, identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and damage extent and uncertainty quantification. The Bayesian DLM is considered as a tool\nfor time series analysis, while Bayesian forecasting is executed to enable the calculation of one-step ahead forecast distribution. The change-point detection is performed by checking the current observation against the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM for current instant) as well as against an alternative model of which the mean value\nis shifted by a prescribed offset. The detection rule is that if the alternative model better fits the actual observation, a potential change is signaled. To further determine whether such an observation is only an outlier or the beginning of an actual\nchange (change-point), a specific logic is developed by introducing the Bayes factor and the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.\nThe main contributions of this study are the provision of: (i) a formula which not only enables the modeling of actual framework; (ii) three metrics (i.e., the Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) to allow for outlier\nand change-point detection in real-time manner; and (iii) an efficient way for damage extent assessment and uncertainty\nquantification. The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the Bayesian DLM theory and an elaboration of the Bayesian forecasting philosophy. Section 3 presents the defect detection methodology that incorporates logics for\noutlier detection, change-point identification, and damage assessment. In Section 4, two case studies making use of timeseries strain data acquired by fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors affixed on the bogies of an in-service high-speed train are offered to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the proposed methodology. Finally, conclusions are drawn in2. Bayesian DLM and forecastingThe Bayesian DLM is a kind of process-based Bayesian prediction model which provides a flexible way to intuitively capture how processes evolve over time. It consists of two basic equations: an observation (measurement) equation and a system (evolution) equation . The observation (measurement) equation describes the relationship between the observed\nrandom vectors with mean zero and unknown covariance matrices V t and W t. The DLM defined above amounts to treating ht\nrange level at time t, and at represents the stress range change between time t 1 and t. v t is the zero-mean Gaussian random variable representing the error of measurement at moment t. x1t and x2t are both zero-mean Gaussian random variables representing the evolution of DLM from time t 1 to t. In association with the form of DLM in Equation (1), we haveThe Bayesian forecasting philosophy is based on the description of an observed process using its probability density function (PDF). As implied by the name, the Bayesian forecasting approach commences from Bayes’ theorem, hence enabling the calculation of conditional probabilities. The details of using DLM for the recursive one-step ahead forecasting of the (posterior) distribution of monitoring-derived stress ranges under the Bayesian framework are presented as follows\nNote that in Step 4, Atþ1 is the adaptive coefficient which can be viewed as the information tuner. It scales the correction term according to the relative variances of the prior and likelihood, as measured by Rtþ1=Q tþ1 and regressor value Ftþ1. etþ1 is\nthe one-step forward forecast error, the difference between the observed value ytþ1 and its expectation f tþ1. More details\nabout the recursive one-step ahead forecast method can be found in .3. Defect detection methodologyThe proposed defect detection methodology contains three logical processes: outlier detection, change-point detection,\nand damage assessment. By comparing the real-time measurement with the predicted values, the named outlier detection and change-point detection are devised to determine whether the measurement is a single outlier or the first observation of a remarkable change, the former being executed by calculating the Bayes factor, while the latter being based on the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once a change-point is affirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for further damagePotential outlier detection is the first step in the process of the proposed defect detection approach, accomplished by the Bayes factor calculation. Bayes factor is advocated because of its straightforward and natural interpretation of evidence afforded by data. At every time step t, the Bayesian DLM can yield a PDF for the next measurement, labeled as M0. Meanwhile, an artificial alternative model labeled as M1 is defined by shifting the mean of M0 by +h. The underlying idea of outlier\ndetection is to check the current observation against both M0 and M1. For each time step t, the Bayes factor is the ratio of thewhere yt is the measurement at time t and Dt1 refers to the history information up to time t 1. In the case of Gaussianwhere h is the shift value; yt is the observation value; f t and rt are the mean and standard deviation of the forecasting distribution for observation at time t. A Bayes factor H ¼ 1 indicates that the probability of the observation derived from model M1 is identical to the probability of that derived from Model M0. For better quantitative comparison between any two models, Jeffreys suggested interpreting the Bayes factor as a scale of evidence and provided descriptive statements although\nthe partitions are somewhat arbitrary. According to his suggestion, a Bayes factor can be divided into several intervals for assessing the significance of discrimination: 1 < H < 3 is ‘barely worth mentioning’, 3 < H < 10 is ‘substantial’,\n10 < H < 30 is ‘strong’, 30 < H < 100 is ‘very strong’, and H > 100 is ‘decisive’. In this study, Hmin ¼ 10 is set as a threshold\nAfter the confirmation of Hmin and h, an uncertainty limit (ucl) can be procured by the following equationFor instance, when the confidence level a and threshold of Bayes factor Hmin are set as 90% and 10 respectively, the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt. Thus, an observation is diagnosed as an outlier if its deviation from the mean value of M0 is larger\nWith the Bayes factor defined in Equation (9), only outliers with a positive deviation can be detected. To enable the outliers with negative deviation to be detected as well, a second Bayes factor is defined asIn the automatic monitoring process, both the Bayes factors H1;t and H2;t should be examined in parallel to enable thebehavior, rather than judgments based on long past performances. Change-point is an abrupt variation in time series data,\nrepresenting a transition that occurs between states. Change-point detection aims to detect abrupt change in the generative\nprocess of sequential data. It is assumed that a sequence of observations y1; ; yT could be divided into several nonoverlapping partitions, e.g. dataset j 1, dataset j, and dataset j + 1 as shown in Fig. 2. The delineations between partitions\nare known as change-points (e.g. TOC j 1 and TOC j); the goal of change-point detection is the determination of where the\nboundary of two adjacent partitions is located in a sequence of observations. Change-point detection approaches can be classified into offline and online methods. The former needs to observe the whole sequential observations before aiming to make\ninference on the generative process of the sequence [37–40], wheras the latter aims to update the inference at each time step\nwith the newly acquired measurements from the sequence [41–43]. In particular, the Bayesian online change-point detection methods are based on computing the probability distribution of the run length.differentiate between the single-point outlier and the beginning of a continual change. To overcome this problem, cumulative Bayes factor (local Bayes factors) is recommended to detect change-point(s) in the sequence of observations, by definingwhere lmax is the maximum number of Bayes factors taken into account. Unlike Bayes factor with implicitly no historical influence in the judgement, the consecutive Bayes factors collect evidence of change over a series of observation (from time\net al. . Akin to the Bayes factor threshold for outlier detection, the threshold of maximal cumulative Bayes factors is set as Lmin ¼ 10. If the conditions Lt > Lmin and lt > lmin occur simultaneously, an alarm of change is immediately issued at time t\n(time of notification, TON). The real time of occurrence (TOC) is (t lt þ 1), that is, TOC =t lt þ 1.Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is performed to assess damage extent and quantify the\nassociated uncertainty. The proposed approach directly quantifies the likelihoods of two scenarios (e.g., the sequential observations before and after the change-point), that is, ‘‘no fault” and ‘‘fault”, and the yielded results are easy to interpret. An\nadditional merit of the proposed approach is its ability to quantify the uncertainty in damage detection. Assume that the observed sequential data can be divided into two non-overlapping partitions, the first of which is regarded as healthy\nof the observations. Thus, the damage detection problem becomes the test of H0 : l ¼ l0 versus H1 : l–l0 with\nWith the above, damage detection can be achieved by means of Bayes factor which is defined as the ratio of the probability of observations given the alternate hypothesis to the probability of observations given the null hypothesiswhere D ¼ yf 1; ; yng refers to the observed data. It is proven to bewhere refers to the mean of the observed data fy1; ; yng. If no prior information is available, the initial mean and variance can be set as q ¼ l0 and s ¼ r 0 [][. The two assumptions take the prior mean and variance in the alternative hypothesis as]where z ¼ pfn **f** i ffi l0 0 [ At each time step (i.e.,][ n][=1), the Bayes factor][ B][ is larger for the larger values of][ z][j j][, which is reasonable]and easy to interpret. The logarithm of the Bayes factor, for convenience of comparison among a larger of values, is derived asIf the Bayes factor B10 is larger than 1, the implication is that the observed data provide evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis H1 (i.e., the structure is damaged). Otherwise, the observed data are judged to support the null hypothesis H0 (i.e.,\nthe structure is healthy). As with the previous threshold, B10 10 is set as a threshold for damage indication.\nIntegrating together the outlier detection, change-point detection and damage assessment, the implementation procedures of the proposed methodology are shown in Fig. 3. Beginning at time t, the single Bayes factor is firstly evaluated to\njudge whether yt is an outlier. If not, the maximum cumulative Bayes factor Lt and run length lt for change-point detection are calculated. Once a change-point is detected, the intervention is carried out by resetting the time to the time of occurrence\n(i.e., TOC = t lt þ 1) and by adjusting the mean value of M0 to the observation yt (i.e., f t ¼ yt), and the subsequent analysis\nwill then be started at TOC. Meanwhile, Bayesian hypothesis testing is executed for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification from the current TOC to the next TOC.4. Application to in-service monitoring data of high-speed trainAn onboard monitoring system has been designed and implemented on an in-service high-speed passenger train running on the Lanzhou-Urumqi High-Speed Railway (LUHSR) in China . As shown in Fig. 4, the monitoring system is composed\nof a total of 52 FBG strain sensors, 4 FBG temperature sensors, 11 accelerometers (tri-axial) and 1 noise sensor deployed on both motor and trailer bogies. Also, one tri-axial FBG accelerometer, one video camera and two GPS sensors are installed inside a train carriage. As the present work is focused on the real-time detection of potentially defective wheels by using strain monitoring data from bogies, only the deployment of strain sensors is concerned. The strain sensors are mounted\non 4 measurement zones of the bogies: (i) the zone with the action of high loads; (ii) the stress transmission zone; (iii)\nthe zone with high responses predicted by finite element analysis; and (iv) welded joints. FBG strain (and temperature) sensors are deployed and attached to the surface of the train bogie with industrial glue and tapes, and connected to the interrogator (data logger) with laptop inside the train carriage through optical fiber cables.\nThe data utilized in this study were obtained from a monitoring schedule spanning 18 days as shown in Table 1. The total length of the LUHSR between Lanzhou and Urumqi is 1777 km. In the trip from Lanzhou to Urumqi, the high-speed train\nstops by 14 stations and travels cross 13 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 13th); in trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou, the high-speed train stops by 15 stations and travels cross 14 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 14th). During the monitoring\nperiod, the train operated at its normal speed around 200–250 km/h. The sampling rate for all the sensors was set at 5000\nSince the train wheels were lathed (lathing is a process to make wheels perfectly rounded) during the monitoring period,\nthe recorded data contain information in line with two different states (before lathing and after lathing). The wheels can be considered as potentially unhealthy (defective) before lathing and as healthy after lathing. To verify the effectiveness of theproposed real-time defect detection methodology, the strain monitoring data obtained from the bogies before and afterThe train’s dynamic responses may be influenced by different subgrade conditions of the railroad, such as ground, tunnel,\nand bridge. To eliminate the effects of different railroad conditions, the strain data recorded from the same railroad sectionbefore and after lathing, are used in each scenario. In addition, the passenger loads in different trips are deemed statistically identical and the speed of train is assumed to be constant as in normal operation. Without loss of generality, the monitoring\ndata respectively obtained from two typical railroad sections (1st and 14th) in the trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou are chosen to illustrate the proposed real-time defect detection methodology, which are from the strain gauge (MS3-7) deployed at the For the sake of brevity, the monitoring data collected from the 1st railroad section are denoted as Case 1, while those from the 14th railroad section are denoted as Case 2. Firstly, the measured strain is converted to stress for the subsequent stress\nrange calculation. For the strain gauges mounted on the steel surface, the conversion of the measured strain to stress is made by rs ¼ Ee, where E is the elasticity modulus of steel and e is the strain after eliminating the effect of varying temperatures.where em is the measured strain, T m is the measured temperature in the vicinity of the strain sensor, T 0 is the temperature at\nthe installation, and a1 is a constant coefficient. In our case, the original temperature is 4, i.e., T 0 ¼ 4. The results of temperature compensation are demonstrated in Fig. 5. It is obvious that the trend in strain responses caused by temperature\nAfterwards, the stress ranges are extracted from the monitoring-derived stress data by the application of the rainflow\ncounting algorithm. From each stress cycle, the stress range Sa is obtained by calculating the difference between the maximum stress rmax and the minimum stress rmin measured in that stress cycle, i.e., Sa ¼ rmax rmin. More details on the stress ranges extraction are given in . The stress ranges with amplitudes lower than 1 MPa need to be culled because the majority are caused by noise. To decrease the uncertainty arising from the measurement facilities, the average stress ranges for\nevery ten minutes are used as the target quantities. Due to the different lengths of the two selected railroad sections (1st and 14th), the traveling time of the train in each section is also different. This results in different data lengths. The data\nlengths of the average stress ranges in Case 1 and Case 2 are 110 and 90, respectively. Figs. and 7 show the original measured strain responses before and after lathing in Case 1 and Case 2, respectively.Following the implementation procedures mentioned before, the defect detection results for Case 1 are demonstrated in\nFigs. and 9. Fig. 8(a) shows the average stress range (red point) together with 1-step ahead prediction (blue solid line) and\nthe corresponding 90% prediction interval (grey shadow). It is observed that, although some observations at the time interval t 2 fall outside the 90% prediction interval, only the Bayes factor at time t ¼ 55 exceeds the established threshold of Hmin ¼ 10 as shown in Fig. 9(a). It is thus judged as an outlier (marked as h). The reason is that because when applying the proposed approach, the shift parameter is set as h ¼ 1:645rt, resulting in the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt while the other\nfour observations are still within the uncertainty limit. On the other hand, Fig. 9(b)–(c) shows the results of the maximum cumulative Bayes factor and the corresponding run length for change detection. It is seen that the maximum cumulative\nBayes factor values at time instants t ¼ 56; 57 and 58 are larger than the threshold of Lmin ¼ 10, while merely the run length at instant t ¼ 58 surpasses the threshold of lmin ¼ 4. Apparently, this observation at time t ¼ 58 fulfills the conditions of change-point detection causing an alarm to be issued (i.e., TON ¼ 58). The identified real occurrence time of change-point is t ¼ 55 (i.e., TOC ¼ 58 4 þ 1 ¼ 55), which coincides well with the actual time point of lathing the wheels. In accordance\nwith the real-time identification of change-point occurrence, the prediction model is refined by altering the guessed mean\nvalue at TOC, as shown in Fig. 8(b). The predictions near TOC in the refined model obviously agree well with the actual observations, thus offering a better prediction performance than that of the original model.\nThe results of defect detection by means of Bayesian hypothesis testing are illustrated in Fig. 9(d). The discrimination between ‘‘healthy” and ‘‘defective” is quantified by the logarithm value of Bayes factor. It is seen from Fig. 9(d) that the vast\nmajority of logarithm values of Bayes factor before TOC are nearly zero and below the threshold level (dotted red line), which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘healthy state” (no defect). This is consistent with the actual health condition and thus validatesthe capability of the Bayesian hypothesis testing. On the contrary, all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than 2, meaning that the corresponding Bayes factor values exceed 100. According to the classification of Bayes factor stipulated in Sub-section 3.1, this result (H > 100) favors the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity is classified as ‘‘decisive”. Indeed, wheels immediately before being sent to depot for lathing were in the state of ‘heavily defective’.\nMaking use of Eq. (21), the probabilities of damage after TOC are obtained as 100%, that is, the wheels are identified as defective with a very high confidence.\nThe defect detection results for Case 2 are similar to Case 1, and are illustrated in Figs. and 11. As seen in Fig. 11(a)–(c)\nno outlier exists throughout the whole period, but a change-point is identified, of which the time of notification is t ¼ 44 (i.e.,\nTON ¼ 44) and the real time of occurrence is t ¼ 41 (i.e., TOC ¼ 44 4 þ 1 ¼ 41). The result matches well with the actual time point when wheel lathing is inflicted. For the predictions near the change-point, the modified prediction model\n(Fig. 10(b)) offers a better performance than the original model (Fig. 10(a)). As illustrated in Fig. 11(d), all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than the threshold (dotted red line), whereas the values before TOC are within thethreshold line. The values of Bayes factor after TOC are obtained to be higher than 100 (H > 100) and the corresponding probabilities of damage are approximately 100%, which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity\nApart from the accuracy of the proposed approach, the computational efficiency is also of concern. The algorithmic implementation is performed on a Lenovo ThinkCentre M720t desktop (Lenovo, Beijing, China) with Dual Intel Core i7-8700 processor (Intel, California, USA) and 24 GB of memory. The computation times consumed in Case 1 and Case 2 are 4.0109 s and\n3.7704 s respectively. In this sense, it realizes the detection of wheel defects in real time.5. ConclusionsA novel methodology for real-time defect detection of high-speed train wheels using Bayesian forecasting and dynamic linear model (DLM) has been developed and validated in this study. First, the DLM is formulated to approximate the actual\nframework. Afterwards, three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) are elicited for outlier detection and change-point detection. After the change-point has been confirmed, damage assessment is executed by the Bayesian hypothesis testing of the sequential observations before and after the change-point. Due to accommodating the dynamic evolution process and the statistical nature of the method, the proposed approach not only possesses the ability of real-time damage detection, but also enables damage quantification (through classifying the range of Bayes factor) and uncertainty assessment (through calculating the probability of damage). The methodology is illustrated by using the onlinelathing). In the two cases addressed, wheel defects are successfully identified, hence validating the effectiveness of the developed method. The quantitative results about the damage extent and confidence would provide useful information helping to\nmake cost-effective, risk-based decisions with the aim of maintaining the operation safety of high-speed rail.\nDespite the proposed methodology being developed for wheel defect detection of high-speed trains, it can also be applied to low-speed passenger and freight trains as well as extended to SHM for a wide variety of civil infrastructure (e.g., bridges,\nbuildings and tunnels) when vibration signals are available via monitoring. In this study, the second-order polynomial DLM\nis employed to model the stress ranges, which only considers the change of stress range level and trend. However, most longterm SHM data, especially long-term strain monitoring data, are generally contaminated by trend, seasonal (cyclical) and\nregression effects, which require a more complex model. The Bayesian DLM enables the modeling of time-dependent responses of a structure by integrating appropriate components, for instance, the response with cyclical characteristics\ncan be depicted by embedding a seasonal (cyclical) component. Thus, in accordance with the nature of monitoring data,\nan appropriate Bayesian DLM enabling to describe time series data of different features, can be formulated for damage detection of a variety of structures subject to different operational/environmental conditions.Administrative Region, China (Project No. PolyU 152024/17E).

The rapid\ngrowth of HSR, however, has posed great challenges regarding operation safety, reliability\nand ride comfort. Irregular wheel defects can induce high-magnitude impact forces hindering safety and ride comfort of HSR and may also cause damage to rail tracks and vehicles.real time.

Rail accidents were occasionally caused by failures such as severe defects or fatigue of railway components. To maintain a good service quality and operation safety, it is paramount to develop\nonline monitoring techniques that not only quickly recognize faults of mission-critical HSR components but also can anticipate of long-term mechanisms and gradual deterioration in performance.\nWheelsets in a high-speed train are physically connected with and controlled by the bogie system which corrects alignment for stable running and reduces the vibration caused by wheel-rail interaction . However, the wheel performance\nprogressively deteriorates in different mechanisms (e.g., wheel flat and wheel polygonization) during the routine operation of a high-speed train . Wheel performance deterioration increases stresses experienced by the bogie system. In addition,\nthe increased stress within bogie frames caused by wheel quality deterioration can be unexpectedly large, thus posing a serious threat to the operation safety of concerned trains. According to the statistics of train accidents caused by failure in\nmechanical components during 2004 to 2007 in the United States, the wheelsets faults are the most cause with a rate of\n44.7% . Therefore, the railway managers are keen to keep wheels in an adequate condition and detect potential failure\nas soon as possible. For railway wheels, there are three different ways of estimating the conditions: physical modeling, statistical modeling and condition monitoring . However, the first two ways are not applicable to in-service\nwheel condition assessment, and in contrast, the third way is most feasible for wheel condition estimation. The monitoring approaches available to wheel defect detection can be divided into in-workshop inspection and in-service detection . The\nlatter provides the real-time data required for maintenance planning, while the former is normally carried out at workshops at fixed intervals. The commonly used in-workshop methods for wheel defect inspection include the ultrasonic techniques, infrared camera and magnetic methods . In-service monitoring approaches can be categorized as on-board and wayside methods. The on-board methods implement sensors on the train and continuously obtain comprehensive data from\nthe system. The methods of this category include magnetic technique , ultrasonic technique , acoustic technique, and vibration technique . On the other hand, wayside methods attempt to detect the wheel or vehicle performance\nby installing sensors on the rail or its surrounding areas. Such indirect measurements give rise to limited information of the wheel condition while they can monitor all train wheels going by with using only one or a few sensors. According to the type\nof sensors used, wayside detection approaches include strain sensing technology , fiber optic sensing technology ,\nultrasonic technique , vibration technique , acoustic emission , lasers and high-speed cameras . However,\nthe study on data interpretation techniques enabling the extraction of defect-sensitive features is far from sufficient.\nBayesian dynamic linear model (DLM) is an elegant system approach to handling time series data from a Bayesian perspective, which originates from the field of applied statistics and is extensively used in other fields such as economics\nand engineering [25–30]. The Bayesian DLM treats the time series as the output of a dynamic system perturbed by random disturbances. It is suitable for modeling both univariate and multivariate time series, and also for representing the structural changes, non-stationarity and irregular patterns . Unlike the classical time series method which assumes a fixed relationship between the dependent variables (response variables) and the independent variables (regressors), the DLM considers\nthe relationship changes over time and is able to directly capture time series data features, such as trend, seasonality,\nand regression effects. Moreover, the DLM allows for descriptions of temporary or permanent shifts in time series parameters that occur abruptly, which are necessary for outlier and damage detection in structural health monitoring (SHM) paradigms. Recently, Goulet and his collaborator adopted the Bayesian DLM theory in SHM to model the time-dependent\nresponses of structures by breaking them into subcomponents. In the perspective of real-time damage detection, only few studies are available. The first attempt was conducted by Lipowsky et al. with the development of a Bayesian DLM-based\nreal-time detection algorithm to evaluate the performance of a gas turbine using simulated data. Later on, Wang et al.\nand Zhang et al. adopted the above algorithm for detecting high-speed train defects by using real-world monitoring\ndata. In the previous studies, however, the real-time detection algorithm devised possesses only outlier identification and\nchange detection abilities, without the function of damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.context of Bayesian DLM, which incorporates logics for prognosis, potential outlier detection, identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and damage extent and uncertainty quantification. The Bayesian DLM is considered as a tool\nfor time series analysis, while Bayesian forecasting is executed to enable the calculation of one-step ahead forecast distribution. The change-point detection is performed by checking the current observation against the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM for current instant) as well as against an alternative model of which the mean value\nis shifted by a prescribed offset. The detection rule is that if the alternative model better fits the actual observation, a potential change is signaled. To further determine whether such an observation is only an outlier or the beginning of an actual\nchange (change-point), a specific logic is developed by introducing the Bayes factor and the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.\nThe main contributions of this study are the provision of: (i) a formula which not only enables the modeling of actual framework; (ii) three metrics (i.e., the Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) to allow for outlier\nand change-point detection in real-time manner; and (iii) an efficient way for damage extent assessment and uncertainty\nquantification. The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the Bayesian DLM theory and an elaboration of the Bayesian forecasting philosophy. Section 3 presents the defect detection methodology that incorporates logics for\noutlier detection, change-point identification, and damage assessment. In Section 4, two case studies making use of timeseries strain data acquired by fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors affixed on the bogies of an in-service high-speed train are offered to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the proposed methodology. Finally, conclusions are drawn in2. Bayesian DLM and forecastingThe Bayesian DLM is a kind of process-based Bayesian prediction model which provides a flexible way to intuitively capture how processes evolve over time. It consists of two basic equations: an observation (measurement) equation and a system (evolution) equation . The observation (measurement) equation describes the relationship between the observed\nrandom vectors with mean zero and unknown covariance matrices V t and W t. The DLM defined above amounts to treating ht\nrange level at time t, and at represents the stress range change between time t 1 and t. v t is the zero-mean Gaussian random variable representing the error of measurement at moment t. x1t and x2t are both zero-mean Gaussian random variables representing the evolution of DLM from time t 1 to t. In association with the form of DLM in Equation (1), we haveThe Bayesian forecasting philosophy is based on the description of an observed process using its probability density function (PDF). As implied by the name, the Bayesian forecasting approach commences from Bayes’ theorem, hence enabling the calculation of conditional probabilities. The details of using DLM for the recursive one-step ahead forecasting of the (posterior) distribution of monitoring-derived stress ranges under the Bayesian framework are presented as follows\nNote that in Step 4, Atþ1 is the adaptive coefficient which can be viewed as the information tuner. It scales the correction term according to the relative variances of the prior and likelihood, as measured by Rtþ1=Q tþ1 and regressor value Ftþ1. etþ1 is\nthe one-step forward forecast error, the difference between the observed value ytþ1 and its expectation f tþ1. More details\nabout the recursive one-step ahead forecast method can be found in .3. Defect detection methodologyThe proposed defect detection methodology contains three logical processes: outlier detection, change-point detection,\nand damage assessment. By comparing the real-time measurement with the predicted values, the named outlier detection and change-point detection are devised to determine whether the measurement is a single outlier or the first observation of a remarkable change, the former being executed by calculating the Bayes factor, while the latter being based on the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once a change-point is affirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for further damagePotential outlier detection is the first step in the process of the proposed defect detection approach, accomplished by the Bayes factor calculation. Bayes factor is advocated because of its straightforward and natural interpretation of evidence afforded by data. At every time step t, the Bayesian DLM can yield a PDF for the next measurement, labeled as M0. Meanwhile, an artificial alternative model labeled as M1 is defined by shifting the mean of M0 by +h. The underlying idea of outlier\ndetection is to check the current observation against both M0 and M1. For each time step t, the Bayes factor is the ratio of thewhere yt is the measurement at time t and Dt1 refers to the history information up to time t 1. In the case of Gaussianwhere h is the shift value; yt is the observation value; f t and rt are the mean and standard deviation of the forecasting distribution for observation at time t. A Bayes factor H ¼ 1 indicates that the probability of the observation derived from model M1 is identical to the probability of that derived from Model M0. For better quantitative comparison between any two models, Jeffreys suggested interpreting the Bayes factor as a scale of evidence and provided descriptive statements although\nthe partitions are somewhat arbitrary. According to his suggestion, a Bayes factor can be divided into several intervals for assessing the significance of discrimination: 1 < H < 3 is ‘barely worth mentioning’, 3 < H < 10 is ‘substantial’,\n10 < H < 30 is ‘strong’, 30 < H < 100 is ‘very strong’, and H > 100 is ‘decisive’. In this study, Hmin ¼ 10 is set as a threshold\nAfter the confirmation of Hmin and h, an uncertainty limit (ucl) can be procured by the following equationFor instance, when the confidence level a and threshold of Bayes factor Hmin are set as 90% and 10 respectively, the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt. Thus, an observation is diagnosed as an outlier if its deviation from the mean value of M0 is larger\nWith the Bayes factor defined in Equation (9), only outliers with a positive deviation can be detected. To enable the outliers with negative deviation to be detected as well, a second Bayes factor is defined asIn the automatic monitoring process, both the Bayes factors H1;t and H2;t should be examined in parallel to enable thebehavior, rather than judgments based on long past performances. Change-point is an abrupt variation in time series data,\nrepresenting a transition that occurs between states. Change-point detection aims to detect abrupt change in the generative\nprocess of sequential data. It is assumed that a sequence of observations y1; ; yT could be divided into several nonoverlapping partitions, e.g. dataset j 1, dataset j, and dataset j + 1 as shown in Fig. 2. The delineations between partitions\nare known as change-points (e.g. TOC j 1 and TOC j); the goal of change-point detection is the determination of where the\nboundary of two adjacent partitions is located in a sequence of observations. Change-point detection approaches can be classified into offline and online methods. The former needs to observe the whole sequential observations before aiming to make\ninference on the generative process of the sequence [37–40], wheras the latter aims to update the inference at each time step\nwith the newly acquired measurements from the sequence [41–43]. In particular, the Bayesian online change-point detection methods are based on computing the probability distribution of the run length.differentiate between the single-point outlier and the beginning of a continual change. To overcome this problem, cumulative Bayes factor (local Bayes factors) is recommended to detect change-point(s) in the sequence of observations, by definingwhere lmax is the maximum number of Bayes factors taken into account. Unlike Bayes factor with implicitly no historical influence in the judgement, the consecutive Bayes factors collect evidence of change over a series of observation (from time\net al. . Akin to the Bayes factor threshold for outlier detection, the threshold of maximal cumulative Bayes factors is set as Lmin ¼ 10. If the conditions Lt > Lmin and lt > lmin occur simultaneously, an alarm of change is immediately issued at time t\n(time of notification, TON). The real time of occurrence (TOC) is (t lt þ 1), that is, TOC =t lt þ 1.Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is performed to assess damage extent and quantify the\nassociated uncertainty. The proposed approach directly quantifies the likelihoods of two scenarios (e.g., the sequential observations before and after the change-point), that is, ‘‘no fault” and ‘‘fault”, and the yielded results are easy to interpret. An\nadditional merit of the proposed approach is its ability to quantify the uncertainty in damage detection. Assume that the observed sequential data can be divided into two non-overlapping partitions, the first of which is regarded as healthy\nof the observations. Thus, the damage detection problem becomes the test of H0 : l ¼ l0 versus H1 : l–l0 with\nWith the above, damage detection can be achieved by means of Bayes factor which is defined as the ratio of the probability of observations given the alternate hypothesis to the probability of observations given the null hypothesiswhere D ¼ yf 1; ; yng refers to the observed data. It is proven to bewhere refers to the mean of the observed data fy1; ; yng. If no prior information is available, the initial mean and variance can be set as q ¼ l0 and s ¼ r 0 [][. The two assumptions take the prior mean and variance in the alternative hypothesis as]where z ¼ pfn **f** i ffi l0 0 [ At each time step (i.e.,][ n][=1), the Bayes factor][ B][ is larger for the larger values of][ z][j j][, which is reasonable]and easy to interpret. The logarithm of the Bayes factor, for convenience of comparison among a larger of values, is derived asIf the Bayes factor B10 is larger than 1, the implication is that the observed data provide evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis H1 (i.e., the structure is damaged). Otherwise, the observed data are judged to support the null hypothesis H0 (i.e.,\nthe structure is healthy). As with the previous threshold, B10 10 is set as a threshold for damage indication.\nIntegrating together the outlier detection, change-point detection and damage assessment, the implementation procedures of the proposed methodology are shown in Fig. 3. Beginning at time t, the single Bayes factor is firstly evaluated to\njudge whether yt is an outlier. If not, the maximum cumulative Bayes factor Lt and run length lt for change-point detection are calculated. Once a change-point is detected, the intervention is carried out by resetting the time to the time of occurrence\n(i.e., TOC = t lt þ 1) and by adjusting the mean value of M0 to the observation yt (i.e., f t ¼ yt), and the subsequent analysis\nwill then be started at TOC. Meanwhile, Bayesian hypothesis testing is executed for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification from the current TOC to the next TOC.4. Application to in-service monitoring data of high-speed trainAn onboard monitoring system has been designed and implemented on an in-service high-speed passenger train running on the Lanzhou-Urumqi High-Speed Railway (LUHSR) in China . As shown in Fig. 4, the monitoring system is composed\nof a total of 52 FBG strain sensors, 4 FBG temperature sensors, 11 accelerometers (tri-axial) and 1 noise sensor deployed on both motor and trailer bogies. Also, one tri-axial FBG accelerometer, one video camera and two GPS sensors are installed inside a train carriage. As the present work is focused on the real-time detection of potentially defective wheels by using strain monitoring data from bogies, only the deployment of strain sensors is concerned. The strain sensors are mounted\non 4 measurement zones of the bogies: (i) the zone with the action of high loads; (ii) the stress transmission zone; (iii)\nthe zone with high responses predicted by finite element analysis; and (iv) welded joints. FBG strain (and temperature) sensors are deployed and attached to the surface of the train bogie with industrial glue and tapes, and connected to the interrogator (data logger) with laptop inside the train carriage through optical fiber cables.\nThe data utilized in this study were obtained from a monitoring schedule spanning 18 days as shown in Table 1. The total length of the LUHSR between Lanzhou and Urumqi is 1777 km. In the trip from Lanzhou to Urumqi, the high-speed train\nstops by 14 stations and travels cross 13 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 13th); in trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou, the high-speed train stops by 15 stations and travels cross 14 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 14th). During the monitoring\nperiod, the train operated at its normal speed around 200–250 km/h. The sampling rate for all the sensors was set at 5000\nSince the train wheels were lathed (lathing is a process to make wheels perfectly rounded) during the monitoring period,\nthe recorded data contain information in line with two different states (before lathing and after lathing). The wheels can be considered as potentially unhealthy (defective) before lathing and as healthy after lathing. To verify the effectiveness of theproposed real-time defect detection methodology, the strain monitoring data obtained from the bogies before and afterThe train’s dynamic responses may be influenced by different subgrade conditions of the railroad, such as ground, tunnel,\nand bridge. To eliminate the effects of different railroad conditions, the strain data recorded from the same railroad sectionbefore and after lathing, are used in each scenario. In addition, the passenger loads in different trips are deemed statistically identical and the speed of train is assumed to be constant as in normal operation. Without loss of generality, the monitoring\ndata respectively obtained from two typical railroad sections (1st and 14th) in the trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou are chosen to illustrate the proposed real-time defect detection methodology, which are from the strain gauge (MS3-7) deployed at the For the sake of brevity, the monitoring data collected from the 1st railroad section are denoted as Case 1, while those from the 14th railroad section are denoted as Case 2. Firstly, the measured strain is converted to stress for the subsequent stress\nrange calculation. For the strain gauges mounted on the steel surface, the conversion of the measured strain to stress is made by rs ¼ Ee, where E is the elasticity modulus of steel and e is the strain after eliminating the effect of varying temperatures.where em is the measured strain, T m is the measured temperature in the vicinity of the strain sensor, T 0 is the temperature at\nthe installation, and a1 is a constant coefficient. In our case, the original temperature is 4, i.e., T 0 ¼ 4. The results of temperature compensation are demonstrated in Fig. 5. It is obvious that the trend in strain responses caused by temperature\nAfterwards, the stress ranges are extracted from the monitoring-derived stress data by the application of the rainflow\ncounting algorithm. From each stress cycle, the stress range Sa is obtained by calculating the difference between the maximum stress rmax and the minimum stress rmin measured in that stress cycle, i.e., Sa ¼ rmax rmin. More details on the stress ranges extraction are given in . The stress ranges with amplitudes lower than 1 MPa need to be culled because the majority are caused by noise. To decrease the uncertainty arising from the measurement facilities, the average stress ranges for\nevery ten minutes are used as the target quantities. Due to the different lengths of the two selected railroad sections (1st and 14th), the traveling time of the train in each section is also different. This results in different data lengths. The data\nlengths of the average stress ranges in Case 1 and Case 2 are 110 and 90, respectively. Figs. and 7 show the original measured strain responses before and after lathing in Case 1 and Case 2, respectively.Following the implementation procedures mentioned before, the defect detection results for Case 1 are demonstrated in\nFigs. and 9. Fig. 8(a) shows the average stress range (red point) together with 1-step ahead prediction (blue solid line) and\nthe corresponding 90% prediction interval (grey shadow). It is observed that, although some observations at the time interval t 2 fall outside the 90% prediction interval, only the Bayes factor at time t ¼ 55 exceeds the established threshold of Hmin ¼ 10 as shown in Fig. 9(a). It is thus judged as an outlier (marked as h). The reason is that because when applying the proposed approach, the shift parameter is set as h ¼ 1:645rt, resulting in the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt while the other\nfour observations are still within the uncertainty limit. On the other hand, Fig. 9(b)–(c) shows the results of the maximum cumulative Bayes factor and the corresponding run length for change detection. It is seen that the maximum cumulative\nBayes factor values at time instants t ¼ 56; 57 and 58 are larger than the threshold of Lmin ¼ 10, while merely the run length at instant t ¼ 58 surpasses the threshold of lmin ¼ 4. Apparently, this observation at time t ¼ 58 fulfills the conditions of change-point detection causing an alarm to be issued (i.e., TON ¼ 58). The identified real occurrence time of change-point is t ¼ 55 (i.e., TOC ¼ 58 4 þ 1 ¼ 55), which coincides well with the actual time point of lathing the wheels. In accordance\nwith the real-time identification of change-point occurrence, the prediction model is refined by altering the guessed mean\nvalue at TOC, as shown in Fig. 8(b). The predictions near TOC in the refined model obviously agree well with the actual observations, thus offering a better prediction performance than that of the original model.\nThe results of defect detection by means of Bayesian hypothesis testing are illustrated in Fig. 9(d). The discrimination between ‘‘healthy” and ‘‘defective” is quantified by the logarithm value of Bayes factor. It is seen from Fig. 9(d) that the vast\nmajority of logarithm values of Bayes factor before TOC are nearly zero and below the threshold level (dotted red line), which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘healthy state” (no defect). This is consistent with the actual health condition and thus validatesthe capability of the Bayesian hypothesis testing. On the contrary, all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than 2, meaning that the corresponding Bayes factor values exceed 100. According to the classification of Bayes factor stipulated in Sub-section 3.1, this result (H > 100) favors the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity is classified as ‘‘decisive”. Indeed, wheels immediately before being sent to depot for lathing were in the state of ‘heavily defective’.\nMaking use of Eq. (21), the probabilities of damage after TOC are obtained as 100%, that is, the wheels are identified as defective with a very high confidence.\nThe defect detection results for Case 2 are similar to Case 1, and are illustrated in Figs. and 11. As seen in Fig. 11(a)–(c)\nno outlier exists throughout the whole period, but a change-point is identified, of which the time of notification is t ¼ 44 (i.e.,\nTON ¼ 44) and the real time of occurrence is t ¼ 41 (i.e., TOC ¼ 44 4 þ 1 ¼ 41). The result matches well with the actual time point when wheel lathing is inflicted. For the predictions near the change-point, the modified prediction model\n(Fig. 10(b)) offers a better performance than the original model (Fig. 10(a)). As illustrated in Fig. 11(d), all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than the threshold (dotted red line), whereas the values before TOC are within thethreshold line. The values of Bayes factor after TOC are obtained to be higher than 100 (H > 100) and the corresponding probabilities of damage are approximately 100%, which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity\nApart from the accuracy of the proposed approach, the computational efficiency is also of concern. The algorithmic implementation is performed on a Lenovo ThinkCentre M720t desktop (Lenovo, Beijing, China) with Dual Intel Core i7-8700 processor (Intel, California, USA) and 24 GB of memory. The computation times consumed in Case 1 and Case 2 are 4.0109 s and\n3.7704 s respectively. In this sense, it realizes the detection of wheel defects in real time.5. ConclusionsA novel methodology for real-time defect detection of high-speed train wheels using Bayesian forecasting and dynamic linear model (DLM) has been developed and validated in this study. First, the DLM is formulated to approximate the actual\nframework. Afterwards, three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) are elicited for outlier detection and change-point detection. After the change-point has been confirmed, damage assessment is executed by the Bayesian hypothesis testing of the sequential observations before and after the change-point. Due to accommodating the dynamic evolution process and the statistical nature of the method, the proposed approach not only possesses the ability of real-time damage detection, but also enables damage quantification (through classifying the range of Bayes factor) and uncertainty assessment (through calculating the probability of damage). The methodology is illustrated by using the onlinelathing). In the two cases addressed, wheel defects are successfully identified, hence validating the effectiveness of the developed method. The quantitative results about the damage extent and confidence would provide useful information helping to\nmake cost-effective, risk-based decisions with the aim of maintaining the operation safety of high-speed rail.\nDespite the proposed methodology being developed for wheel defect detection of high-speed trains, it can also be applied to low-speed passenger and freight trains as well as extended to SHM for a wide variety of civil infrastructure (e.g., bridges,\nbuildings and tunnels) when vibration signals are available via monitoring. In this study, the second-order polynomial DLM\nis employed to model the stress ranges, which only considers the change of stress range level and trend. However, most longterm SHM data, especially long-term strain monitoring data, are generally contaminated by trend, seasonal (cyclical) and\nregression effects, which require a more complex model. The Bayesian DLM enables the modeling of time-dependent responses of a structure by integrating appropriate components, for instance, the response with cyclical characteristics\ncan be depicted by embedding a seasonal (cyclical) component. Thus, in accordance with the nature of monitoring data,\nan appropriate Bayesian DLM enabling to describe time series data of different features, can be formulated for damage detection of a variety of structures subject to different operational/environmental conditions.Administrative Region, China (Project No. PolyU 152024/17E).

The rapid\ngrowth of HSR, however, has posed great challenges regarding operation safety, reliability\nand ride comfort. Irregular wheel defects can induce high-magnitude impact forces hindering safety and ride comfort of HSR and may also cause damage to rail tracks and vehicles.real time. The proposed methodology embraces logics for (i) prognosis, (ii) potential outlier\ndetection, (iii) identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and (iv) quantification of damage extent and uncertainty. Relying on the strain monitoring data acquired from high-speed train bogies, the Bayesian DLM for characterizing the actual stress ranges is established, by which one-step forecast distribution is elicited before proceeding to the\nnext observation. The detection of change-point is executed by comparing the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM) and an alternative model\n(the mean value is shifted by a prescribed offset) to determine which better fits the actual observation.

Rail accidents were occasionally caused by failures such as severe defects or fatigue of railway components. To maintain a good service quality and operation safety, it is paramount to develop\nonline monitoring techniques that not only quickly recognize faults of mission-critical HSR components but also can anticipate of long-term mechanisms and gradual deterioration in performance.\nWheelsets in a high-speed train are physically connected with and controlled by the bogie system which corrects alignment for stable running and reduces the vibration caused by wheel-rail interaction . However, the wheel performance\nprogressively deteriorates in different mechanisms (e.g., wheel flat and wheel polygonization) during the routine operation of a high-speed train . Wheel performance deterioration increases stresses experienced by the bogie system. In addition,\nthe increased stress within bogie frames caused by wheel quality deterioration can be unexpectedly large, thus posing a serious threat to the operation safety of concerned trains. According to the statistics of train accidents caused by failure in\nmechanical components during 2004 to 2007 in the United States, the wheelsets faults are the most cause with a rate of\n44.7% . Therefore, the railway managers are keen to keep wheels in an adequate condition and detect potential failure\nas soon as possible. For railway wheels, there are three different ways of estimating the conditions: physical modeling, statistical modeling and condition monitoring . However, the first two ways are not applicable to in-service\nwheel condition assessment, and in contrast, the third way is most feasible for wheel condition estimation. The monitoring approaches available to wheel defect detection can be divided into in-workshop inspection and in-service detection . The\nlatter provides the real-time data required for maintenance planning, while the former is normally carried out at workshops at fixed intervals. The commonly used in-workshop methods for wheel defect inspection include the ultrasonic techniques, infrared camera and magnetic methods . In-service monitoring approaches can be categorized as on-board and wayside methods. The on-board methods implement sensors on the train and continuously obtain comprehensive data from\nthe system. The methods of this category include magnetic technique , ultrasonic technique , acoustic technique, and vibration technique . On the other hand, wayside methods attempt to detect the wheel or vehicle performance\nby installing sensors on the rail or its surrounding areas. Such indirect measurements give rise to limited information of the wheel condition while they can monitor all train wheels going by with using only one or a few sensors. According to the type\nof sensors used, wayside detection approaches include strain sensing technology , fiber optic sensing technology ,\nultrasonic technique , vibration technique , acoustic emission , lasers and high-speed cameras . However,\nthe study on data interpretation techniques enabling the extraction of defect-sensitive features is far from sufficient.\nBayesian dynamic linear model (DLM) is an elegant system approach to handling time series data from a Bayesian perspective, which originates from the field of applied statistics and is extensively used in other fields such as economics\nand engineering [25–30]. The Bayesian DLM treats the time series as the output of a dynamic system perturbed by random disturbances. It is suitable for modeling both univariate and multivariate time series, and also for representing the structural changes, non-stationarity and irregular patterns . Unlike the classical time series method which assumes a fixed relationship between the dependent variables (response variables) and the independent variables (regressors), the DLM considers\nthe relationship changes over time and is able to directly capture time series data features, such as trend, seasonality,\nand regression effects. Moreover, the DLM allows for descriptions of temporary or permanent shifts in time series parameters that occur abruptly, which are necessary for outlier and damage detection in structural health monitoring (SHM) paradigms. Recently, Goulet and his collaborator adopted the Bayesian DLM theory in SHM to model the time-dependent\nresponses of structures by breaking them into subcomponents. In the perspective of real-time damage detection, only few studies are available. The first attempt was conducted by Lipowsky et al. with the development of a Bayesian DLM-based\nreal-time detection algorithm to evaluate the performance of a gas turbine using simulated data. Later on, Wang et al.\nand Zhang et al. adopted the above algorithm for detecting high-speed train defects by using real-world monitoring\ndata. In the previous studies, however, the real-time detection algorithm devised possesses only outlier identification and\nchange detection abilities, without the function of damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.context of Bayesian DLM, which incorporates logics for prognosis, potential outlier detection, identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and damage extent and uncertainty quantification. The Bayesian DLM is considered as a tool\nfor time series analysis, while Bayesian forecasting is executed to enable the calculation of one-step ahead forecast distribution. The change-point detection is performed by checking the current observation against the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM for current instant) as well as against an alternative model of which the mean value\nis shifted by a prescribed offset. The detection rule is that if the alternative model better fits the actual observation, a potential change is signaled. To further determine whether such an observation is only an outlier or the beginning of an actual\nchange (change-point), a specific logic is developed by introducing the Bayes factor and the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.\nThe main contributions of this study are the provision of: (i) a formula which not only enables the modeling of actual framework; (ii) three metrics (i.e., the Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) to allow for outlier\nand change-point detection in real-time manner; and (iii) an efficient way for damage extent assessment and uncertainty\nquantification. The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the Bayesian DLM theory and an elaboration of the Bayesian forecasting philosophy. Section 3 presents the defect detection methodology that incorporates logics for\noutlier detection, change-point identification, and damage assessment. In Section 4, two case studies making use of timeseries strain data acquired by fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors affixed on the bogies of an in-service high-speed train are offered to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the proposed methodology. Finally, conclusions are drawn in2. Bayesian DLM and forecastingThe Bayesian DLM is a kind of process-based Bayesian prediction model which provides a flexible way to intuitively capture how processes evolve over time. It consists of two basic equations: an observation (measurement) equation and a system (evolution) equation . The observation (measurement) equation describes the relationship between the observed\nrandom vectors with mean zero and unknown covariance matrices V t and W t. The DLM defined above amounts to treating ht\nrange level at time t, and at represents the stress range change between time t 1 and t. v t is the zero-mean Gaussian random variable representing the error of measurement at moment t. x1t and x2t are both zero-mean Gaussian random variables representing the evolution of DLM from time t 1 to t. In association with the form of DLM in Equation (1), we haveThe Bayesian forecasting philosophy is based on the description of an observed process using its probability density function (PDF). As implied by the name, the Bayesian forecasting approach commences from Bayes’ theorem, hence enabling the calculation of conditional probabilities. The details of using DLM for the recursive one-step ahead forecasting of the (posterior) distribution of monitoring-derived stress ranges under the Bayesian framework are presented as follows\nNote that in Step 4, Atþ1 is the adaptive coefficient which can be viewed as the information tuner. It scales the correction term according to the relative variances of the prior and likelihood, as measured by Rtþ1=Q tþ1 and regressor value Ftþ1. etþ1 is\nthe one-step forward forecast error, the difference between the observed value ytþ1 and its expectation f tþ1. More details\nabout the recursive one-step ahead forecast method can be found in .3. Defect detection methodologyThe proposed defect detection methodology contains three logical processes: outlier detection, change-point detection,\nand damage assessment. By comparing the real-time measurement with the predicted values, the named outlier detection and change-point detection are devised to determine whether the measurement is a single outlier or the first observation of a remarkable change, the former being executed by calculating the Bayes factor, while the latter being based on the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once a change-point is affirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for further damagePotential outlier detection is the first step in the process of the proposed defect detection approach, accomplished by the Bayes factor calculation. Bayes factor is advocated because of its straightforward and natural interpretation of evidence afforded by data. At every time step t, the Bayesian DLM can yield a PDF for the next measurement, labeled as M0. Meanwhile, an artificial alternative model labeled as M1 is defined by shifting the mean of M0 by +h. The underlying idea of outlier\ndetection is to check the current observation against both M0 and M1. For each time step t, the Bayes factor is the ratio of thewhere yt is the measurement at time t and Dt1 refers to the history information up to time t 1. In the case of Gaussianwhere h is the shift value; yt is the observation value; f t and rt are the mean and standard deviation of the forecasting distribution for observation at time t. A Bayes factor H ¼ 1 indicates that the probability of the observation derived from model M1 is identical to the probability of that derived from Model M0. For better quantitative comparison between any two models, Jeffreys suggested interpreting the Bayes factor as a scale of evidence and provided descriptive statements although\nthe partitions are somewhat arbitrary. According to his suggestion, a Bayes factor can be divided into several intervals for assessing the significance of discrimination: 1 < H < 3 is ‘barely worth mentioning’, 3 < H < 10 is ‘substantial’,\n10 < H < 30 is ‘strong’, 30 < H < 100 is ‘very strong’, and H > 100 is ‘decisive’. In this study, Hmin ¼ 10 is set as a threshold\nAfter the confirmation of Hmin and h, an uncertainty limit (ucl) can be procured by the following equationFor instance, when the confidence level a and threshold of Bayes factor Hmin are set as 90% and 10 respectively, the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt. Thus, an observation is diagnosed as an outlier if its deviation from the mean value of M0 is larger\nWith the Bayes factor defined in Equation (9), only outliers with a positive deviation can be detected. To enable the outliers with negative deviation to be detected as well, a second Bayes factor is defined asIn the automatic monitoring process, both the Bayes factors H1;t and H2;t should be examined in parallel to enable thebehavior, rather than judgments based on long past performances. Change-point is an abrupt variation in time series data,\nrepresenting a transition that occurs between states. Change-point detection aims to detect abrupt change in the generative\nprocess of sequential data. It is assumed that a sequence of observations y1; ; yT could be divided into several nonoverlapping partitions, e.g. dataset j 1, dataset j, and dataset j + 1 as shown in Fig. 2. The delineations between partitions\nare known as change-points (e.g. TOC j 1 and TOC j); the goal of change-point detection is the determination of where the\nboundary of two adjacent partitions is located in a sequence of observations. Change-point detection approaches can be classified into offline and online methods. The former needs to observe the whole sequential observations before aiming to make\ninference on the generative process of the sequence [37–40], wheras the latter aims to update the inference at each time step\nwith the newly acquired measurements from the sequence [41–43]. In particular, the Bayesian online change-point detection methods are based on computing the probability distribution of the run length.differentiate between the single-point outlier and the beginning of a continual change. To overcome this problem, cumulative Bayes factor (local Bayes factors) is recommended to detect change-point(s) in the sequence of observations, by definingwhere lmax is the maximum number of Bayes factors taken into account. Unlike Bayes factor with implicitly no historical influence in the judgement, the consecutive Bayes factors collect evidence of change over a series of observation (from time\net al. . Akin to the Bayes factor threshold for outlier detection, the threshold of maximal cumulative Bayes factors is set as Lmin ¼ 10. If the conditions Lt > Lmin and lt > lmin occur simultaneously, an alarm of change is immediately issued at time t\n(time of notification, TON). The real time of occurrence (TOC) is (t lt þ 1), that is, TOC =t lt þ 1.Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is performed to assess damage extent and quantify the\nassociated uncertainty. The proposed approach directly quantifies the likelihoods of two scenarios (e.g., the sequential observations before and after the change-point), that is, ‘‘no fault” and ‘‘fault”, and the yielded results are easy to interpret. An\nadditional merit of the proposed approach is its ability to quantify the uncertainty in damage detection. Assume that the observed sequential data can be divided into two non-overlapping partitions, the first of which is regarded as healthy\nof the observations. Thus, the damage detection problem becomes the test of H0 : l ¼ l0 versus H1 : l–l0 with\nWith the above, damage detection can be achieved by means of Bayes factor which is defined as the ratio of the probability of observations given the alternate hypothesis to the probability of observations given the null hypothesiswhere D ¼ yf 1; ; yng refers to the observed data. It is proven to bewhere refers to the mean of the observed data fy1; ; yng. If no prior information is available, the initial mean and variance can be set as q ¼ l0 and s ¼ r 0 [][. The two assumptions take the prior mean and variance in the alternative hypothesis as]where z ¼ pfn **f** i ffi l0 0 [ At each time step (i.e.,][ n][=1), the Bayes factor][ B][ is larger for the larger values of][ z][j j][, which is reasonable]and easy to interpret. The logarithm of the Bayes factor, for convenience of comparison among a larger of values, is derived asIf the Bayes factor B10 is larger than 1, the implication is that the observed data provide evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis H1 (i.e., the structure is damaged). Otherwise, the observed data are judged to support the null hypothesis H0 (i.e.,\nthe structure is healthy). As with the previous threshold, B10 10 is set as a threshold for damage indication.\nIntegrating together the outlier detection, change-point detection and damage assessment, the implementation procedures of the proposed methodology are shown in Fig. 3. Beginning at time t, the single Bayes factor is firstly evaluated to\njudge whether yt is an outlier. If not, the maximum cumulative Bayes factor Lt and run length lt for change-point detection are calculated. Once a change-point is detected, the intervention is carried out by resetting the time to the time of occurrence\n(i.e., TOC = t lt þ 1) and by adjusting the mean value of M0 to the observation yt (i.e., f t ¼ yt), and the subsequent analysis\nwill then be started at TOC. Meanwhile, Bayesian hypothesis testing is executed for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification from the current TOC to the next TOC.4. Application to in-service monitoring data of high-speed trainAn onboard monitoring system has been designed and implemented on an in-service high-speed passenger train running on the Lanzhou-Urumqi High-Speed Railway (LUHSR) in China . As shown in Fig. 4, the monitoring system is composed\nof a total of 52 FBG strain sensors, 4 FBG temperature sensors, 11 accelerometers (tri-axial) and 1 noise sensor deployed on both motor and trailer bogies. Also, one tri-axial FBG accelerometer, one video camera and two GPS sensors are installed inside a train carriage. As the present work is focused on the real-time detection of potentially defective wheels by using strain monitoring data from bogies, only the deployment of strain sensors is concerned. The strain sensors are mounted\non 4 measurement zones of the bogies: (i) the zone with the action of high loads; (ii) the stress transmission zone; (iii)\nthe zone with high responses predicted by finite element analysis; and (iv) welded joints. FBG strain (and temperature) sensors are deployed and attached to the surface of the train bogie with industrial glue and tapes, and connected to the interrogator (data logger) with laptop inside the train carriage through optical fiber cables.\nThe data utilized in this study were obtained from a monitoring schedule spanning 18 days as shown in Table 1. The total length of the LUHSR between Lanzhou and Urumqi is 1777 km. In the trip from Lanzhou to Urumqi, the high-speed train\nstops by 14 stations and travels cross 13 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 13th); in trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou, the high-speed train stops by 15 stations and travels cross 14 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 14th). During the monitoring\nperiod, the train operated at its normal speed around 200–250 km/h. The sampling rate for all the sensors was set at 5000\nSince the train wheels were lathed (lathing is a process to make wheels perfectly rounded) during the monitoring period,\nthe recorded data contain information in line with two different states (before lathing and after lathing). The wheels can be considered as potentially unhealthy (defective) before lathing and as healthy after lathing. To verify the effectiveness of theproposed real-time defect detection methodology, the strain monitoring data obtained from the bogies before and afterThe train’s dynamic responses may be influenced by different subgrade conditions of the railroad, such as ground, tunnel,\nand bridge. To eliminate the effects of different railroad conditions, the strain data recorded from the same railroad sectionbefore and after lathing, are used in each scenario. In addition, the passenger loads in different trips are deemed statistically identical and the speed of train is assumed to be constant as in normal operation. Without loss of generality, the monitoring\ndata respectively obtained from two typical railroad sections (1st and 14th) in the trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou are chosen to illustrate the proposed real-time defect detection methodology, which are from the strain gauge (MS3-7) deployed at the For the sake of brevity, the monitoring data collected from the 1st railroad section are denoted as Case 1, while those from the 14th railroad section are denoted as Case 2. Firstly, the measured strain is converted to stress for the subsequent stress\nrange calculation. For the strain gauges mounted on the steel surface, the conversion of the measured strain to stress is made by rs ¼ Ee, where E is the elasticity modulus of steel and e is the strain after eliminating the effect of varying temperatures.where em is the measured strain, T m is the measured temperature in the vicinity of the strain sensor, T 0 is the temperature at\nthe installation, and a1 is a constant coefficient. In our case, the original temperature is 4, i.e., T 0 ¼ 4. The results of temperature compensation are demonstrated in Fig. 5. It is obvious that the trend in strain responses caused by temperature\nAfterwards, the stress ranges are extracted from the monitoring-derived stress data by the application of the rainflow\ncounting algorithm. From each stress cycle, the stress range Sa is obtained by calculating the difference between the maximum stress rmax and the minimum stress rmin measured in that stress cycle, i.e., Sa ¼ rmax rmin. More details on the stress ranges extraction are given in . The stress ranges with amplitudes lower than 1 MPa need to be culled because the majority are caused by noise. To decrease the uncertainty arising from the measurement facilities, the average stress ranges for\nevery ten minutes are used as the target quantities. Due to the different lengths of the two selected railroad sections (1st and 14th), the traveling time of the train in each section is also different. This results in different data lengths. The data\nlengths of the average stress ranges in Case 1 and Case 2 are 110 and 90, respectively. Figs. and 7 show the original measured strain responses before and after lathing in Case 1 and Case 2, respectively.Following the implementation procedures mentioned before, the defect detection results for Case 1 are demonstrated in\nFigs. and 9. Fig. 8(a) shows the average stress range (red point) together with 1-step ahead prediction (blue solid line) and\nthe corresponding 90% prediction interval (grey shadow). It is observed that, although some observations at the time interval t 2 fall outside the 90% prediction interval, only the Bayes factor at time t ¼ 55 exceeds the established threshold of Hmin ¼ 10 as shown in Fig. 9(a). It is thus judged as an outlier (marked as h). The reason is that because when applying the proposed approach, the shift parameter is set as h ¼ 1:645rt, resulting in the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt while the other\nfour observations are still within the uncertainty limit. On the other hand, Fig. 9(b)–(c) shows the results of the maximum cumulative Bayes factor and the corresponding run length for change detection. It is seen that the maximum cumulative\nBayes factor values at time instants t ¼ 56; 57 and 58 are larger than the threshold of Lmin ¼ 10, while merely the run length at instant t ¼ 58 surpasses the threshold of lmin ¼ 4. Apparently, this observation at time t ¼ 58 fulfills the conditions of change-point detection causing an alarm to be issued (i.e., TON ¼ 58). The identified real occurrence time of change-point is t ¼ 55 (i.e., TOC ¼ 58 4 þ 1 ¼ 55), which coincides well with the actual time point of lathing the wheels. In accordance\nwith the real-time identification of change-point occurrence, the prediction model is refined by altering the guessed mean\nvalue at TOC, as shown in Fig. 8(b). The predictions near TOC in the refined model obviously agree well with the actual observations, thus offering a better prediction performance than that of the original model.\nThe results of defect detection by means of Bayesian hypothesis testing are illustrated in Fig. 9(d). The discrimination between ‘‘healthy” and ‘‘defective” is quantified by the logarithm value of Bayes factor. It is seen from Fig. 9(d) that the vast\nmajority of logarithm values of Bayes factor before TOC are nearly zero and below the threshold level (dotted red line), which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘healthy state” (no defect). This is consistent with the actual health condition and thus validatesthe capability of the Bayesian hypothesis testing. On the contrary, all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than 2, meaning that the corresponding Bayes factor values exceed 100. According to the classification of Bayes factor stipulated in Sub-section 3.1, this result (H > 100) favors the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity is classified as ‘‘decisive”. Indeed, wheels immediately before being sent to depot for lathing were in the state of ‘heavily defective’.\nMaking use of Eq. (21), the probabilities of damage after TOC are obtained as 100%, that is, the wheels are identified as defective with a very high confidence.\nThe defect detection results for Case 2 are similar to Case 1, and are illustrated in Figs. and 11. As seen in Fig. 11(a)–(c)\nno outlier exists throughout the whole period, but a change-point is identified, of which the time of notification is t ¼ 44 (i.e.,\nTON ¼ 44) and the real time of occurrence is t ¼ 41 (i.e., TOC ¼ 44 4 þ 1 ¼ 41). The result matches well with the actual time point when wheel lathing is inflicted. For the predictions near the change-point, the modified prediction model\n(Fig. 10(b)) offers a better performance than the original model (Fig. 10(a)). As illustrated in Fig. 11(d), all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than the threshold (dotted red line), whereas the values before TOC are within thethreshold line. The values of Bayes factor after TOC are obtained to be higher than 100 (H > 100) and the corresponding probabilities of damage are approximately 100%, which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity\nApart from the accuracy of the proposed approach, the computational efficiency is also of concern. The algorithmic implementation is performed on a Lenovo ThinkCentre M720t desktop (Lenovo, Beijing, China) with Dual Intel Core i7-8700 processor (Intel, California, USA) and 24 GB of memory. The computation times consumed in Case 1 and Case 2 are 4.0109 s and\n3.7704 s respectively. In this sense, it realizes the detection of wheel defects in real time.5. ConclusionsA novel methodology for real-time defect detection of high-speed train wheels using Bayesian forecasting and dynamic linear model (DLM) has been developed and validated in this study. First, the DLM is formulated to approximate the actual\nframework. Afterwards, three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) are elicited for outlier detection and change-point detection. After the change-point has been confirmed, damage assessment is executed by the Bayesian hypothesis testing of the sequential observations before and after the change-point. Due to accommodating the dynamic evolution process and the statistical nature of the method, the proposed approach not only possesses the ability of real-time damage detection, but also enables damage quantification (through classifying the range of Bayes factor) and uncertainty assessment (through calculating the probability of damage). The methodology is illustrated by using the onlinelathing). In the two cases addressed, wheel defects are successfully identified, hence validating the effectiveness of the developed method. The quantitative results about the damage extent and confidence would provide useful information helping to\nmake cost-effective, risk-based decisions with the aim of maintaining the operation safety of high-speed rail.\nDespite the proposed methodology being developed for wheel defect detection of high-speed trains, it can also be applied to low-speed passenger and freight trains as well as extended to SHM for a wide variety of civil infrastructure (e.g., bridges,\nbuildings and tunnels) when vibration signals are available via monitoring. In this study, the second-order polynomial DLM\nis employed to model the stress ranges, which only considers the change of stress range level and trend. However, most longterm SHM data, especially long-term strain monitoring data, are generally contaminated by trend, seasonal (cyclical) and\nregression effects, which require a more complex model. The Bayesian DLM enables the modeling of time-dependent responses of a structure by integrating appropriate components, for instance, the response with cyclical characteristics\ncan be depicted by embedding a seasonal (cyclical) component. Thus, in accordance with the nature of monitoring data,\nan appropriate Bayesian DLM enabling to describe time series data of different features, can be formulated for damage detection of a variety of structures subject to different operational/environmental conditions.Administrative Region, China (Project No. PolyU 152024/17E).

Irregular wheel defects can induce high-magnitude impact forces hindering safety and ride comfort of HSR and may also cause damage to rail tracks and vehicles.real time. The proposed methodology embraces logics for (i) prognosis, (ii) potential outlier\ndetection, (iii) identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and (iv) quantification of damage extent and uncertainty. Relying on the strain monitoring data acquired from high-speed train bogies, the Bayesian DLM for characterizing the actual stress ranges is established, by which one-step forecast distribution is elicited before proceeding to the\nnext observation. The detection of change-point is executed by comparing the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM) and an alternative model\n(the mean value is shifted by a prescribed offset) to determine which better fits the actual observation. If the comparison results are in favor of the alternative model, it is claimed that a potential change has occurred. Whether such an observation is an outlier or the beginning of a genuine change (change-point), three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum\ncumulative Bayes factor and run length) are performed for further identification.

Rail accidents were occasionally caused by failures such as severe defects or fatigue of railway components. To maintain a good service quality and operation safety, it is paramount to develop\nonline monitoring techniques that not only quickly recognize faults of mission-critical HSR components but also can anticipate of long-term mechanisms and gradual deterioration in performance.\nWheelsets in a high-speed train are physically connected with and controlled by the bogie system which corrects alignment for stable running and reduces the vibration caused by wheel-rail interaction . However, the wheel performance\nprogressively deteriorates in different mechanisms (e.g., wheel flat and wheel polygonization) during the routine operation of a high-speed train . Wheel performance deterioration increases stresses experienced by the bogie system. In addition,\nthe increased stress within bogie frames caused by wheel quality deterioration can be unexpectedly large, thus posing a serious threat to the operation safety of concerned trains. According to the statistics of train accidents caused by failure in\nmechanical components during 2004 to 2007 in the United States, the wheelsets faults are the most cause with a rate of\n44.7% . Therefore, the railway managers are keen to keep wheels in an adequate condition and detect potential failure\nas soon as possible. For railway wheels, there are three different ways of estimating the conditions: physical modeling, statistical modeling and condition monitoring . However, the first two ways are not applicable to in-service\nwheel condition assessment, and in contrast, the third way is most feasible for wheel condition estimation. The monitoring approaches available to wheel defect detection can be divided into in-workshop inspection and in-service detection . The\nlatter provides the real-time data required for maintenance planning, while the former is normally carried out at workshops at fixed intervals. The commonly used in-workshop methods for wheel defect inspection include the ultrasonic techniques, infrared camera and magnetic methods . In-service monitoring approaches can be categorized as on-board and wayside methods. The on-board methods implement sensors on the train and continuously obtain comprehensive data from\nthe system. The methods of this category include magnetic technique , ultrasonic technique , acoustic technique, and vibration technique . On the other hand, wayside methods attempt to detect the wheel or vehicle performance\nby installing sensors on the rail or its surrounding areas. Such indirect measurements give rise to limited information of the wheel condition while they can monitor all train wheels going by with using only one or a few sensors. According to the type\nof sensors used, wayside detection approaches include strain sensing technology , fiber optic sensing technology ,\nultrasonic technique , vibration technique , acoustic emission , lasers and high-speed cameras . However,\nthe study on data interpretation techniques enabling the extraction of defect-sensitive features is far from sufficient.\nBayesian dynamic linear model (DLM) is an elegant system approach to handling time series data from a Bayesian perspective, which originates from the field of applied statistics and is extensively used in other fields such as economics\nand engineering [25–30]. The Bayesian DLM treats the time series as the output of a dynamic system perturbed by random disturbances. It is suitable for modeling both univariate and multivariate time series, and also for representing the structural changes, non-stationarity and irregular patterns . Unlike the classical time series method which assumes a fixed relationship between the dependent variables (response variables) and the independent variables (regressors), the DLM considers\nthe relationship changes over time and is able to directly capture time series data features, such as trend, seasonality,\nand regression effects. Moreover, the DLM allows for descriptions of temporary or permanent shifts in time series parameters that occur abruptly, which are necessary for outlier and damage detection in structural health monitoring (SHM) paradigms. Recently, Goulet and his collaborator adopted the Bayesian DLM theory in SHM to model the time-dependent\nresponses of structures by breaking them into subcomponents. In the perspective of real-time damage detection, only few studies are available. The first attempt was conducted by Lipowsky et al. with the development of a Bayesian DLM-based\nreal-time detection algorithm to evaluate the performance of a gas turbine using simulated data. Later on, Wang et al.\nand Zhang et al. adopted the above algorithm for detecting high-speed train defects by using real-world monitoring\ndata. In the previous studies, however, the real-time detection algorithm devised possesses only outlier identification and\nchange detection abilities, without the function of damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.context of Bayesian DLM, which incorporates logics for prognosis, potential outlier detection, identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and damage extent and uncertainty quantification. The Bayesian DLM is considered as a tool\nfor time series analysis, while Bayesian forecasting is executed to enable the calculation of one-step ahead forecast distribution. The change-point detection is performed by checking the current observation against the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM for current instant) as well as against an alternative model of which the mean value\nis shifted by a prescribed offset. The detection rule is that if the alternative model better fits the actual observation, a potential change is signaled. To further determine whether such an observation is only an outlier or the beginning of an actual\nchange (change-point), a specific logic is developed by introducing the Bayes factor and the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.\nThe main contributions of this study are the provision of: (i) a formula which not only enables the modeling of actual framework; (ii) three metrics (i.e., the Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) to allow for outlier\nand change-point detection in real-time manner; and (iii) an efficient way for damage extent assessment and uncertainty\nquantification. The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the Bayesian DLM theory and an elaboration of the Bayesian forecasting philosophy. Section 3 presents the defect detection methodology that incorporates logics for\noutlier detection, change-point identification, and damage assessment. In Section 4, two case studies making use of timeseries strain data acquired by fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors affixed on the bogies of an in-service high-speed train are offered to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the proposed methodology. Finally, conclusions are drawn in2. Bayesian DLM and forecastingThe Bayesian DLM is a kind of process-based Bayesian prediction model which provides a flexible way to intuitively capture how processes evolve over time. It consists of two basic equations: an observation (measurement) equation and a system (evolution) equation . The observation (measurement) equation describes the relationship between the observed\nrandom vectors with mean zero and unknown covariance matrices V t and W t. The DLM defined above amounts to treating ht\nrange level at time t, and at represents the stress range change between time t 1 and t. v t is the zero-mean Gaussian random variable representing the error of measurement at moment t. x1t and x2t are both zero-mean Gaussian random variables representing the evolution of DLM from time t 1 to t. In association with the form of DLM in Equation (1), we haveThe Bayesian forecasting philosophy is based on the description of an observed process using its probability density function (PDF). As implied by the name, the Bayesian forecasting approach commences from Bayes’ theorem, hence enabling the calculation of conditional probabilities. The details of using DLM for the recursive one-step ahead forecasting of the (posterior) distribution of monitoring-derived stress ranges under the Bayesian framework are presented as follows\nNote that in Step 4, Atþ1 is the adaptive coefficient which can be viewed as the information tuner. It scales the correction term according to the relative variances of the prior and likelihood, as measured by Rtþ1=Q tþ1 and regressor value Ftþ1. etþ1 is\nthe one-step forward forecast error, the difference between the observed value ytþ1 and its expectation f tþ1. More details\nabout the recursive one-step ahead forecast method can be found in .3. Defect detection methodologyThe proposed defect detection methodology contains three logical processes: outlier detection, change-point detection,\nand damage assessment. By comparing the real-time measurement with the predicted values, the named outlier detection and change-point detection are devised to determine whether the measurement is a single outlier or the first observation of a remarkable change, the former being executed by calculating the Bayes factor, while the latter being based on the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once a change-point is affirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for further damagePotential outlier detection is the first step in the process of the proposed defect detection approach, accomplished by the Bayes factor calculation. Bayes factor is advocated because of its straightforward and natural interpretation of evidence afforded by data. At every time step t, the Bayesian DLM can yield a PDF for the next measurement, labeled as M0. Meanwhile, an artificial alternative model labeled as M1 is defined by shifting the mean of M0 by +h. The underlying idea of outlier\ndetection is to check the current observation against both M0 and M1. For each time step t, the Bayes factor is the ratio of thewhere yt is the measurement at time t and Dt1 refers to the history information up to time t 1. In the case of Gaussianwhere h is the shift value; yt is the observation value; f t and rt are the mean and standard deviation of the forecasting distribution for observation at time t. A Bayes factor H ¼ 1 indicates that the probability of the observation derived from model M1 is identical to the probability of that derived from Model M0. For better quantitative comparison between any two models, Jeffreys suggested interpreting the Bayes factor as a scale of evidence and provided descriptive statements although\nthe partitions are somewhat arbitrary. According to his suggestion, a Bayes factor can be divided into several intervals for assessing the significance of discrimination: 1 < H < 3 is ‘barely worth mentioning’, 3 < H < 10 is ‘substantial’,\n10 < H < 30 is ‘strong’, 30 < H < 100 is ‘very strong’, and H > 100 is ‘decisive’. In this study, Hmin ¼ 10 is set as a threshold\nAfter the confirmation of Hmin and h, an uncertainty limit (ucl) can be procured by the following equationFor instance, when the confidence level a and threshold of Bayes factor Hmin are set as 90% and 10 respectively, the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt. Thus, an observation is diagnosed as an outlier if its deviation from the mean value of M0 is larger\nWith the Bayes factor defined in Equation (9), only outliers with a positive deviation can be detected. To enable the outliers with negative deviation to be detected as well, a second Bayes factor is defined asIn the automatic monitoring process, both the Bayes factors H1;t and H2;t should be examined in parallel to enable thebehavior, rather than judgments based on long past performances. Change-point is an abrupt variation in time series data,\nrepresenting a transition that occurs between states. Change-point detection aims to detect abrupt change in the generative\nprocess of sequential data. It is assumed that a sequence of observations y1; ; yT could be divided into several nonoverlapping partitions, e.g. dataset j 1, dataset j, and dataset j + 1 as shown in Fig. 2. The delineations between partitions\nare known as change-points (e.g. TOC j 1 and TOC j); the goal of change-point detection is the determination of where the\nboundary of two adjacent partitions is located in a sequence of observations. Change-point detection approaches can be classified into offline and online methods. The former needs to observe the whole sequential observations before aiming to make\ninference on the generative process of the sequence [37–40], wheras the latter aims to update the inference at each time step\nwith the newly acquired measurements from the sequence [41–43]. In particular, the Bayesian online change-point detection methods are based on computing the probability distribution of the run length.differentiate between the single-point outlier and the beginning of a continual change. To overcome this problem, cumulative Bayes factor (local Bayes factors) is recommended to detect change-point(s) in the sequence of observations, by definingwhere lmax is the maximum number of Bayes factors taken into account. Unlike Bayes factor with implicitly no historical influence in the judgement, the consecutive Bayes factors collect evidence of change over a series of observation (from time\net al. . Akin to the Bayes factor threshold for outlier detection, the threshold of maximal cumulative Bayes factors is set as Lmin ¼ 10. If the conditions Lt > Lmin and lt > lmin occur simultaneously, an alarm of change is immediately issued at time t\n(time of notification, TON). The real time of occurrence (TOC) is (t lt þ 1), that is, TOC =t lt þ 1.Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is performed to assess damage extent and quantify the\nassociated uncertainty. The proposed approach directly quantifies the likelihoods of two scenarios (e.g., the sequential observations before and after the change-point), that is, ‘‘no fault” and ‘‘fault”, and the yielded results are easy to interpret. An\nadditional merit of the proposed approach is its ability to quantify the uncertainty in damage detection. Assume that the observed sequential data can be divided into two non-overlapping partitions, the first of which is regarded as healthy\nof the observations. Thus, the damage detection problem becomes the test of H0 : l ¼ l0 versus H1 : l–l0 with\nWith the above, damage detection can be achieved by means of Bayes factor which is defined as the ratio of the probability of observations given the alternate hypothesis to the probability of observations given the null hypothesiswhere D ¼ yf 1; ; yng refers to the observed data. It is proven to bewhere refers to the mean of the observed data fy1; ; yng. If no prior information is available, the initial mean and variance can be set as q ¼ l0 and s ¼ r 0 [][. The two assumptions take the prior mean and variance in the alternative hypothesis as]where z ¼ pfn **f** i ffi l0 0 [ At each time step (i.e.,][ n][=1), the Bayes factor][ B][ is larger for the larger values of][ z][j j][, which is reasonable]and easy to interpret. The logarithm of the Bayes factor, for convenience of comparison among a larger of values, is derived asIf the Bayes factor B10 is larger than 1, the implication is that the observed data provide evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis H1 (i.e., the structure is damaged). Otherwise, the observed data are judged to support the null hypothesis H0 (i.e.,\nthe structure is healthy). As with the previous threshold, B10 10 is set as a threshold for damage indication.\nIntegrating together the outlier detection, change-point detection and damage assessment, the implementation procedures of the proposed methodology are shown in Fig. 3. Beginning at time t, the single Bayes factor is firstly evaluated to\njudge whether yt is an outlier. If not, the maximum cumulative Bayes factor Lt and run length lt for change-point detection are calculated. Once a change-point is detected, the intervention is carried out by resetting the time to the time of occurrence\n(i.e., TOC = t lt þ 1) and by adjusting the mean value of M0 to the observation yt (i.e., f t ¼ yt), and the subsequent analysis\nwill then be started at TOC. Meanwhile, Bayesian hypothesis testing is executed for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification from the current TOC to the next TOC.4. Application to in-service monitoring data of high-speed trainAn onboard monitoring system has been designed and implemented on an in-service high-speed passenger train running on the Lanzhou-Urumqi High-Speed Railway (LUHSR) in China . As shown in Fig. 4, the monitoring system is composed\nof a total of 52 FBG strain sensors, 4 FBG temperature sensors, 11 accelerometers (tri-axial) and 1 noise sensor deployed on both motor and trailer bogies. Also, one tri-axial FBG accelerometer, one video camera and two GPS sensors are installed inside a train carriage. As the present work is focused on the real-time detection of potentially defective wheels by using strain monitoring data from bogies, only the deployment of strain sensors is concerned. The strain sensors are mounted\non 4 measurement zones of the bogies: (i) the zone with the action of high loads; (ii) the stress transmission zone; (iii)\nthe zone with high responses predicted by finite element analysis; and (iv) welded joints. FBG strain (and temperature) sensors are deployed and attached to the surface of the train bogie with industrial glue and tapes, and connected to the interrogator (data logger) with laptop inside the train carriage through optical fiber cables.\nThe data utilized in this study were obtained from a monitoring schedule spanning 18 days as shown in Table 1. The total length of the LUHSR between Lanzhou and Urumqi is 1777 km. In the trip from Lanzhou to Urumqi, the high-speed train\nstops by 14 stations and travels cross 13 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 13th); in trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou, the high-speed train stops by 15 stations and travels cross 14 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 14th). During the monitoring\nperiod, the train operated at its normal speed around 200–250 km/h. The sampling rate for all the sensors was set at 5000\nSince the train wheels were lathed (lathing is a process to make wheels perfectly rounded) during the monitoring period,\nthe recorded data contain information in line with two different states (before lathing and after lathing). The wheels can be considered as potentially unhealthy (defective) before lathing and as healthy after lathing. To verify the effectiveness of theproposed real-time defect detection methodology, the strain monitoring data obtained from the bogies before and afterThe train’s dynamic responses may be influenced by different subgrade conditions of the railroad, such as ground, tunnel,\nand bridge. To eliminate the effects of different railroad conditions, the strain data recorded from the same railroad sectionbefore and after lathing, are used in each scenario. In addition, the passenger loads in different trips are deemed statistically identical and the speed of train is assumed to be constant as in normal operation. Without loss of generality, the monitoring\ndata respectively obtained from two typical railroad sections (1st and 14th) in the trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou are chosen to illustrate the proposed real-time defect detection methodology, which are from the strain gauge (MS3-7) deployed at the For the sake of brevity, the monitoring data collected from the 1st railroad section are denoted as Case 1, while those from the 14th railroad section are denoted as Case 2. Firstly, the measured strain is converted to stress for the subsequent stress\nrange calculation. For the strain gauges mounted on the steel surface, the conversion of the measured strain to stress is made by rs ¼ Ee, where E is the elasticity modulus of steel and e is the strain after eliminating the effect of varying temperatures.where em is the measured strain, T m is the measured temperature in the vicinity of the strain sensor, T 0 is the temperature at\nthe installation, and a1 is a constant coefficient. In our case, the original temperature is 4, i.e., T 0 ¼ 4. The results of temperature compensation are demonstrated in Fig. 5. It is obvious that the trend in strain responses caused by temperature\nAfterwards, the stress ranges are extracted from the monitoring-derived stress data by the application of the rainflow\ncounting algorithm. From each stress cycle, the stress range Sa is obtained by calculating the difference between the maximum stress rmax and the minimum stress rmin measured in that stress cycle, i.e., Sa ¼ rmax rmin. More details on the stress ranges extraction are given in . The stress ranges with amplitudes lower than 1 MPa need to be culled because the majority are caused by noise. To decrease the uncertainty arising from the measurement facilities, the average stress ranges for\nevery ten minutes are used as the target quantities. Due to the different lengths of the two selected railroad sections (1st and 14th), the traveling time of the train in each section is also different. This results in different data lengths. The data\nlengths of the average stress ranges in Case 1 and Case 2 are 110 and 90, respectively. Figs. and 7 show the original measured strain responses before and after lathing in Case 1 and Case 2, respectively.Following the implementation procedures mentioned before, the defect detection results for Case 1 are demonstrated in\nFigs. and 9. Fig. 8(a) shows the average stress range (red point) together with 1-step ahead prediction (blue solid line) and\nthe corresponding 90% prediction interval (grey shadow). It is observed that, although some observations at the time interval t 2 fall outside the 90% prediction interval, only the Bayes factor at time t ¼ 55 exceeds the established threshold of Hmin ¼ 10 as shown in Fig. 9(a). It is thus judged as an outlier (marked as h). The reason is that because when applying the proposed approach, the shift parameter is set as h ¼ 1:645rt, resulting in the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt while the other\nfour observations are still within the uncertainty limit. On the other hand, Fig. 9(b)–(c) shows the results of the maximum cumulative Bayes factor and the corresponding run length for change detection. It is seen that the maximum cumulative\nBayes factor values at time instants t ¼ 56; 57 and 58 are larger than the threshold of Lmin ¼ 10, while merely the run length at instant t ¼ 58 surpasses the threshold of lmin ¼ 4. Apparently, this observation at time t ¼ 58 fulfills the conditions of change-point detection causing an alarm to be issued (i.e., TON ¼ 58). The identified real occurrence time of change-point is t ¼ 55 (i.e., TOC ¼ 58 4 þ 1 ¼ 55), which coincides well with the actual time point of lathing the wheels. In accordance\nwith the real-time identification of change-point occurrence, the prediction model is refined by altering the guessed mean\nvalue at TOC, as shown in Fig. 8(b). The predictions near TOC in the refined model obviously agree well with the actual observations, thus offering a better prediction performance than that of the original model.\nThe results of defect detection by means of Bayesian hypothesis testing are illustrated in Fig. 9(d). The discrimination between ‘‘healthy” and ‘‘defective” is quantified by the logarithm value of Bayes factor. It is seen from Fig. 9(d) that the vast\nmajority of logarithm values of Bayes factor before TOC are nearly zero and below the threshold level (dotted red line), which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘healthy state” (no defect). This is consistent with the actual health condition and thus validatesthe capability of the Bayesian hypothesis testing. On the contrary, all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than 2, meaning that the corresponding Bayes factor values exceed 100. According to the classification of Bayes factor stipulated in Sub-section 3.1, this result (H > 100) favors the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity is classified as ‘‘decisive”. Indeed, wheels immediately before being sent to depot for lathing were in the state of ‘heavily defective’.\nMaking use of Eq. (21), the probabilities of damage after TOC are obtained as 100%, that is, the wheels are identified as defective with a very high confidence.\nThe defect detection results for Case 2 are similar to Case 1, and are illustrated in Figs. and 11. As seen in Fig. 11(a)–(c)\nno outlier exists throughout the whole period, but a change-point is identified, of which the time of notification is t ¼ 44 (i.e.,\nTON ¼ 44) and the real time of occurrence is t ¼ 41 (i.e., TOC ¼ 44 4 þ 1 ¼ 41). The result matches well with the actual time point when wheel lathing is inflicted. For the predictions near the change-point, the modified prediction model\n(Fig. 10(b)) offers a better performance than the original model (Fig. 10(a)). As illustrated in Fig. 11(d), all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than the threshold (dotted red line), whereas the values before TOC are within thethreshold line. The values of Bayes factor after TOC are obtained to be higher than 100 (H > 100) and the corresponding probabilities of damage are approximately 100%, which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity\nApart from the accuracy of the proposed approach, the computational efficiency is also of concern. The algorithmic implementation is performed on a Lenovo ThinkCentre M720t desktop (Lenovo, Beijing, China) with Dual Intel Core i7-8700 processor (Intel, California, USA) and 24 GB of memory. The computation times consumed in Case 1 and Case 2 are 4.0109 s and\n3.7704 s respectively. In this sense, it realizes the detection of wheel defects in real time.5. ConclusionsA novel methodology for real-time defect detection of high-speed train wheels using Bayesian forecasting and dynamic linear model (DLM) has been developed and validated in this study. First, the DLM is formulated to approximate the actual\nframework. Afterwards, three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) are elicited for outlier detection and change-point detection. After the change-point has been confirmed, damage assessment is executed by the Bayesian hypothesis testing of the sequential observations before and after the change-point. Due to accommodating the dynamic evolution process and the statistical nature of the method, the proposed approach not only possesses the ability of real-time damage detection, but also enables damage quantification (through classifying the range of Bayes factor) and uncertainty assessment (through calculating the probability of damage). The methodology is illustrated by using the onlinelathing). In the two cases addressed, wheel defects are successfully identified, hence validating the effectiveness of the developed method. The quantitative results about the damage extent and confidence would provide useful information helping to\nmake cost-effective, risk-based decisions with the aim of maintaining the operation safety of high-speed rail.\nDespite the proposed methodology being developed for wheel defect detection of high-speed trains, it can also be applied to low-speed passenger and freight trains as well as extended to SHM for a wide variety of civil infrastructure (e.g., bridges,\nbuildings and tunnels) when vibration signals are available via monitoring. In this study, the second-order polynomial DLM\nis employed to model the stress ranges, which only considers the change of stress range level and trend. However, most longterm SHM data, especially long-term strain monitoring data, are generally contaminated by trend, seasonal (cyclical) and\nregression effects, which require a more complex model. The Bayesian DLM enables the modeling of time-dependent responses of a structure by integrating appropriate components, for instance, the response with cyclical characteristics\ncan be depicted by embedding a seasonal (cyclical) component. Thus, in accordance with the nature of monitoring data,\nan appropriate Bayesian DLM enabling to describe time series data of different features, can be formulated for damage detection of a variety of structures subject to different operational/environmental conditions.Administrative Region, China (Project No. PolyU 152024/17E).

Rail accidents were occasionally caused by failures such as severe defects or fatigue of railway components. To maintain a good service quality and operation safety, it is paramount to develop\nonline monitoring techniques that not only quickly recognize faults of mission-critical HSR components but also can anticipate of long-term mechanisms and gradual deterioration in performance.\nWheelsets in a high-speed train are physically connected with and controlled by the bogie system which corrects alignment for stable running and reduces the vibration caused by wheel-rail interaction . However, the wheel performance\nprogressively deteriorates in different mechanisms (e.g., wheel flat and wheel polygonization) during the routine operation of a high-speed train . Wheel performance deterioration increases stresses experienced by the bogie system. In addition,\nthe increased stress within bogie frames caused by wheel quality deterioration can be unexpectedly large, thus posing a serious threat to the operation safety of concerned trains. According to the statistics of train accidents caused by failure in\nmechanical components during 2004 to 2007 in the United States, the wheelsets faults are the most cause with a rate of\n44.7% . Therefore, the railway managers are keen to keep wheels in an adequate condition and detect potential failure\nas soon as possible. For railway wheels, there are three different ways of estimating the conditions: physical modeling, statistical modeling and condition monitoring . However, the first two ways are not applicable to in-service\nwheel condition assessment, and in contrast, the third way is most feasible for wheel condition estimation. The monitoring approaches available to wheel defect detection can be divided into in-workshop inspection and in-service detection . The\nlatter provides the real-time data required for maintenance planning, while the former is normally carried out at workshops at fixed intervals. The commonly used in-workshop methods for wheel defect inspection include the ultrasonic techniques, infrared camera and magnetic methods . In-service monitoring approaches can be categorized as on-board and wayside methods. The on-board methods implement sensors on the train and continuously obtain comprehensive data from\nthe system. The methods of this category include magnetic technique , ultrasonic technique , acoustic technique, and vibration technique . On the other hand, wayside methods attempt to detect the wheel or vehicle performance\nby installing sensors on the rail or its surrounding areas. Such indirect measurements give rise to limited information of the wheel condition while they can monitor all train wheels going by with using only one or a few sensors. According to the type\nof sensors used, wayside detection approaches include strain sensing technology , fiber optic sensing technology ,\nultrasonic technique , vibration technique , acoustic emission , lasers and high-speed cameras . However,\nthe study on data interpretation techniques enabling the extraction of defect-sensitive features is far from sufficient.\nBayesian dynamic linear model (DLM) is an elegant system approach to handling time series data from a Bayesian perspective, which originates from the field of applied statistics and is extensively used in other fields such as economics\nand engineering [25–30]. The Bayesian DLM treats the time series as the output of a dynamic system perturbed by random disturbances. It is suitable for modeling both univariate and multivariate time series, and also for representing the structural changes, non-stationarity and irregular patterns . Unlike the classical time series method which assumes a fixed relationship between the dependent variables (response variables) and the independent variables (regressors), the DLM considers\nthe relationship changes over time and is able to directly capture time series data features, such as trend, seasonality,\nand regression effects. Moreover, the DLM allows for descriptions of temporary or permanent shifts in time series parameters that occur abruptly, which are necessary for outlier and damage detection in structural health monitoring (SHM) paradigms. Recently, Goulet and his collaborator adopted the Bayesian DLM theory in SHM to model the time-dependent\nresponses of structures by breaking them into subcomponents. In the perspective of real-time damage detection, only few studies are available. The first attempt was conducted by Lipowsky et al. with the development of a Bayesian DLM-based\nreal-time detection algorithm to evaluate the performance of a gas turbine using simulated data. Later on, Wang et al.\nand Zhang et al. adopted the above algorithm for detecting high-speed train defects by using real-world monitoring\ndata. In the previous studies, however, the real-time detection algorithm devised possesses only outlier identification and\nchange detection abilities, without the function of damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.context of Bayesian DLM, which incorporates logics for prognosis, potential outlier detection, identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and damage extent and uncertainty quantification. The Bayesian DLM is considered as a tool\nfor time series analysis, while Bayesian forecasting is executed to enable the calculation of one-step ahead forecast distribution. The change-point detection is performed by checking the current observation against the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM for current instant) as well as against an alternative model of which the mean value\nis shifted by a prescribed offset. The detection rule is that if the alternative model better fits the actual observation, a potential change is signaled. To further determine whether such an observation is only an outlier or the beginning of an actual\nchange (change-point), a specific logic is developed by introducing the Bayes factor and the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.\nThe main contributions of this study are the provision of: (i) a formula which not only enables the modeling of actual framework; (ii) three metrics (i.e., the Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) to allow for outlier\nand change-point detection in real-time manner; and (iii) an efficient way for damage extent assessment and uncertainty\nquantification. The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the Bayesian DLM theory and an elaboration of the Bayesian forecasting philosophy. Section 3 presents the defect detection methodology that incorporates logics for\noutlier detection, change-point identification, and damage assessment. In Section 4, two case studies making use of timeseries strain data acquired by fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors affixed on the bogies of an in-service high-speed train are offered to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the proposed methodology. Finally, conclusions are drawn in2. Bayesian DLM and forecastingThe Bayesian DLM is a kind of process-based Bayesian prediction model which provides a flexible way to intuitively capture how processes evolve over time. It consists of two basic equations: an observation (measurement) equation and a system (evolution) equation . The observation (measurement) equation describes the relationship between the observed\nrandom vectors with mean zero and unknown covariance matrices V t and W t. The DLM defined above amounts to treating ht\nrange level at time t, and at represents the stress range change between time t 1 and t. v t is the zero-mean Gaussian random variable representing the error of measurement at moment t. x1t and x2t are both zero-mean Gaussian random variables representing the evolution of DLM from time t 1 to t. In association with the form of DLM in Equation (1), we haveThe Bayesian forecasting philosophy is based on the description of an observed process using its probability density function (PDF). As implied by the name, the Bayesian forecasting approach commences from Bayes’ theorem, hence enabling the calculation of conditional probabilities. The details of using DLM for the recursive one-step ahead forecasting of the (posterior) distribution of monitoring-derived stress ranges under the Bayesian framework are presented as follows\nNote that in Step 4, Atþ1 is the adaptive coefficient which can be viewed as the information tuner. It scales the correction term according to the relative variances of the prior and likelihood, as measured by Rtþ1=Q tþ1 and regressor value Ftþ1. etþ1 is\nthe one-step forward forecast error, the difference between the observed value ytþ1 and its expectation f tþ1. More details\nabout the recursive one-step ahead forecast method can be found in .3. Defect detection methodologyThe proposed defect detection methodology contains three logical processes: outlier detection, change-point detection,\nand damage assessment. By comparing the real-time measurement with the predicted values, the named outlier detection and change-point detection are devised to determine whether the measurement is a single outlier or the first observation of a remarkable change, the former being executed by calculating the Bayes factor, while the latter being based on the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once a change-point is affirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for further damagePotential outlier detection is the first step in the process of the proposed defect detection approach, accomplished by the Bayes factor calculation. Bayes factor is advocated because of its straightforward and natural interpretation of evidence afforded by data. At every time step t, the Bayesian DLM can yield a PDF for the next measurement, labeled as M0. Meanwhile, an artificial alternative model labeled as M1 is defined by shifting the mean of M0 by +h. The underlying idea of outlier\ndetection is to check the current observation against both M0 and M1. For each time step t, the Bayes factor is the ratio of thewhere yt is the measurement at time t and Dt1 refers to the history information up to time t 1. In the case of Gaussianwhere h is the shift value; yt is the observation value; f t and rt are the mean and standard deviation of the forecasting distribution for observation at time t. A Bayes factor H ¼ 1 indicates that the probability of the observation derived from model M1 is identical to the probability of that derived from Model M0. For better quantitative comparison between any two models, Jeffreys suggested interpreting the Bayes factor as a scale of evidence and provided descriptive statements although\nthe partitions are somewhat arbitrary. According to his suggestion, a Bayes factor can be divided into several intervals for assessing the significance of discrimination: 1 < H < 3 is ‘barely worth mentioning’, 3 < H < 10 is ‘substantial’,\n10 < H < 30 is ‘strong’, 30 < H < 100 is ‘very strong’, and H > 100 is ‘decisive’. In this study, Hmin ¼ 10 is set as a threshold\nAfter the confirmation of Hmin and h, an uncertainty limit (ucl) can be procured by the following equationFor instance, when the confidence level a and threshold of Bayes factor Hmin are set as 90% and 10 respectively, the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt. Thus, an observation is diagnosed as an outlier if its deviation from the mean value of M0 is larger\nWith the Bayes factor defined in Equation (9), only outliers with a positive deviation can be detected. To enable the outliers with negative deviation to be detected as well, a second Bayes factor is defined asIn the automatic monitoring process, both the Bayes factors H1;t and H2;t should be examined in parallel to enable thebehavior, rather than judgments based on long past performances. Change-point is an abrupt variation in time series data,\nrepresenting a transition that occurs between states. Change-point detection aims to detect abrupt change in the generative\nprocess of sequential data. It is assumed that a sequence of observations y1; ; yT could be divided into several nonoverlapping partitions, e.g. dataset j 1, dataset j, and dataset j + 1 as shown in Fig. 2. The delineations between partitions\nare known as change-points (e.g. TOC j 1 and TOC j); the goal of change-point detection is the determination of where the\nboundary of two adjacent partitions is located in a sequence of observations. Change-point detection approaches can be classified into offline and online methods. The former needs to observe the whole sequential observations before aiming to make\ninference on the generative process of the sequence [37–40], wheras the latter aims to update the inference at each time step\nwith the newly acquired measurements from the sequence [41–43]. In particular, the Bayesian online change-point detection methods are based on computing the probability distribution of the run length.differentiate between the single-point outlier and the beginning of a continual change. To overcome this problem, cumulative Bayes factor (local Bayes factors) is recommended to detect change-point(s) in the sequence of observations, by definingwhere lmax is the maximum number of Bayes factors taken into account. Unlike Bayes factor with implicitly no historical influence in the judgement, the consecutive Bayes factors collect evidence of change over a series of observation (from time\net al. . Akin to the Bayes factor threshold for outlier detection, the threshold of maximal cumulative Bayes factors is set as Lmin ¼ 10. If the conditions Lt > Lmin and lt > lmin occur simultaneously, an alarm of change is immediately issued at time t\n(time of notification, TON). The real time of occurrence (TOC) is (t lt þ 1), that is, TOC =t lt þ 1.Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is performed to assess damage extent and quantify the\nassociated uncertainty. The proposed approach directly quantifies the likelihoods of two scenarios (e.g., the sequential observations before and after the change-point), that is, ‘‘no fault” and ‘‘fault”, and the yielded results are easy to interpret. An\nadditional merit of the proposed approach is its ability to quantify the uncertainty in damage detection. Assume that the observed sequential data can be divided into two non-overlapping partitions, the first of which is regarded as healthy\nof the observations. Thus, the damage detection problem becomes the test of H0 : l ¼ l0 versus H1 : l–l0 with\nWith the above, damage detection can be achieved by means of Bayes factor which is defined as the ratio of the probability of observations given the alternate hypothesis to the probability of observations given the null hypothesiswhere D ¼ yf 1; ; yng refers to the observed data. It is proven to bewhere refers to the mean of the observed data fy1; ; yng. If no prior information is available, the initial mean and variance can be set as q ¼ l0 and s ¼ r 0 [][. The two assumptions take the prior mean and variance in the alternative hypothesis as]where z ¼ pfn **f** i ffi l0 0 [ At each time step (i.e.,][ n][=1), the Bayes factor][ B][ is larger for the larger values of][ z][j j][, which is reasonable]and easy to interpret. The logarithm of the Bayes factor, for convenience of comparison among a larger of values, is derived asIf the Bayes factor B10 is larger than 1, the implication is that the observed data provide evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis H1 (i.e., the structure is damaged). Otherwise, the observed data are judged to support the null hypothesis H0 (i.e.,\nthe structure is healthy). As with the previous threshold, B10 10 is set as a threshold for damage indication.\nIntegrating together the outlier detection, change-point detection and damage assessment, the implementation procedures of the proposed methodology are shown in Fig. 3. Beginning at time t, the single Bayes factor is firstly evaluated to\njudge whether yt is an outlier. If not, the maximum cumulative Bayes factor Lt and run length lt for change-point detection are calculated. Once a change-point is detected, the intervention is carried out by resetting the time to the time of occurrence\n(i.e., TOC = t lt þ 1) and by adjusting the mean value of M0 to the observation yt (i.e., f t ¼ yt), and the subsequent analysis\nwill then be started at TOC. Meanwhile, Bayesian hypothesis testing is executed for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification from the current TOC to the next TOC.4. Application to in-service monitoring data of high-speed trainAn onboard monitoring system has been designed and implemented on an in-service high-speed passenger train running on the Lanzhou-Urumqi High-Speed Railway (LUHSR) in China . As shown in Fig. 4, the monitoring system is composed\nof a total of 52 FBG strain sensors, 4 FBG temperature sensors, 11 accelerometers (tri-axial) and 1 noise sensor deployed on both motor and trailer bogies. Also, one tri-axial FBG accelerometer, one video camera and two GPS sensors are installed inside a train carriage. As the present work is focused on the real-time detection of potentially defective wheels by using strain monitoring data from bogies, only the deployment of strain sensors is concerned. The strain sensors are mounted\non 4 measurement zones of the bogies: (i) the zone with the action of high loads; (ii) the stress transmission zone; (iii)\nthe zone with high responses predicted by finite element analysis; and (iv) welded joints. FBG strain (and temperature) sensors are deployed and attached to the surface of the train bogie with industrial glue and tapes, and connected to the interrogator (data logger) with laptop inside the train carriage through optical fiber cables.\nThe data utilized in this study were obtained from a monitoring schedule spanning 18 days as shown in Table 1. The total length of the LUHSR between Lanzhou and Urumqi is 1777 km. In the trip from Lanzhou to Urumqi, the high-speed train\nstops by 14 stations and travels cross 13 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 13th); in trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou, the high-speed train stops by 15 stations and travels cross 14 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 14th). During the monitoring\nperiod, the train operated at its normal speed around 200–250 km/h. The sampling rate for all the sensors was set at 5000\nSince the train wheels were lathed (lathing is a process to make wheels perfectly rounded) during the monitoring period,\nthe recorded data contain information in line with two different states (before lathing and after lathing). The wheels can be considered as potentially unhealthy (defective) before lathing and as healthy after lathing. To verify the effectiveness of theproposed real-time defect detection methodology, the strain monitoring data obtained from the bogies before and afterThe train’s dynamic responses may be influenced by different subgrade conditions of the railroad, such as ground, tunnel,\nand bridge. To eliminate the effects of different railroad conditions, the strain data recorded from the same railroad sectionbefore and after lathing, are used in each scenario. In addition, the passenger loads in different trips are deemed statistically identical and the speed of train is assumed to be constant as in normal operation. Without loss of generality, the monitoring\ndata respectively obtained from two typical railroad sections (1st and 14th) in the trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou are chosen to illustrate the proposed real-time defect detection methodology, which are from the strain gauge (MS3-7) deployed at the For the sake of brevity, the monitoring data collected from the 1st railroad section are denoted as Case 1, while those from the 14th railroad section are denoted as Case 2. Firstly, the measured strain is converted to stress for the subsequent stress\nrange calculation. For the strain gauges mounted on the steel surface, the conversion of the measured strain to stress is made by rs ¼ Ee, where E is the elasticity modulus of steel and e is the strain after eliminating the effect of varying temperatures.where em is the measured strain, T m is the measured temperature in the vicinity of the strain sensor, T 0 is the temperature at\nthe installation, and a1 is a constant coefficient. In our case, the original temperature is 4, i.e., T 0 ¼ 4. The results of temperature compensation are demonstrated in Fig. 5. It is obvious that the trend in strain responses caused by temperature\nAfterwards, the stress ranges are extracted from the monitoring-derived stress data by the application of the rainflow\ncounting algorithm. From each stress cycle, the stress range Sa is obtained by calculating the difference between the maximum stress rmax and the minimum stress rmin measured in that stress cycle, i.e., Sa ¼ rmax rmin. More details on the stress ranges extraction are given in . The stress ranges with amplitudes lower than 1 MPa need to be culled because the majority are caused by noise. To decrease the uncertainty arising from the measurement facilities, the average stress ranges for\nevery ten minutes are used as the target quantities. Due to the different lengths of the two selected railroad sections (1st and 14th), the traveling time of the train in each section is also different. This results in different data lengths. The data\nlengths of the average stress ranges in Case 1 and Case 2 are 110 and 90, respectively. Figs. and 7 show the original measured strain responses before and after lathing in Case 1 and Case 2, respectively.Following the implementation procedures mentioned before, the defect detection results for Case 1 are demonstrated in\nFigs. and 9. Fig. 8(a) shows the average stress range (red point) together with 1-step ahead prediction (blue solid line) and\nthe corresponding 90% prediction interval (grey shadow). It is observed that, although some observations at the time interval t 2 fall outside the 90% prediction interval, only the Bayes factor at time t ¼ 55 exceeds the established threshold of Hmin ¼ 10 as shown in Fig. 9(a). It is thus judged as an outlier (marked as h). The reason is that because when applying the proposed approach, the shift parameter is set as h ¼ 1:645rt, resulting in the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt while the other\nfour observations are still within the uncertainty limit. On the other hand, Fig. 9(b)–(c) shows the results of the maximum cumulative Bayes factor and the corresponding run length for change detection. It is seen that the maximum cumulative\nBayes factor values at time instants t ¼ 56; 57 and 58 are larger than the threshold of Lmin ¼ 10, while merely the run length at instant t ¼ 58 surpasses the threshold of lmin ¼ 4. Apparently, this observation at time t ¼ 58 fulfills the conditions of change-point detection causing an alarm to be issued (i.e., TON ¼ 58). The identified real occurrence time of change-point is t ¼ 55 (i.e., TOC ¼ 58 4 þ 1 ¼ 55), which coincides well with the actual time point of lathing the wheels. In accordance\nwith the real-time identification of change-point occurrence, the prediction model is refined by altering the guessed mean\nvalue at TOC, as shown in Fig. 8(b). The predictions near TOC in the refined model obviously agree well with the actual observations, thus offering a better prediction performance than that of the original model.\nThe results of defect detection by means of Bayesian hypothesis testing are illustrated in Fig. 9(d). The discrimination between ‘‘healthy” and ‘‘defective” is quantified by the logarithm value of Bayes factor. It is seen from Fig. 9(d) that the vast\nmajority of logarithm values of Bayes factor before TOC are nearly zero and below the threshold level (dotted red line), which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘healthy state” (no defect). This is consistent with the actual health condition and thus validatesthe capability of the Bayesian hypothesis testing. On the contrary, all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than 2, meaning that the corresponding Bayes factor values exceed 100. According to the classification of Bayes factor stipulated in Sub-section 3.1, this result (H > 100) favors the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity is classified as ‘‘decisive”. Indeed, wheels immediately before being sent to depot for lathing were in the state of ‘heavily defective’.\nMaking use of Eq. (21), the probabilities of damage after TOC are obtained as 100%, that is, the wheels are identified as defective with a very high confidence.\nThe defect detection results for Case 2 are similar to Case 1, and are illustrated in Figs. and 11. As seen in Fig. 11(a)–(c)\nno outlier exists throughout the whole period, but a change-point is identified, of which the time of notification is t ¼ 44 (i.e.,\nTON ¼ 44) and the real time of occurrence is t ¼ 41 (i.e., TOC ¼ 44 4 þ 1 ¼ 41). The result matches well with the actual time point when wheel lathing is inflicted. For the predictions near the change-point, the modified prediction model\n(Fig. 10(b)) offers a better performance than the original model (Fig. 10(a)). As illustrated in Fig. 11(d), all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than the threshold (dotted red line), whereas the values before TOC are within thethreshold line. The values of Bayes factor after TOC are obtained to be higher than 100 (H > 100) and the corresponding probabilities of damage are approximately 100%, which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity\nApart from the accuracy of the proposed approach, the computational efficiency is also of concern. The algorithmic implementation is performed on a Lenovo ThinkCentre M720t desktop (Lenovo, Beijing, China) with Dual Intel Core i7-8700 processor (Intel, California, USA) and 24 GB of memory. The computation times consumed in Case 1 and Case 2 are 4.0109 s and\n3.7704 s respectively. In this sense, it realizes the detection of wheel defects in real time.5. ConclusionsA novel methodology for real-time defect detection of high-speed train wheels using Bayesian forecasting and dynamic linear model (DLM) has been developed and validated in this study. First, the DLM is formulated to approximate the actual\nframework. Afterwards, three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) are elicited for outlier detection and change-point detection. After the change-point has been confirmed, damage assessment is executed by the Bayesian hypothesis testing of the sequential observations before and after the change-point. Due to accommodating the dynamic evolution process and the statistical nature of the method, the proposed approach not only possesses the ability of real-time damage detection, but also enables damage quantification (through classifying the range of Bayes factor) and uncertainty assessment (through calculating the probability of damage). The methodology is illustrated by using the onlinelathing). In the two cases addressed, wheel defects are successfully identified, hence validating the effectiveness of the developed method. The quantitative results about the damage extent and confidence would provide useful information helping to\nmake cost-effective, risk-based decisions with the aim of maintaining the operation safety of high-speed rail.\nDespite the proposed methodology being developed for wheel defect detection of high-speed trains, it can also be applied to low-speed passenger and freight trains as well as extended to SHM for a wide variety of civil infrastructure (e.g., bridges,\nbuildings and tunnels) when vibration signals are available via monitoring. In this study, the second-order polynomial DLM\nis employed to model the stress ranges, which only considers the change of stress range level and trend. However, most longterm SHM data, especially long-term strain monitoring data, are generally contaminated by trend, seasonal (cyclical) and\nregression effects, which require a more complex model. The Bayesian DLM enables the modeling of time-dependent responses of a structure by integrating appropriate components, for instance, the response with cyclical characteristics\ncan be depicted by embedding a seasonal (cyclical) component. Thus, in accordance with the nature of monitoring data,\nan appropriate Bayesian DLM enabling to describe time series data of different features, can be formulated for damage detection of a variety of structures subject to different operational/environmental conditions.Administrative Region, China (Project No. PolyU 152024/17E).

Rail accidents were occasionally caused by failures such as severe defects or fatigue of railway components. To maintain a good service quality and operation safety, it is paramount to develop\nonline monitoring techniques that not only quickly recognize faults of mission-critical HSR components but also can anticipate of long-term mechanisms and gradual deterioration in performance.\nWheelsets in a high-speed train are physically connected with and controlled by the bogie system which corrects alignment for stable running and reduces the vibration caused by wheel-rail interaction . However, the wheel performance\nprogressively deteriorates in different mechanisms (e.g., wheel flat and wheel polygonization) during the routine operation of a high-speed train . Wheel performance deterioration increases stresses experienced by the bogie system. In addition,\nthe increased stress within bogie frames caused by wheel quality deterioration can be unexpectedly large, thus posing a serious threat to the operation safety of concerned trains. According to the statistics of train accidents caused by failure in\nmechanical components during 2004 to 2007 in the United States, the wheelsets faults are the most cause with a rate of\n44.7% . Therefore, the railway managers are keen to keep wheels in an adequate condition and detect potential failure\nas soon as possible. For railway wheels, there are three different ways of estimating the conditions: physical modeling, statistical modeling and condition monitoring . However, the first two ways are not applicable to in-service\nwheel condition assessment, and in contrast, the third way is most feasible for wheel condition estimation. The monitoring approaches available to wheel defect detection can be divided into in-workshop inspection and in-service detection . The\nlatter provides the real-time data required for maintenance planning, while the former is normally carried out at workshops at fixed intervals. The commonly used in-workshop methods for wheel defect inspection include the ultrasonic techniques, infrared camera and magnetic methods . In-service monitoring approaches can be categorized as on-board and wayside methods. The on-board methods implement sensors on the train and continuously obtain comprehensive data from\nthe system. The methods of this category include magnetic technique , ultrasonic technique , acoustic technique, and vibration technique . On the other hand, wayside methods attempt to detect the wheel or vehicle performance\nby installing sensors on the rail or its surrounding areas. Such indirect measurements give rise to limited information of the wheel condition while they can monitor all train wheels going by with using only one or a few sensors. According to the type\nof sensors used, wayside detection approaches include strain sensing technology , fiber optic sensing technology ,\nultrasonic technique , vibration technique , acoustic emission , lasers and high-speed cameras . However,\nthe study on data interpretation techniques enabling the extraction of defect-sensitive features is far from sufficient.\nBayesian dynamic linear model (DLM) is an elegant system approach to handling time series data from a Bayesian perspective, which originates from the field of applied statistics and is extensively used in other fields such as economics\nand engineering [25–30]. The Bayesian DLM treats the time series as the output of a dynamic system perturbed by random disturbances. It is suitable for modeling both univariate and multivariate time series, and also for representing the structural changes, non-stationarity and irregular patterns . Unlike the classical time series method which assumes a fixed relationship between the dependent variables (response variables) and the independent variables (regressors), the DLM considers\nthe relationship changes over time and is able to directly capture time series data features, such as trend, seasonality,\nand regression effects. Moreover, the DLM allows for descriptions of temporary or permanent shifts in time series parameters that occur abruptly, which are necessary for outlier and damage detection in structural health monitoring (SHM) paradigms. Recently, Goulet and his collaborator adopted the Bayesian DLM theory in SHM to model the time-dependent\nresponses of structures by breaking them into subcomponents. In the perspective of real-time damage detection, only few studies are available. The first attempt was conducted by Lipowsky et al. with the development of a Bayesian DLM-based\nreal-time detection algorithm to evaluate the performance of a gas turbine using simulated data. Later on, Wang et al.\nand Zhang et al. adopted the above algorithm for detecting high-speed train defects by using real-world monitoring\ndata. In the previous studies, however, the real-time detection algorithm devised possesses only outlier identification and\nchange detection abilities, without the function of damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.context of Bayesian DLM, which incorporates logics for prognosis, potential outlier detection, identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and damage extent and uncertainty quantification. The Bayesian DLM is considered as a tool\nfor time series analysis, while Bayesian forecasting is executed to enable the calculation of one-step ahead forecast distribution. The change-point detection is performed by checking the current observation against the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM for current instant) as well as against an alternative model of which the mean value\nis shifted by a prescribed offset. The detection rule is that if the alternative model better fits the actual observation, a potential change is signaled. To further determine whether such an observation is only an outlier or the beginning of an actual\nchange (change-point), a specific logic is developed by introducing the Bayes factor and the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.\nThe main contributions of this study are the provision of: (i) a formula which not only enables the modeling of actual framework; (ii) three metrics (i.e., the Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) to allow for outlier\nand change-point detection in real-time manner; and (iii) an efficient way for damage extent assessment and uncertainty\nquantification. The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the Bayesian DLM theory and an elaboration of the Bayesian forecasting philosophy. Section 3 presents the defect detection methodology that incorporates logics for\noutlier detection, change-point identification, and damage assessment. In Section 4, two case studies making use of timeseries strain data acquired by fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors affixed on the bogies of an in-service high-speed train are offered to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the proposed methodology. Finally, conclusions are drawn in2. Bayesian DLM and forecastingThe Bayesian DLM is a kind of process-based Bayesian prediction model which provides a flexible way to intuitively capture how processes evolve over time. It consists of two basic equations: an observation (measurement) equation and a system (evolution) equation . The observation (measurement) equation describes the relationship between the observed\nrandom vectors with mean zero and unknown covariance matrices V t and W t. The DLM defined above amounts to treating ht\nrange level at time t, and at represents the stress range change between time t 1 and t. v t is the zero-mean Gaussian random variable representing the error of measurement at moment t. x1t and x2t are both zero-mean Gaussian random variables representing the evolution of DLM from time t 1 to t. In association with the form of DLM in Equation (1), we haveThe Bayesian forecasting philosophy is based on the description of an observed process using its probability density function (PDF). As implied by the name, the Bayesian forecasting approach commences from Bayes’ theorem, hence enabling the calculation of conditional probabilities. The details of using DLM for the recursive one-step ahead forecasting of the (posterior) distribution of monitoring-derived stress ranges under the Bayesian framework are presented as follows\nNote that in Step 4, Atþ1 is the adaptive coefficient which can be viewed as the information tuner. It scales the correction term according to the relative variances of the prior and likelihood, as measured by Rtþ1=Q tþ1 and regressor value Ftþ1. etþ1 is\nthe one-step forward forecast error, the difference between the observed value ytþ1 and its expectation f tþ1. More details\nabout the recursive one-step ahead forecast method can be found in .3. Defect detection methodologyThe proposed defect detection methodology contains three logical processes: outlier detection, change-point detection,\nand damage assessment. By comparing the real-time measurement with the predicted values, the named outlier detection and change-point detection are devised to determine whether the measurement is a single outlier or the first observation of a remarkable change, the former being executed by calculating the Bayes factor, while the latter being based on the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once a change-point is affirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for further damagePotential outlier detection is the first step in the process of the proposed defect detection approach, accomplished by the Bayes factor calculation. Bayes factor is advocated because of its straightforward and natural interpretation of evidence afforded by data. At every time step t, the Bayesian DLM can yield a PDF for the next measurement, labeled as M0. Meanwhile, an artificial alternative model labeled as M1 is defined by shifting the mean of M0 by +h. The underlying idea of outlier\ndetection is to check the current observation against both M0 and M1. For each time step t, the Bayes factor is the ratio of thewhere yt is the measurement at time t and Dt1 refers to the history information up to time t 1. In the case of Gaussianwhere h is the shift value; yt is the observation value; f t and rt are the mean and standard deviation of the forecasting distribution for observation at time t. A Bayes factor H ¼ 1 indicates that the probability of the observation derived from model M1 is identical to the probability of that derived from Model M0. For better quantitative comparison between any two models, Jeffreys suggested interpreting the Bayes factor as a scale of evidence and provided descriptive statements although\nthe partitions are somewhat arbitrary. According to his suggestion, a Bayes factor can be divided into several intervals for assessing the significance of discrimination: 1 < H < 3 is ‘barely worth mentioning’, 3 < H < 10 is ‘substantial’,\n10 < H < 30 is ‘strong’, 30 < H < 100 is ‘very strong’, and H > 100 is ‘decisive’. In this study, Hmin ¼ 10 is set as a threshold\nAfter the confirmation of Hmin and h, an uncertainty limit (ucl) can be procured by the following equationFor instance, when the confidence level a and threshold of Bayes factor Hmin are set as 90% and 10 respectively, the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt. Thus, an observation is diagnosed as an outlier if its deviation from the mean value of M0 is larger\nWith the Bayes factor defined in Equation (9), only outliers with a positive deviation can be detected. To enable the outliers with negative deviation to be detected as well, a second Bayes factor is defined asIn the automatic monitoring process, both the Bayes factors H1;t and H2;t should be examined in parallel to enable thebehavior, rather than judgments based on long past performances. Change-point is an abrupt variation in time series data,\nrepresenting a transition that occurs between states. Change-point detection aims to detect abrupt change in the generative\nprocess of sequential data. It is assumed that a sequence of observations y1; ; yT could be divided into several nonoverlapping partitions, e.g. dataset j 1, dataset j, and dataset j + 1 as shown in Fig. 2. The delineations between partitions\nare known as change-points (e.g. TOC j 1 and TOC j); the goal of change-point detection is the determination of where the\nboundary of two adjacent partitions is located in a sequence of observations. Change-point detection approaches can be classified into offline and online methods. The former needs to observe the whole sequential observations before aiming to make\ninference on the generative process of the sequence [37–40], wheras the latter aims to update the inference at each time step\nwith the newly acquired measurements from the sequence [41–43]. In particular, the Bayesian online change-point detection methods are based on computing the probability distribution of the run length.differentiate between the single-point outlier and the beginning of a continual change. To overcome this problem, cumulative Bayes factor (local Bayes factors) is recommended to detect change-point(s) in the sequence of observations, by definingwhere lmax is the maximum number of Bayes factors taken into account. Unlike Bayes factor with implicitly no historical influence in the judgement, the consecutive Bayes factors collect evidence of change over a series of observation (from time\net al. . Akin to the Bayes factor threshold for outlier detection, the threshold of maximal cumulative Bayes factors is set as Lmin ¼ 10. If the conditions Lt > Lmin and lt > lmin occur simultaneously, an alarm of change is immediately issued at time t\n(time of notification, TON). The real time of occurrence (TOC) is (t lt þ 1), that is, TOC =t lt þ 1.Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is performed to assess damage extent and quantify the\nassociated uncertainty. The proposed approach directly quantifies the likelihoods of two scenarios (e.g., the sequential observations before and after the change-point), that is, ‘‘no fault” and ‘‘fault”, and the yielded results are easy to interpret. An\nadditional merit of the proposed approach is its ability to quantify the uncertainty in damage detection. Assume that the observed sequential data can be divided into two non-overlapping partitions, the first of which is regarded as healthy\nof the observations. Thus, the damage detection problem becomes the test of H0 : l ¼ l0 versus H1 : l–l0 with\nWith the above, damage detection can be achieved by means of Bayes factor which is defined as the ratio of the probability of observations given the alternate hypothesis to the probability of observations given the null hypothesiswhere D ¼ yf 1; ; yng refers to the observed data. It is proven to bewhere refers to the mean of the observed data fy1; ; yng. If no prior information is available, the initial mean and variance can be set as q ¼ l0 and s ¼ r 0 [][. The two assumptions take the prior mean and variance in the alternative hypothesis as]where z ¼ pfn **f** i ffi l0 0 [ At each time step (i.e.,][ n][=1), the Bayes factor][ B][ is larger for the larger values of][ z][j j][, which is reasonable]and easy to interpret. The logarithm of the Bayes factor, for convenience of comparison among a larger of values, is derived asIf the Bayes factor B10 is larger than 1, the implication is that the observed data provide evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis H1 (i.e., the structure is damaged). Otherwise, the observed data are judged to support the null hypothesis H0 (i.e.,\nthe structure is healthy). As with the previous threshold, B10 10 is set as a threshold for damage indication.\nIntegrating together the outlier detection, change-point detection and damage assessment, the implementation procedures of the proposed methodology are shown in Fig. 3. Beginning at time t, the single Bayes factor is firstly evaluated to\njudge whether yt is an outlier. If not, the maximum cumulative Bayes factor Lt and run length lt for change-point detection are calculated. Once a change-point is detected, the intervention is carried out by resetting the time to the time of occurrence\n(i.e., TOC = t lt þ 1) and by adjusting the mean value of M0 to the observation yt (i.e., f t ¼ yt), and the subsequent analysis\nwill then be started at TOC. Meanwhile, Bayesian hypothesis testing is executed for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification from the current TOC to the next TOC.4. Application to in-service monitoring data of high-speed trainAn onboard monitoring system has been designed and implemented on an in-service high-speed passenger train running on the Lanzhou-Urumqi High-Speed Railway (LUHSR) in China . As shown in Fig. 4, the monitoring system is composed\nof a total of 52 FBG strain sensors, 4 FBG temperature sensors, 11 accelerometers (tri-axial) and 1 noise sensor deployed on both motor and trailer bogies. Also, one tri-axial FBG accelerometer, one video camera and two GPS sensors are installed inside a train carriage. As the present work is focused on the real-time detection of potentially defective wheels by using strain monitoring data from bogies, only the deployment of strain sensors is concerned. The strain sensors are mounted\non 4 measurement zones of the bogies: (i) the zone with the action of high loads; (ii) the stress transmission zone; (iii)\nthe zone with high responses predicted by finite element analysis; and (iv) welded joints. FBG strain (and temperature) sensors are deployed and attached to the surface of the train bogie with industrial glue and tapes, and connected to the interrogator (data logger) with laptop inside the train carriage through optical fiber cables.\nThe data utilized in this study were obtained from a monitoring schedule spanning 18 days as shown in Table 1. The total length of the LUHSR between Lanzhou and Urumqi is 1777 km. In the trip from Lanzhou to Urumqi, the high-speed train\nstops by 14 stations and travels cross 13 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 13th); in trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou, the high-speed train stops by 15 stations and travels cross 14 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 14th). During the monitoring\nperiod, the train operated at its normal speed around 200–250 km/h. The sampling rate for all the sensors was set at 5000\nSince the train wheels were lathed (lathing is a process to make wheels perfectly rounded) during the monitoring period,\nthe recorded data contain information in line with two different states (before lathing and after lathing). The wheels can be considered as potentially unhealthy (defective) before lathing and as healthy after lathing. To verify the effectiveness of theproposed real-time defect detection methodology, the strain monitoring data obtained from the bogies before and afterThe train’s dynamic responses may be influenced by different subgrade conditions of the railroad, such as ground, tunnel,\nand bridge. To eliminate the effects of different railroad conditions, the strain data recorded from the same railroad sectionbefore and after lathing, are used in each scenario. In addition, the passenger loads in different trips are deemed statistically identical and the speed of train is assumed to be constant as in normal operation. Without loss of generality, the monitoring\ndata respectively obtained from two typical railroad sections (1st and 14th) in the trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou are chosen to illustrate the proposed real-time defect detection methodology, which are from the strain gauge (MS3-7) deployed at the For the sake of brevity, the monitoring data collected from the 1st railroad section are denoted as Case 1, while those from the 14th railroad section are denoted as Case 2. Firstly, the measured strain is converted to stress for the subsequent stress\nrange calculation. For the strain gauges mounted on the steel surface, the conversion of the measured strain to stress is made by rs ¼ Ee, where E is the elasticity modulus of steel and e is the strain after eliminating the effect of varying temperatures.where em is the measured strain, T m is the measured temperature in the vicinity of the strain sensor, T 0 is the temperature at\nthe installation, and a1 is a constant coefficient. In our case, the original temperature is 4, i.e., T 0 ¼ 4. The results of temperature compensation are demonstrated in Fig. 5. It is obvious that the trend in strain responses caused by temperature\nAfterwards, the stress ranges are extracted from the monitoring-derived stress data by the application of the rainflow\ncounting algorithm. From each stress cycle, the stress range Sa is obtained by calculating the difference between the maximum stress rmax and the minimum stress rmin measured in that stress cycle, i.e., Sa ¼ rmax rmin. More details on the stress ranges extraction are given in . The stress ranges with amplitudes lower than 1 MPa need to be culled because the majority are caused by noise. To decrease the uncertainty arising from the measurement facilities, the average stress ranges for\nevery ten minutes are used as the target quantities. Due to the different lengths of the two selected railroad sections (1st and 14th), the traveling time of the train in each section is also different. This results in different data lengths. The data\nlengths of the average stress ranges in Case 1 and Case 2 are 110 and 90, respectively. Figs. and 7 show the original measured strain responses before and after lathing in Case 1 and Case 2, respectively.Following the implementation procedures mentioned before, the defect detection results for Case 1 are demonstrated in\nFigs. and 9. Fig. 8(a) shows the average stress range (red point) together with 1-step ahead prediction (blue solid line) and\nthe corresponding 90% prediction interval (grey shadow). It is observed that, although some observations at the time interval t 2 fall outside the 90% prediction interval, only the Bayes factor at time t ¼ 55 exceeds the established threshold of Hmin ¼ 10 as shown in Fig. 9(a). It is thus judged as an outlier (marked as h). The reason is that because when applying the proposed approach, the shift parameter is set as h ¼ 1:645rt, resulting in the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt while the other\nfour observations are still within the uncertainty limit. On the other hand, Fig. 9(b)–(c) shows the results of the maximum cumulative Bayes factor and the corresponding run length for change detection. It is seen that the maximum cumulative\nBayes factor values at time instants t ¼ 56; 57 and 58 are larger than the threshold of Lmin ¼ 10, while merely the run length at instant t ¼ 58 surpasses the threshold of lmin ¼ 4. Apparently, this observation at time t ¼ 58 fulfills the conditions of change-point detection causing an alarm to be issued (i.e., TON ¼ 58). The identified real occurrence time of change-point is t ¼ 55 (i.e., TOC ¼ 58 4 þ 1 ¼ 55), which coincides well with the actual time point of lathing the wheels. In accordance\nwith the real-time identification of change-point occurrence, the prediction model is refined by altering the guessed mean\nvalue at TOC, as shown in Fig. 8(b). The predictions near TOC in the refined model obviously agree well with the actual observations, thus offering a better prediction performance than that of the original model.\nThe results of defect detection by means of Bayesian hypothesis testing are illustrated in Fig. 9(d). The discrimination between ‘‘healthy” and ‘‘defective” is quantified by the logarithm value of Bayes factor. It is seen from Fig. 9(d) that the vast\nmajority of logarithm values of Bayes factor before TOC are nearly zero and below the threshold level (dotted red line), which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘healthy state” (no defect). This is consistent with the actual health condition and thus validatesthe capability of the Bayesian hypothesis testing. On the contrary, all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than 2, meaning that the corresponding Bayes factor values exceed 100. According to the classification of Bayes factor stipulated in Sub-section 3.1, this result (H > 100) favors the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity is classified as ‘‘decisive”. Indeed, wheels immediately before being sent to depot for lathing were in the state of ‘heavily defective’.\nMaking use of Eq. (21), the probabilities of damage after TOC are obtained as 100%, that is, the wheels are identified as defective with a very high confidence.\nThe defect detection results for Case 2 are similar to Case 1, and are illustrated in Figs. and 11. As seen in Fig. 11(a)–(c)\nno outlier exists throughout the whole period, but a change-point is identified, of which the time of notification is t ¼ 44 (i.e.,\nTON ¼ 44) and the real time of occurrence is t ¼ 41 (i.e., TOC ¼ 44 4 þ 1 ¼ 41). The result matches well with the actual time point when wheel lathing is inflicted. For the predictions near the change-point, the modified prediction model\n(Fig. 10(b)) offers a better performance than the original model (Fig. 10(a)). As illustrated in Fig. 11(d), all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than the threshold (dotted red line), whereas the values before TOC are within thethreshold line. The values of Bayes factor after TOC are obtained to be higher than 100 (H > 100) and the corresponding probabilities of damage are approximately 100%, which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity\nApart from the accuracy of the proposed approach, the computational efficiency is also of concern. The algorithmic implementation is performed on a Lenovo ThinkCentre M720t desktop (Lenovo, Beijing, China) with Dual Intel Core i7-8700 processor (Intel, California, USA) and 24 GB of memory. The computation times consumed in Case 1 and Case 2 are 4.0109 s and\n3.7704 s respectively. In this sense, it realizes the detection of wheel defects in real time.5. ConclusionsA novel methodology for real-time defect detection of high-speed train wheels using Bayesian forecasting and dynamic linear model (DLM) has been developed and validated in this study. First, the DLM is formulated to approximate the actual\nframework. Afterwards, three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) are elicited for outlier detection and change-point detection. After the change-point has been confirmed, damage assessment is executed by the Bayesian hypothesis testing of the sequential observations before and after the change-point. Due to accommodating the dynamic evolution process and the statistical nature of the method, the proposed approach not only possesses the ability of real-time damage detection, but also enables damage quantification (through classifying the range of Bayes factor) and uncertainty assessment (through calculating the probability of damage). The methodology is illustrated by using the onlinelathing). In the two cases addressed, wheel defects are successfully identified, hence validating the effectiveness of the developed method. The quantitative results about the damage extent and confidence would provide useful information helping to\nmake cost-effective, risk-based decisions with the aim of maintaining the operation safety of high-speed rail.\nDespite the proposed methodology being developed for wheel defect detection of high-speed trains, it can also be applied to low-speed passenger and freight trains as well as extended to SHM for a wide variety of civil infrastructure (e.g., bridges,\nbuildings and tunnels) when vibration signals are available via monitoring. In this study, the second-order polynomial DLM\nis employed to model the stress ranges, which only considers the change of stress range level and trend. However, most longterm SHM data, especially long-term strain monitoring data, are generally contaminated by trend, seasonal (cyclical) and\nregression effects, which require a more complex model. The Bayesian DLM enables the modeling of time-dependent responses of a structure by integrating appropriate components, for instance, the response with cyclical characteristics\ncan be depicted by embedding a seasonal (cyclical) component. Thus, in accordance with the nature of monitoring data,\nan appropriate Bayesian DLM enabling to describe time series data of different features, can be formulated for damage detection of a variety of structures subject to different operational/environmental conditions.Administrative Region, China (Project No. PolyU 152024/17E).

The rapid\ngrowth of HSR, however, has posed great challenges regarding operation safety, reliability\nand ride comfort.

To maintain a good service quality and operation safety, it is paramount to develop\nonline monitoring techniques that not only quickly recognize faults of mission-critical HSR components but also can anticipate of long-term mechanisms and gradual deterioration in performance.\nWheelsets in a high-speed train are physically connected with and controlled by the bogie system which corrects alignment for stable running and reduces the vibration caused by wheel-rail interaction . However, the wheel performance\nprogressively deteriorates in different mechanisms (e.g., wheel flat and wheel polygonization) during the routine operation of a high-speed train . Wheel performance deterioration increases stresses experienced by the bogie system. In addition,\nthe increased stress within bogie frames caused by wheel quality deterioration can be unexpectedly large, thus posing a serious threat to the operation safety of concerned trains. According to the statistics of train accidents caused by failure in\nmechanical components during 2004 to 2007 in the United States, the wheelsets faults are the most cause with a rate of\n44.7% . Therefore, the railway managers are keen to keep wheels in an adequate condition and detect potential failure\nas soon as possible. For railway wheels, there are three different ways of estimating the conditions: physical modeling, statistical modeling and condition monitoring . However, the first two ways are not applicable to in-service\nwheel condition assessment, and in contrast, the third way is most feasible for wheel condition estimation. The monitoring approaches available to wheel defect detection can be divided into in-workshop inspection and in-service detection . The\nlatter provides the real-time data required for maintenance planning, while the former is normally carried out at workshops at fixed intervals. The commonly used in-workshop methods for wheel defect inspection include the ultrasonic techniques, infrared camera and magnetic methods . In-service monitoring approaches can be categorized as on-board and wayside methods. The on-board methods implement sensors on the train and continuously obtain comprehensive data from\nthe system. The methods of this category include magnetic technique , ultrasonic technique , acoustic technique, and vibration technique . On the other hand, wayside methods attempt to detect the wheel or vehicle performance\nby installing sensors on the rail or its surrounding areas. Such indirect measurements give rise to limited information of the wheel condition while they can monitor all train wheels going by with using only one or a few sensors. According to the type\nof sensors used, wayside detection approaches include strain sensing technology , fiber optic sensing technology ,\nultrasonic technique , vibration technique , acoustic emission , lasers and high-speed cameras . However,\nthe study on data interpretation techniques enabling the extraction of defect-sensitive features is far from sufficient.\nBayesian dynamic linear model (DLM) is an elegant system approach to handling time series data from a Bayesian perspective, which originates from the field of applied statistics and is extensively used in other fields such as economics\nand engineering [25–30]. The Bayesian DLM treats the time series as the output of a dynamic system perturbed by random disturbances. It is suitable for modeling both univariate and multivariate time series, and also for representing the structural changes, non-stationarity and irregular patterns . Unlike the classical time series method which assumes a fixed relationship between the dependent variables (response variables) and the independent variables (regressors), the DLM considers\nthe relationship changes over time and is able to directly capture time series data features, such as trend, seasonality,\nand regression effects. Moreover, the DLM allows for descriptions of temporary or permanent shifts in time series parameters that occur abruptly, which are necessary for outlier and damage detection in structural health monitoring (SHM) paradigms. Recently, Goulet and his collaborator adopted the Bayesian DLM theory in SHM to model the time-dependent\nresponses of structures by breaking them into subcomponents. In the perspective of real-time damage detection, only few studies are available. The first attempt was conducted by Lipowsky et al. with the development of a Bayesian DLM-based\nreal-time detection algorithm to evaluate the performance of a gas turbine using simulated data. Later on, Wang et al.\nand Zhang et al. adopted the above algorithm for detecting high-speed train defects by using real-world monitoring\ndata. In the previous studies, however, the real-time detection algorithm devised possesses only outlier identification and\nchange detection abilities, without the function of damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.context of Bayesian DLM, which incorporates logics for prognosis, potential outlier detection, identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and damage extent and uncertainty quantification. The Bayesian DLM is considered as a tool\nfor time series analysis, while Bayesian forecasting is executed to enable the calculation of one-step ahead forecast distribution. The change-point detection is performed by checking the current observation against the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM for current instant) as well as against an alternative model of which the mean value\nis shifted by a prescribed offset. The detection rule is that if the alternative model better fits the actual observation, a potential change is signaled. To further determine whether such an observation is only an outlier or the beginning of an actual\nchange (change-point), a specific logic is developed by introducing the Bayes factor and the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.\nThe main contributions of this study are the provision of: (i) a formula which not only enables the modeling of actual framework; (ii) three metrics (i.e., the Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) to allow for outlier\nand change-point detection in real-time manner; and (iii) an efficient way for damage extent assessment and uncertainty\nquantification. The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the Bayesian DLM theory and an elaboration of the Bayesian forecasting philosophy. Section 3 presents the defect detection methodology that incorporates logics for\noutlier detection, change-point identification, and damage assessment. In Section 4, two case studies making use of timeseries strain data acquired by fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors affixed on the bogies of an in-service high-speed train are offered to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the proposed methodology. Finally, conclusions are drawn in2. Bayesian DLM and forecastingThe Bayesian DLM is a kind of process-based Bayesian prediction model which provides a flexible way to intuitively capture how processes evolve over time. It consists of two basic equations: an observation (measurement) equation and a system (evolution) equation . The observation (measurement) equation describes the relationship between the observed\nrandom vectors with mean zero and unknown covariance matrices V t and W t. The DLM defined above amounts to treating ht\nrange level at time t, and at represents the stress range change between time t 1 and t. v t is the zero-mean Gaussian random variable representing the error of measurement at moment t. x1t and x2t are both zero-mean Gaussian random variables representing the evolution of DLM from time t 1 to t. In association with the form of DLM in Equation (1), we haveThe Bayesian forecasting philosophy is based on the description of an observed process using its probability density function (PDF). As implied by the name, the Bayesian forecasting approach commences from Bayes’ theorem, hence enabling the calculation of conditional probabilities. The details of using DLM for the recursive one-step ahead forecasting of the (posterior) distribution of monitoring-derived stress ranges under the Bayesian framework are presented as follows\nNote that in Step 4, Atþ1 is the adaptive coefficient which can be viewed as the information tuner. It scales the correction term according to the relative variances of the prior and likelihood, as measured by Rtþ1=Q tþ1 and regressor value Ftþ1. etþ1 is\nthe one-step forward forecast error, the difference between the observed value ytþ1 and its expectation f tþ1. More details\nabout the recursive one-step ahead forecast method can be found in .3. Defect detection methodologyThe proposed defect detection methodology contains three logical processes: outlier detection, change-point detection,\nand damage assessment. By comparing the real-time measurement with the predicted values, the named outlier detection and change-point detection are devised to determine whether the measurement is a single outlier or the first observation of a remarkable change, the former being executed by calculating the Bayes factor, while the latter being based on the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once a change-point is affirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for further damagePotential outlier detection is the first step in the process of the proposed defect detection approach, accomplished by the Bayes factor calculation. Bayes factor is advocated because of its straightforward and natural interpretation of evidence afforded by data. At every time step t, the Bayesian DLM can yield a PDF for the next measurement, labeled as M0. Meanwhile, an artificial alternative model labeled as M1 is defined by shifting the mean of M0 by +h. The underlying idea of outlier\ndetection is to check the current observation against both M0 and M1. For each time step t, the Bayes factor is the ratio of thewhere yt is the measurement at time t and Dt1 refers to the history information up to time t 1. In the case of Gaussianwhere h is the shift value; yt is the observation value; f t and rt are the mean and standard deviation of the forecasting distribution for observation at time t. A Bayes factor H ¼ 1 indicates that the probability of the observation derived from model M1 is identical to the probability of that derived from Model M0. For better quantitative comparison between any two models, Jeffreys suggested interpreting the Bayes factor as a scale of evidence and provided descriptive statements although\nthe partitions are somewhat arbitrary. According to his suggestion, a Bayes factor can be divided into several intervals for assessing the significance of discrimination: 1 < H < 3 is ‘barely worth mentioning’, 3 < H < 10 is ‘substantial’,\n10 < H < 30 is ‘strong’, 30 < H < 100 is ‘very strong’, and H > 100 is ‘decisive’. In this study, Hmin ¼ 10 is set as a threshold\nAfter the confirmation of Hmin and h, an uncertainty limit (ucl) can be procured by the following equationFor instance, when the confidence level a and threshold of Bayes factor Hmin are set as 90% and 10 respectively, the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt. Thus, an observation is diagnosed as an outlier if its deviation from the mean value of M0 is larger\nWith the Bayes factor defined in Equation (9), only outliers with a positive deviation can be detected. To enable the outliers with negative deviation to be detected as well, a second Bayes factor is defined asIn the automatic monitoring process, both the Bayes factors H1;t and H2;t should be examined in parallel to enable thebehavior, rather than judgments based on long past performances. Change-point is an abrupt variation in time series data,\nrepresenting a transition that occurs between states. Change-point detection aims to detect abrupt change in the generative\nprocess of sequential data. It is assumed that a sequence of observations y1; ; yT could be divided into several nonoverlapping partitions, e.g. dataset j 1, dataset j, and dataset j + 1 as shown in Fig. 2. The delineations between partitions\nare known as change-points (e.g. TOC j 1 and TOC j); the goal of change-point detection is the determination of where the\nboundary of two adjacent partitions is located in a sequence of observations. Change-point detection approaches can be classified into offline and online methods. The former needs to observe the whole sequential observations before aiming to make\ninference on the generative process of the sequence [37–40], wheras the latter aims to update the inference at each time step\nwith the newly acquired measurements from the sequence [41–43]. In particular, the Bayesian online change-point detection methods are based on computing the probability distribution of the run length.differentiate between the single-point outlier and the beginning of a continual change. To overcome this problem, cumulative Bayes factor (local Bayes factors) is recommended to detect change-point(s) in the sequence of observations, by definingwhere lmax is the maximum number of Bayes factors taken into account. Unlike Bayes factor with implicitly no historical influence in the judgement, the consecutive Bayes factors collect evidence of change over a series of observation (from time\net al. . Akin to the Bayes factor threshold for outlier detection, the threshold of maximal cumulative Bayes factors is set as Lmin ¼ 10. If the conditions Lt > Lmin and lt > lmin occur simultaneously, an alarm of change is immediately issued at time t\n(time of notification, TON). The real time of occurrence (TOC) is (t lt þ 1), that is, TOC =t lt þ 1.Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is performed to assess damage extent and quantify the\nassociated uncertainty. The proposed approach directly quantifies the likelihoods of two scenarios (e.g., the sequential observations before and after the change-point), that is, ‘‘no fault” and ‘‘fault”, and the yielded results are easy to interpret. An\nadditional merit of the proposed approach is its ability to quantify the uncertainty in damage detection. Assume that the observed sequential data can be divided into two non-overlapping partitions, the first of which is regarded as healthy\nof the observations. Thus, the damage detection problem becomes the test of H0 : l ¼ l0 versus H1 : l–l0 with\nWith the above, damage detection can be achieved by means of Bayes factor which is defined as the ratio of the probability of observations given the alternate hypothesis to the probability of observations given the null hypothesiswhere D ¼ yf 1; ; yng refers to the observed data. It is proven to bewhere refers to the mean of the observed data fy1; ; yng. If no prior information is available, the initial mean and variance can be set as q ¼ l0 and s ¼ r 0 [][. The two assumptions take the prior mean and variance in the alternative hypothesis as]where z ¼ pfn **f** i ffi l0 0 [ At each time step (i.e.,][ n][=1), the Bayes factor][ B][ is larger for the larger values of][ z][j j][, which is reasonable]and easy to interpret. The logarithm of the Bayes factor, for convenience of comparison among a larger of values, is derived asIf the Bayes factor B10 is larger than 1, the implication is that the observed data provide evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis H1 (i.e., the structure is damaged). Otherwise, the observed data are judged to support the null hypothesis H0 (i.e.,\nthe structure is healthy). As with the previous threshold, B10 10 is set as a threshold for damage indication.\nIntegrating together the outlier detection, change-point detection and damage assessment, the implementation procedures of the proposed methodology are shown in Fig. 3. Beginning at time t, the single Bayes factor is firstly evaluated to\njudge whether yt is an outlier. If not, the maximum cumulative Bayes factor Lt and run length lt for change-point detection are calculated. Once a change-point is detected, the intervention is carried out by resetting the time to the time of occurrence\n(i.e., TOC = t lt þ 1) and by adjusting the mean value of M0 to the observation yt (i.e., f t ¼ yt), and the subsequent analysis\nwill then be started at TOC. Meanwhile, Bayesian hypothesis testing is executed for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification from the current TOC to the next TOC.4. Application to in-service monitoring data of high-speed trainAn onboard monitoring system has been designed and implemented on an in-service high-speed passenger train running on the Lanzhou-Urumqi High-Speed Railway (LUHSR) in China . As shown in Fig. 4, the monitoring system is composed\nof a total of 52 FBG strain sensors, 4 FBG temperature sensors, 11 accelerometers (tri-axial) and 1 noise sensor deployed on both motor and trailer bogies. Also, one tri-axial FBG accelerometer, one video camera and two GPS sensors are installed inside a train carriage. As the present work is focused on the real-time detection of potentially defective wheels by using strain monitoring data from bogies, only the deployment of strain sensors is concerned. The strain sensors are mounted\non 4 measurement zones of the bogies: (i) the zone with the action of high loads; (ii) the stress transmission zone; (iii)\nthe zone with high responses predicted by finite element analysis; and (iv) welded joints. FBG strain (and temperature) sensors are deployed and attached to the surface of the train bogie with industrial glue and tapes, and connected to the interrogator (data logger) with laptop inside the train carriage through optical fiber cables.\nThe data utilized in this study were obtained from a monitoring schedule spanning 18 days as shown in Table 1. The total length of the LUHSR between Lanzhou and Urumqi is 1777 km. In the trip from Lanzhou to Urumqi, the high-speed train\nstops by 14 stations and travels cross 13 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 13th); in trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou, the high-speed train stops by 15 stations and travels cross 14 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 14th). During the monitoring\nperiod, the train operated at its normal speed around 200–250 km/h. The sampling rate for all the sensors was set at 5000\nSince the train wheels were lathed (lathing is a process to make wheels perfectly rounded) during the monitoring period,\nthe recorded data contain information in line with two different states (before lathing and after lathing). The wheels can be considered as potentially unhealthy (defective) before lathing and as healthy after lathing. To verify the effectiveness of theproposed real-time defect detection methodology, the strain monitoring data obtained from the bogies before and afterThe train’s dynamic responses may be influenced by different subgrade conditions of the railroad, such as ground, tunnel,\nand bridge. To eliminate the effects of different railroad conditions, the strain data recorded from the same railroad sectionbefore and after lathing, are used in each scenario. In addition, the passenger loads in different trips are deemed statistically identical and the speed of train is assumed to be constant as in normal operation. Without loss of generality, the monitoring\ndata respectively obtained from two typical railroad sections (1st and 14th) in the trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou are chosen to illustrate the proposed real-time defect detection methodology, which are from the strain gauge (MS3-7) deployed at the For the sake of brevity, the monitoring data collected from the 1st railroad section are denoted as Case 1, while those from the 14th railroad section are denoted as Case 2. Firstly, the measured strain is converted to stress for the subsequent stress\nrange calculation. For the strain gauges mounted on the steel surface, the conversion of the measured strain to stress is made by rs ¼ Ee, where E is the elasticity modulus of steel and e is the strain after eliminating the effect of varying temperatures.where em is the measured strain, T m is the measured temperature in the vicinity of the strain sensor, T 0 is the temperature at\nthe installation, and a1 is a constant coefficient. In our case, the original temperature is 4, i.e., T 0 ¼ 4. The results of temperature compensation are demonstrated in Fig. 5. It is obvious that the trend in strain responses caused by temperature\nAfterwards, the stress ranges are extracted from the monitoring-derived stress data by the application of the rainflow\ncounting algorithm. From each stress cycle, the stress range Sa is obtained by calculating the difference between the maximum stress rmax and the minimum stress rmin measured in that stress cycle, i.e., Sa ¼ rmax rmin. More details on the stress ranges extraction are given in . The stress ranges with amplitudes lower than 1 MPa need to be culled because the majority are caused by noise. To decrease the uncertainty arising from the measurement facilities, the average stress ranges for\nevery ten minutes are used as the target quantities. Due to the different lengths of the two selected railroad sections (1st and 14th), the traveling time of the train in each section is also different. This results in different data lengths. The data\nlengths of the average stress ranges in Case 1 and Case 2 are 110 and 90, respectively. Figs. and 7 show the original measured strain responses before and after lathing in Case 1 and Case 2, respectively.Following the implementation procedures mentioned before, the defect detection results for Case 1 are demonstrated in\nFigs. and 9. Fig. 8(a) shows the average stress range (red point) together with 1-step ahead prediction (blue solid line) and\nthe corresponding 90% prediction interval (grey shadow). It is observed that, although some observations at the time interval t 2 fall outside the 90% prediction interval, only the Bayes factor at time t ¼ 55 exceeds the established threshold of Hmin ¼ 10 as shown in Fig. 9(a). It is thus judged as an outlier (marked as h). The reason is that because when applying the proposed approach, the shift parameter is set as h ¼ 1:645rt, resulting in the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt while the other\nfour observations are still within the uncertainty limit. On the other hand, Fig. 9(b)–(c) shows the results of the maximum cumulative Bayes factor and the corresponding run length for change detection. It is seen that the maximum cumulative\nBayes factor values at time instants t ¼ 56; 57 and 58 are larger than the threshold of Lmin ¼ 10, while merely the run length at instant t ¼ 58 surpasses the threshold of lmin ¼ 4. Apparently, this observation at time t ¼ 58 fulfills the conditions of change-point detection causing an alarm to be issued (i.e., TON ¼ 58). The identified real occurrence time of change-point is t ¼ 55 (i.e., TOC ¼ 58 4 þ 1 ¼ 55), which coincides well with the actual time point of lathing the wheels. In accordance\nwith the real-time identification of change-point occurrence, the prediction model is refined by altering the guessed mean\nvalue at TOC, as shown in Fig. 8(b). The predictions near TOC in the refined model obviously agree well with the actual observations, thus offering a better prediction performance than that of the original model.\nThe results of defect detection by means of Bayesian hypothesis testing are illustrated in Fig. 9(d). The discrimination between ‘‘healthy” and ‘‘defective” is quantified by the logarithm value of Bayes factor. It is seen from Fig. 9(d) that the vast\nmajority of logarithm values of Bayes factor before TOC are nearly zero and below the threshold level (dotted red line), which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘healthy state” (no defect). This is consistent with the actual health condition and thus validatesthe capability of the Bayesian hypothesis testing. On the contrary, all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than 2, meaning that the corresponding Bayes factor values exceed 100. According to the classification of Bayes factor stipulated in Sub-section 3.1, this result (H > 100) favors the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity is classified as ‘‘decisive”. Indeed, wheels immediately before being sent to depot for lathing were in the state of ‘heavily defective’.\nMaking use of Eq. (21), the probabilities of damage after TOC are obtained as 100%, that is, the wheels are identified as defective with a very high confidence.\nThe defect detection results for Case 2 are similar to Case 1, and are illustrated in Figs. and 11. As seen in Fig. 11(a)–(c)\nno outlier exists throughout the whole period, but a change-point is identified, of which the time of notification is t ¼ 44 (i.e.,\nTON ¼ 44) and the real time of occurrence is t ¼ 41 (i.e., TOC ¼ 44 4 þ 1 ¼ 41). The result matches well with the actual time point when wheel lathing is inflicted. For the predictions near the change-point, the modified prediction model\n(Fig. 10(b)) offers a better performance than the original model (Fig. 10(a)). As illustrated in Fig. 11(d), all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than the threshold (dotted red line), whereas the values before TOC are within thethreshold line. The values of Bayes factor after TOC are obtained to be higher than 100 (H > 100) and the corresponding probabilities of damage are approximately 100%, which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity\nApart from the accuracy of the proposed approach, the computational efficiency is also of concern. The algorithmic implementation is performed on a Lenovo ThinkCentre M720t desktop (Lenovo, Beijing, China) with Dual Intel Core i7-8700 processor (Intel, California, USA) and 24 GB of memory. The computation times consumed in Case 1 and Case 2 are 4.0109 s and\n3.7704 s respectively. In this sense, it realizes the detection of wheel defects in real time.5. ConclusionsA novel methodology for real-time defect detection of high-speed train wheels using Bayesian forecasting and dynamic linear model (DLM) has been developed and validated in this study. First, the DLM is formulated to approximate the actual\nframework. Afterwards, three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) are elicited for outlier detection and change-point detection. After the change-point has been confirmed, damage assessment is executed by the Bayesian hypothesis testing of the sequential observations before and after the change-point. Due to accommodating the dynamic evolution process and the statistical nature of the method, the proposed approach not only possesses the ability of real-time damage detection, but also enables damage quantification (through classifying the range of Bayes factor) and uncertainty assessment (through calculating the probability of damage). The methodology is illustrated by using the onlinelathing). In the two cases addressed, wheel defects are successfully identified, hence validating the effectiveness of the developed method. The quantitative results about the damage extent and confidence would provide useful information helping to\nmake cost-effective, risk-based decisions with the aim of maintaining the operation safety of high-speed rail.\nDespite the proposed methodology being developed for wheel defect detection of high-speed trains, it can also be applied to low-speed passenger and freight trains as well as extended to SHM for a wide variety of civil infrastructure (e.g., bridges,\nbuildings and tunnels) when vibration signals are available via monitoring. In this study, the second-order polynomial DLM\nis employed to model the stress ranges, which only considers the change of stress range level and trend. However, most longterm SHM data, especially long-term strain monitoring data, are generally contaminated by trend, seasonal (cyclical) and\nregression effects, which require a more complex model. The Bayesian DLM enables the modeling of time-dependent responses of a structure by integrating appropriate components, for instance, the response with cyclical characteristics\ncan be depicted by embedding a seasonal (cyclical) component. Thus, in accordance with the nature of monitoring data,\nan appropriate Bayesian DLM enabling to describe time series data of different features, can be formulated for damage detection of a variety of structures subject to different operational/environmental conditions.Administrative Region, China (Project No. PolyU 152024/17E).

IntroductionHigh-speed rail (HSR) is being developed in Asian and European countries to satisfy the rapidly growing demand for intercity services and to shore up economic growth. The rapid\ngrowth of HSR, however, has posed great challenges regarding operation safety, reliability\nand ride comfort.

Wheel performance deterioration increases stresses experienced by the bogie system. In addition,\nthe increased stress within bogie frames caused by wheel quality deterioration can be unexpectedly large, thus posing a serious threat to the operation safety of concerned trains. According to the statistics of train accidents caused by failure in\nmechanical components during 2004 to 2007 in the United States, the wheelsets faults are the most cause with a rate of\n44.7% . Therefore, the railway managers are keen to keep wheels in an adequate condition and detect potential failure\nas soon as possible. For railway wheels, there are three different ways of estimating the conditions: physical modeling, statistical modeling and condition monitoring . However, the first two ways are not applicable to in-service\nwheel condition assessment, and in contrast, the third way is most feasible for wheel condition estimation. The monitoring approaches available to wheel defect detection can be divided into in-workshop inspection and in-service detection . The\nlatter provides the real-time data required for maintenance planning, while the former is normally carried out at workshops at fixed intervals. The commonly used in-workshop methods for wheel defect inspection include the ultrasonic techniques, infrared camera and magnetic methods . In-service monitoring approaches can be categorized as on-board and wayside methods. The on-board methods implement sensors on the train and continuously obtain comprehensive data from\nthe system. The methods of this category include magnetic technique , ultrasonic technique , acoustic technique, and vibration technique . On the other hand, wayside methods attempt to detect the wheel or vehicle performance\nby installing sensors on the rail or its surrounding areas. Such indirect measurements give rise to limited information of the wheel condition while they can monitor all train wheels going by with using only one or a few sensors. According to the type\nof sensors used, wayside detection approaches include strain sensing technology , fiber optic sensing technology ,\nultrasonic technique , vibration technique , acoustic emission , lasers and high-speed cameras . However,\nthe study on data interpretation techniques enabling the extraction of defect-sensitive features is far from sufficient.\nBayesian dynamic linear model (DLM) is an elegant system approach to handling time series data from a Bayesian perspective, which originates from the field of applied statistics and is extensively used in other fields such as economics\nand engineering [25–30]. The Bayesian DLM treats the time series as the output of a dynamic system perturbed by random disturbances. It is suitable for modeling both univariate and multivariate time series, and also for representing the structural changes, non-stationarity and irregular patterns . Unlike the classical time series method which assumes a fixed relationship between the dependent variables (response variables) and the independent variables (regressors), the DLM considers\nthe relationship changes over time and is able to directly capture time series data features, such as trend, seasonality,\nand regression effects. Moreover, the DLM allows for descriptions of temporary or permanent shifts in time series parameters that occur abruptly, which are necessary for outlier and damage detection in structural health monitoring (SHM) paradigms. Recently, Goulet and his collaborator adopted the Bayesian DLM theory in SHM to model the time-dependent\nresponses of structures by breaking them into subcomponents. In the perspective of real-time damage detection, only few studies are available. The first attempt was conducted by Lipowsky et al. with the development of a Bayesian DLM-based\nreal-time detection algorithm to evaluate the performance of a gas turbine using simulated data. Later on, Wang et al.\nand Zhang et al. adopted the above algorithm for detecting high-speed train defects by using real-world monitoring\ndata. In the previous studies, however, the real-time detection algorithm devised possesses only outlier identification and\nchange detection abilities, without the function of damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.context of Bayesian DLM, which incorporates logics for prognosis, potential outlier detection, identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and damage extent and uncertainty quantification. The Bayesian DLM is considered as a tool\nfor time series analysis, while Bayesian forecasting is executed to enable the calculation of one-step ahead forecast distribution. The change-point detection is performed by checking the current observation against the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM for current instant) as well as against an alternative model of which the mean value\nis shifted by a prescribed offset. The detection rule is that if the alternative model better fits the actual observation, a potential change is signaled. To further determine whether such an observation is only an outlier or the beginning of an actual\nchange (change-point), a specific logic is developed by introducing the Bayes factor and the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.\nThe main contributions of this study are the provision of: (i) a formula which not only enables the modeling of actual framework; (ii) three metrics (i.e., the Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) to allow for outlier\nand change-point detection in real-time manner; and (iii) an efficient way for damage extent assessment and uncertainty\nquantification. The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the Bayesian DLM theory and an elaboration of the Bayesian forecasting philosophy. Section 3 presents the defect detection methodology that incorporates logics for\noutlier detection, change-point identification, and damage assessment. In Section 4, two case studies making use of timeseries strain data acquired by fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors affixed on the bogies of an in-service high-speed train are offered to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the proposed methodology. Finally, conclusions are drawn in2. Bayesian DLM and forecastingThe Bayesian DLM is a kind of process-based Bayesian prediction model which provides a flexible way to intuitively capture how processes evolve over time. It consists of two basic equations: an observation (measurement) equation and a system (evolution) equation . The observation (measurement) equation describes the relationship between the observed\nrandom vectors with mean zero and unknown covariance matrices V t and W t. The DLM defined above amounts to treating ht\nrange level at time t, and at represents the stress range change between time t 1 and t. v t is the zero-mean Gaussian random variable representing the error of measurement at moment t. x1t and x2t are both zero-mean Gaussian random variables representing the evolution of DLM from time t 1 to t. In association with the form of DLM in Equation (1), we haveThe Bayesian forecasting philosophy is based on the description of an observed process using its probability density function (PDF). As implied by the name, the Bayesian forecasting approach commences from Bayes’ theorem, hence enabling the calculation of conditional probabilities. The details of using DLM for the recursive one-step ahead forecasting of the (posterior) distribution of monitoring-derived stress ranges under the Bayesian framework are presented as follows\nNote that in Step 4, Atþ1 is the adaptive coefficient which can be viewed as the information tuner. It scales the correction term according to the relative variances of the prior and likelihood, as measured by Rtþ1=Q tþ1 and regressor value Ftþ1. etþ1 is\nthe one-step forward forecast error, the difference between the observed value ytþ1 and its expectation f tþ1. More details\nabout the recursive one-step ahead forecast method can be found in .3. Defect detection methodologyThe proposed defect detection methodology contains three logical processes: outlier detection, change-point detection,\nand damage assessment. By comparing the real-time measurement with the predicted values, the named outlier detection and change-point detection are devised to determine whether the measurement is a single outlier or the first observation of a remarkable change, the former being executed by calculating the Bayes factor, while the latter being based on the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once a change-point is affirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for further damagePotential outlier detection is the first step in the process of the proposed defect detection approach, accomplished by the Bayes factor calculation. Bayes factor is advocated because of its straightforward and natural interpretation of evidence afforded by data. At every time step t, the Bayesian DLM can yield a PDF for the next measurement, labeled as M0. Meanwhile, an artificial alternative model labeled as M1 is defined by shifting the mean of M0 by +h. The underlying idea of outlier\ndetection is to check the current observation against both M0 and M1. For each time step t, the Bayes factor is the ratio of thewhere yt is the measurement at time t and Dt1 refers to the history information up to time t 1. In the case of Gaussianwhere h is the shift value; yt is the observation value; f t and rt are the mean and standard deviation of the forecasting distribution for observation at time t. A Bayes factor H ¼ 1 indicates that the probability of the observation derived from model M1 is identical to the probability of that derived from Model M0. For better quantitative comparison between any two models, Jeffreys suggested interpreting the Bayes factor as a scale of evidence and provided descriptive statements although\nthe partitions are somewhat arbitrary. According to his suggestion, a Bayes factor can be divided into several intervals for assessing the significance of discrimination: 1 < H < 3 is ‘barely worth mentioning’, 3 < H < 10 is ‘substantial’,\n10 < H < 30 is ‘strong’, 30 < H < 100 is ‘very strong’, and H > 100 is ‘decisive’. In this study, Hmin ¼ 10 is set as a threshold\nAfter the confirmation of Hmin and h, an uncertainty limit (ucl) can be procured by the following equationFor instance, when the confidence level a and threshold of Bayes factor Hmin are set as 90% and 10 respectively, the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt. Thus, an observation is diagnosed as an outlier if its deviation from the mean value of M0 is larger\nWith the Bayes factor defined in Equation (9), only outliers with a positive deviation can be detected. To enable the outliers with negative deviation to be detected as well, a second Bayes factor is defined asIn the automatic monitoring process, both the Bayes factors H1;t and H2;t should be examined in parallel to enable thebehavior, rather than judgments based on long past performances. Change-point is an abrupt variation in time series data,\nrepresenting a transition that occurs between states. Change-point detection aims to detect abrupt change in the generative\nprocess of sequential data. It is assumed that a sequence of observations y1; ; yT could be divided into several nonoverlapping partitions, e.g. dataset j 1, dataset j, and dataset j + 1 as shown in Fig. 2. The delineations between partitions\nare known as change-points (e.g. TOC j 1 and TOC j); the goal of change-point detection is the determination of where the\nboundary of two adjacent partitions is located in a sequence of observations. Change-point detection approaches can be classified into offline and online methods. The former needs to observe the whole sequential observations before aiming to make\ninference on the generative process of the sequence [37–40], wheras the latter aims to update the inference at each time step\nwith the newly acquired measurements from the sequence [41–43]. In particular, the Bayesian online change-point detection methods are based on computing the probability distribution of the run length.differentiate between the single-point outlier and the beginning of a continual change. To overcome this problem, cumulative Bayes factor (local Bayes factors) is recommended to detect change-point(s) in the sequence of observations, by definingwhere lmax is the maximum number of Bayes factors taken into account. Unlike Bayes factor with implicitly no historical influence in the judgement, the consecutive Bayes factors collect evidence of change over a series of observation (from time\net al. . Akin to the Bayes factor threshold for outlier detection, the threshold of maximal cumulative Bayes factors is set as Lmin ¼ 10. If the conditions Lt > Lmin and lt > lmin occur simultaneously, an alarm of change is immediately issued at time t\n(time of notification, TON). The real time of occurrence (TOC) is (t lt þ 1), that is, TOC =t lt þ 1.Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is performed to assess damage extent and quantify the\nassociated uncertainty. The proposed approach directly quantifies the likelihoods of two scenarios (e.g., the sequential observations before and after the change-point), that is, ‘‘no fault” and ‘‘fault”, and the yielded results are easy to interpret. An\nadditional merit of the proposed approach is its ability to quantify the uncertainty in damage detection. Assume that the observed sequential data can be divided into two non-overlapping partitions, the first of which is regarded as healthy\nof the observations. Thus, the damage detection problem becomes the test of H0 : l ¼ l0 versus H1 : l–l0 with\nWith the above, damage detection can be achieved by means of Bayes factor which is defined as the ratio of the probability of observations given the alternate hypothesis to the probability of observations given the null hypothesiswhere D ¼ yf 1; ; yng refers to the observed data. It is proven to bewhere refers to the mean of the observed data fy1; ; yng. If no prior information is available, the initial mean and variance can be set as q ¼ l0 and s ¼ r 0 [][. The two assumptions take the prior mean and variance in the alternative hypothesis as]where z ¼ pfn **f** i ffi l0 0 [ At each time step (i.e.,][ n][=1), the Bayes factor][ B][ is larger for the larger values of][ z][j j][, which is reasonable]and easy to interpret. The logarithm of the Bayes factor, for convenience of comparison among a larger of values, is derived asIf the Bayes factor B10 is larger than 1, the implication is that the observed data provide evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis H1 (i.e., the structure is damaged). Otherwise, the observed data are judged to support the null hypothesis H0 (i.e.,\nthe structure is healthy). As with the previous threshold, B10 10 is set as a threshold for damage indication.\nIntegrating together the outlier detection, change-point detection and damage assessment, the implementation procedures of the proposed methodology are shown in Fig. 3. Beginning at time t, the single Bayes factor is firstly evaluated to\njudge whether yt is an outlier. If not, the maximum cumulative Bayes factor Lt and run length lt for change-point detection are calculated. Once a change-point is detected, the intervention is carried out by resetting the time to the time of occurrence\n(i.e., TOC = t lt þ 1) and by adjusting the mean value of M0 to the observation yt (i.e., f t ¼ yt), and the subsequent analysis\nwill then be started at TOC. Meanwhile, Bayesian hypothesis testing is executed for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification from the current TOC to the next TOC.4. Application to in-service monitoring data of high-speed trainAn onboard monitoring system has been designed and implemented on an in-service high-speed passenger train running on the Lanzhou-Urumqi High-Speed Railway (LUHSR) in China . As shown in Fig. 4, the monitoring system is composed\nof a total of 52 FBG strain sensors, 4 FBG temperature sensors, 11 accelerometers (tri-axial) and 1 noise sensor deployed on both motor and trailer bogies. Also, one tri-axial FBG accelerometer, one video camera and two GPS sensors are installed inside a train carriage. As the present work is focused on the real-time detection of potentially defective wheels by using strain monitoring data from bogies, only the deployment of strain sensors is concerned. The strain sensors are mounted\non 4 measurement zones of the bogies: (i) the zone with the action of high loads; (ii) the stress transmission zone; (iii)\nthe zone with high responses predicted by finite element analysis; and (iv) welded joints. FBG strain (and temperature) sensors are deployed and attached to the surface of the train bogie with industrial glue and tapes, and connected to the interrogator (data logger) with laptop inside the train carriage through optical fiber cables.\nThe data utilized in this study were obtained from a monitoring schedule spanning 18 days as shown in Table 1. The total length of the LUHSR between Lanzhou and Urumqi is 1777 km. In the trip from Lanzhou to Urumqi, the high-speed train\nstops by 14 stations and travels cross 13 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 13th); in trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou, the high-speed train stops by 15 stations and travels cross 14 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 14th). During the monitoring\nperiod, the train operated at its normal speed around 200–250 km/h. The sampling rate for all the sensors was set at 5000\nSince the train wheels were lathed (lathing is a process to make wheels perfectly rounded) during the monitoring period,\nthe recorded data contain information in line with two different states (before lathing and after lathing). The wheels can be considered as potentially unhealthy (defective) before lathing and as healthy after lathing. To verify the effectiveness of theproposed real-time defect detection methodology, the strain monitoring data obtained from the bogies before and afterThe train’s dynamic responses may be influenced by different subgrade conditions of the railroad, such as ground, tunnel,\nand bridge. To eliminate the effects of different railroad conditions, the strain data recorded from the same railroad sectionbefore and after lathing, are used in each scenario. In addition, the passenger loads in different trips are deemed statistically identical and the speed of train is assumed to be constant as in normal operation. Without loss of generality, the monitoring\ndata respectively obtained from two typical railroad sections (1st and 14th) in the trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou are chosen to illustrate the proposed real-time defect detection methodology, which are from the strain gauge (MS3-7) deployed at the For the sake of brevity, the monitoring data collected from the 1st railroad section are denoted as Case 1, while those from the 14th railroad section are denoted as Case 2. Firstly, the measured strain is converted to stress for the subsequent stress\nrange calculation. For the strain gauges mounted on the steel surface, the conversion of the measured strain to stress is made by rs ¼ Ee, where E is the elasticity modulus of steel and e is the strain after eliminating the effect of varying temperatures.where em is the measured strain, T m is the measured temperature in the vicinity of the strain sensor, T 0 is the temperature at\nthe installation, and a1 is a constant coefficient. In our case, the original temperature is 4, i.e., T 0 ¼ 4. The results of temperature compensation are demonstrated in Fig. 5. It is obvious that the trend in strain responses caused by temperature\nAfterwards, the stress ranges are extracted from the monitoring-derived stress data by the application of the rainflow\ncounting algorithm. From each stress cycle, the stress range Sa is obtained by calculating the difference between the maximum stress rmax and the minimum stress rmin measured in that stress cycle, i.e., Sa ¼ rmax rmin. More details on the stress ranges extraction are given in . The stress ranges with amplitudes lower than 1 MPa need to be culled because the majority are caused by noise. To decrease the uncertainty arising from the measurement facilities, the average stress ranges for\nevery ten minutes are used as the target quantities. Due to the different lengths of the two selected railroad sections (1st and 14th), the traveling time of the train in each section is also different. This results in different data lengths. The data\nlengths of the average stress ranges in Case 1 and Case 2 are 110 and 90, respectively. Figs. and 7 show the original measured strain responses before and after lathing in Case 1 and Case 2, respectively.Following the implementation procedures mentioned before, the defect detection results for Case 1 are demonstrated in\nFigs. and 9. Fig. 8(a) shows the average stress range (red point) together with 1-step ahead prediction (blue solid line) and\nthe corresponding 90% prediction interval (grey shadow). It is observed that, although some observations at the time interval t 2 fall outside the 90% prediction interval, only the Bayes factor at time t ¼ 55 exceeds the established threshold of Hmin ¼ 10 as shown in Fig. 9(a). It is thus judged as an outlier (marked as h). The reason is that because when applying the proposed approach, the shift parameter is set as h ¼ 1:645rt, resulting in the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt while the other\nfour observations are still within the uncertainty limit. On the other hand, Fig. 9(b)–(c) shows the results of the maximum cumulative Bayes factor and the corresponding run length for change detection. It is seen that the maximum cumulative\nBayes factor values at time instants t ¼ 56; 57 and 58 are larger than the threshold of Lmin ¼ 10, while merely the run length at instant t ¼ 58 surpasses the threshold of lmin ¼ 4. Apparently, this observation at time t ¼ 58 fulfills the conditions of change-point detection causing an alarm to be issued (i.e., TON ¼ 58). The identified real occurrence time of change-point is t ¼ 55 (i.e., TOC ¼ 58 4 þ 1 ¼ 55), which coincides well with the actual time point of lathing the wheels. In accordance\nwith the real-time identification of change-point occurrence, the prediction model is refined by altering the guessed mean\nvalue at TOC, as shown in Fig. 8(b). The predictions near TOC in the refined model obviously agree well with the actual observations, thus offering a better prediction performance than that of the original model.\nThe results of defect detection by means of Bayesian hypothesis testing are illustrated in Fig. 9(d). The discrimination between ‘‘healthy” and ‘‘defective” is quantified by the logarithm value of Bayes factor. It is seen from Fig. 9(d) that the vast\nmajority of logarithm values of Bayes factor before TOC are nearly zero and below the threshold level (dotted red line), which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘healthy state” (no defect). This is consistent with the actual health condition and thus validatesthe capability of the Bayesian hypothesis testing. On the contrary, all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than 2, meaning that the corresponding Bayes factor values exceed 100. According to the classification of Bayes factor stipulated in Sub-section 3.1, this result (H > 100) favors the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity is classified as ‘‘decisive”. Indeed, wheels immediately before being sent to depot for lathing were in the state of ‘heavily defective’.\nMaking use of Eq. (21), the probabilities of damage after TOC are obtained as 100%, that is, the wheels are identified as defective with a very high confidence.\nThe defect detection results for Case 2 are similar to Case 1, and are illustrated in Figs. and 11. As seen in Fig. 11(a)–(c)\nno outlier exists throughout the whole period, but a change-point is identified, of which the time of notification is t ¼ 44 (i.e.,\nTON ¼ 44) and the real time of occurrence is t ¼ 41 (i.e., TOC ¼ 44 4 þ 1 ¼ 41). The result matches well with the actual time point when wheel lathing is inflicted. For the predictions near the change-point, the modified prediction model\n(Fig. 10(b)) offers a better performance than the original model (Fig. 10(a)). As illustrated in Fig. 11(d), all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than the threshold (dotted red line), whereas the values before TOC are within thethreshold line. The values of Bayes factor after TOC are obtained to be higher than 100 (H > 100) and the corresponding probabilities of damage are approximately 100%, which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity\nApart from the accuracy of the proposed approach, the computational efficiency is also of concern. The algorithmic implementation is performed on a Lenovo ThinkCentre M720t desktop (Lenovo, Beijing, China) with Dual Intel Core i7-8700 processor (Intel, California, USA) and 24 GB of memory. The computation times consumed in Case 1 and Case 2 are 4.0109 s and\n3.7704 s respectively. In this sense, it realizes the detection of wheel defects in real time.5. ConclusionsA novel methodology for real-time defect detection of high-speed train wheels using Bayesian forecasting and dynamic linear model (DLM) has been developed and validated in this study. First, the DLM is formulated to approximate the actual\nframework. Afterwards, three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) are elicited for outlier detection and change-point detection. After the change-point has been confirmed, damage assessment is executed by the Bayesian hypothesis testing of the sequential observations before and after the change-point. Due to accommodating the dynamic evolution process and the statistical nature of the method, the proposed approach not only possesses the ability of real-time damage detection, but also enables damage quantification (through classifying the range of Bayes factor) and uncertainty assessment (through calculating the probability of damage). The methodology is illustrated by using the onlinelathing). In the two cases addressed, wheel defects are successfully identified, hence validating the effectiveness of the developed method. The quantitative results about the damage extent and confidence would provide useful information helping to\nmake cost-effective, risk-based decisions with the aim of maintaining the operation safety of high-speed rail.\nDespite the proposed methodology being developed for wheel defect detection of high-speed trains, it can also be applied to low-speed passenger and freight trains as well as extended to SHM for a wide variety of civil infrastructure (e.g., bridges,\nbuildings and tunnels) when vibration signals are available via monitoring. In this study, the second-order polynomial DLM\nis employed to model the stress ranges, which only considers the change of stress range level and trend. However, most longterm SHM data, especially long-term strain monitoring data, are generally contaminated by trend, seasonal (cyclical) and\nregression effects, which require a more complex model. The Bayesian DLM enables the modeling of time-dependent responses of a structure by integrating appropriate components, for instance, the response with cyclical characteristics\ncan be depicted by embedding a seasonal (cyclical) component. Thus, in accordance with the nature of monitoring data,\nan appropriate Bayesian DLM enabling to describe time series data of different features, can be formulated for damage detection of a variety of structures subject to different operational/environmental conditions.Administrative Region, China (Project No. PolyU 152024/17E).

Relying on the strain monitoring data acquired from high-speed train bogies, the Bayesian DLM for characterizing the actual stress ranges is established, by which one-step forecast distribution is elicited before proceeding to the\nnext observation.

According to the statistics of train accidents caused by failure in\nmechanical components during 2004 to 2007 in the United States, the wheelsets faults are the most cause with a rate of\n44.7% . Therefore, the railway managers are keen to keep wheels in an adequate condition and detect potential failure\nas soon as possible. For railway wheels, there are three different ways of estimating the conditions: physical modeling, statistical modeling and condition monitoring . However, the first two ways are not applicable to in-service\nwheel condition assessment, and in contrast, the third way is most feasible for wheel condition estimation. The monitoring approaches available to wheel defect detection can be divided into in-workshop inspection and in-service detection . The\nlatter provides the real-time data required for maintenance planning, while the former is normally carried out at workshops at fixed intervals. The commonly used in-workshop methods for wheel defect inspection include the ultrasonic techniques, infrared camera and magnetic methods . In-service monitoring approaches can be categorized as on-board and wayside methods. The on-board methods implement sensors on the train and continuously obtain comprehensive data from\nthe system. The methods of this category include magnetic technique , ultrasonic technique , acoustic technique, and vibration technique . On the other hand, wayside methods attempt to detect the wheel or vehicle performance\nby installing sensors on the rail or its surrounding areas. Such indirect measurements give rise to limited information of the wheel condition while they can monitor all train wheels going by with using only one or a few sensors. According to the type\nof sensors used, wayside detection approaches include strain sensing technology , fiber optic sensing technology ,\nultrasonic technique , vibration technique , acoustic emission , lasers and high-speed cameras . However,\nthe study on data interpretation techniques enabling the extraction of defect-sensitive features is far from sufficient.\nBayesian dynamic linear model (DLM) is an elegant system approach to handling time series data from a Bayesian perspective, which originates from the field of applied statistics and is extensively used in other fields such as economics\nand engineering [25–30]. The Bayesian DLM treats the time series as the output of a dynamic system perturbed by random disturbances. It is suitable for modeling both univariate and multivariate time series, and also for representing the structural changes, non-stationarity and irregular patterns . Unlike the classical time series method which assumes a fixed relationship between the dependent variables (response variables) and the independent variables (regressors), the DLM considers\nthe relationship changes over time and is able to directly capture time series data features, such as trend, seasonality,\nand regression effects. Moreover, the DLM allows for descriptions of temporary or permanent shifts in time series parameters that occur abruptly, which are necessary for outlier and damage detection in structural health monitoring (SHM) paradigms. Recently, Goulet and his collaborator adopted the Bayesian DLM theory in SHM to model the time-dependent\nresponses of structures by breaking them into subcomponents. In the perspective of real-time damage detection, only few studies are available. The first attempt was conducted by Lipowsky et al. with the development of a Bayesian DLM-based\nreal-time detection algorithm to evaluate the performance of a gas turbine using simulated data. Later on, Wang et al.\nand Zhang et al. adopted the above algorithm for detecting high-speed train defects by using real-world monitoring\ndata. In the previous studies, however, the real-time detection algorithm devised possesses only outlier identification and\nchange detection abilities, without the function of damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.context of Bayesian DLM, which incorporates logics for prognosis, potential outlier detection, identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and damage extent and uncertainty quantification. The Bayesian DLM is considered as a tool\nfor time series analysis, while Bayesian forecasting is executed to enable the calculation of one-step ahead forecast distribution. The change-point detection is performed by checking the current observation against the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM for current instant) as well as against an alternative model of which the mean value\nis shifted by a prescribed offset. The detection rule is that if the alternative model better fits the actual observation, a potential change is signaled. To further determine whether such an observation is only an outlier or the beginning of an actual\nchange (change-point), a specific logic is developed by introducing the Bayes factor and the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.\nThe main contributions of this study are the provision of: (i) a formula which not only enables the modeling of actual framework; (ii) three metrics (i.e., the Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) to allow for outlier\nand change-point detection in real-time manner; and (iii) an efficient way for damage extent assessment and uncertainty\nquantification. The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the Bayesian DLM theory and an elaboration of the Bayesian forecasting philosophy. Section 3 presents the defect detection methodology that incorporates logics for\noutlier detection, change-point identification, and damage assessment. In Section 4, two case studies making use of timeseries strain data acquired by fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors affixed on the bogies of an in-service high-speed train are offered to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the proposed methodology. Finally, conclusions are drawn in2. Bayesian DLM and forecastingThe Bayesian DLM is a kind of process-based Bayesian prediction model which provides a flexible way to intuitively capture how processes evolve over time. It consists of two basic equations: an observation (measurement) equation and a system (evolution) equation . The observation (measurement) equation describes the relationship between the observed\nrandom vectors with mean zero and unknown covariance matrices V t and W t. The DLM defined above amounts to treating ht\nrange level at time t, and at represents the stress range change between time t 1 and t. v t is the zero-mean Gaussian random variable representing the error of measurement at moment t. x1t and x2t are both zero-mean Gaussian random variables representing the evolution of DLM from time t 1 to t. In association with the form of DLM in Equation (1), we haveThe Bayesian forecasting philosophy is based on the description of an observed process using its probability density function (PDF). As implied by the name, the Bayesian forecasting approach commences from Bayes’ theorem, hence enabling the calculation of conditional probabilities. The details of using DLM for the recursive one-step ahead forecasting of the (posterior) distribution of monitoring-derived stress ranges under the Bayesian framework are presented as follows\nNote that in Step 4, Atþ1 is the adaptive coefficient which can be viewed as the information tuner. It scales the correction term according to the relative variances of the prior and likelihood, as measured by Rtþ1=Q tþ1 and regressor value Ftþ1. etþ1 is\nthe one-step forward forecast error, the difference between the observed value ytþ1 and its expectation f tþ1. More details\nabout the recursive one-step ahead forecast method can be found in .3. Defect detection methodologyThe proposed defect detection methodology contains three logical processes: outlier detection, change-point detection,\nand damage assessment. By comparing the real-time measurement with the predicted values, the named outlier detection and change-point detection are devised to determine whether the measurement is a single outlier or the first observation of a remarkable change, the former being executed by calculating the Bayes factor, while the latter being based on the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once a change-point is affirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for further damagePotential outlier detection is the first step in the process of the proposed defect detection approach, accomplished by the Bayes factor calculation. Bayes factor is advocated because of its straightforward and natural interpretation of evidence afforded by data. At every time step t, the Bayesian DLM can yield a PDF for the next measurement, labeled as M0. Meanwhile, an artificial alternative model labeled as M1 is defined by shifting the mean of M0 by +h. The underlying idea of outlier\ndetection is to check the current observation against both M0 and M1. For each time step t, the Bayes factor is the ratio of thewhere yt is the measurement at time t and Dt1 refers to the history information up to time t 1. In the case of Gaussianwhere h is the shift value; yt is the observation value; f t and rt are the mean and standard deviation of the forecasting distribution for observation at time t. A Bayes factor H ¼ 1 indicates that the probability of the observation derived from model M1 is identical to the probability of that derived from Model M0. For better quantitative comparison between any two models, Jeffreys suggested interpreting the Bayes factor as a scale of evidence and provided descriptive statements although\nthe partitions are somewhat arbitrary. According to his suggestion, a Bayes factor can be divided into several intervals for assessing the significance of discrimination: 1 < H < 3 is ‘barely worth mentioning’, 3 < H < 10 is ‘substantial’,\n10 < H < 30 is ‘strong’, 30 < H < 100 is ‘very strong’, and H > 100 is ‘decisive’. In this study, Hmin ¼ 10 is set as a threshold\nAfter the confirmation of Hmin and h, an uncertainty limit (ucl) can be procured by the following equationFor instance, when the confidence level a and threshold of Bayes factor Hmin are set as 90% and 10 respectively, the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt. Thus, an observation is diagnosed as an outlier if its deviation from the mean value of M0 is larger\nWith the Bayes factor defined in Equation (9), only outliers with a positive deviation can be detected. To enable the outliers with negative deviation to be detected as well, a second Bayes factor is defined asIn the automatic monitoring process, both the Bayes factors H1;t and H2;t should be examined in parallel to enable thebehavior, rather than judgments based on long past performances. Change-point is an abrupt variation in time series data,\nrepresenting a transition that occurs between states. Change-point detection aims to detect abrupt change in the generative\nprocess of sequential data. It is assumed that a sequence of observations y1; ; yT could be divided into several nonoverlapping partitions, e.g. dataset j 1, dataset j, and dataset j + 1 as shown in Fig. 2. The delineations between partitions\nare known as change-points (e.g. TOC j 1 and TOC j); the goal of change-point detection is the determination of where the\nboundary of two adjacent partitions is located in a sequence of observations. Change-point detection approaches can be classified into offline and online methods. The former needs to observe the whole sequential observations before aiming to make\ninference on the generative process of the sequence [37–40], wheras the latter aims to update the inference at each time step\nwith the newly acquired measurements from the sequence [41–43]. In particular, the Bayesian online change-point detection methods are based on computing the probability distribution of the run length.differentiate between the single-point outlier and the beginning of a continual change. To overcome this problem, cumulative Bayes factor (local Bayes factors) is recommended to detect change-point(s) in the sequence of observations, by definingwhere lmax is the maximum number of Bayes factors taken into account. Unlike Bayes factor with implicitly no historical influence in the judgement, the consecutive Bayes factors collect evidence of change over a series of observation (from time\net al. . Akin to the Bayes factor threshold for outlier detection, the threshold of maximal cumulative Bayes factors is set as Lmin ¼ 10. If the conditions Lt > Lmin and lt > lmin occur simultaneously, an alarm of change is immediately issued at time t\n(time of notification, TON). The real time of occurrence (TOC) is (t lt þ 1), that is, TOC =t lt þ 1.Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is performed to assess damage extent and quantify the\nassociated uncertainty. The proposed approach directly quantifies the likelihoods of two scenarios (e.g., the sequential observations before and after the change-point), that is, ‘‘no fault” and ‘‘fault”, and the yielded results are easy to interpret. An\nadditional merit of the proposed approach is its ability to quantify the uncertainty in damage detection. Assume that the observed sequential data can be divided into two non-overlapping partitions, the first of which is regarded as healthy\nof the observations. Thus, the damage detection problem becomes the test of H0 : l ¼ l0 versus H1 : l–l0 with\nWith the above, damage detection can be achieved by means of Bayes factor which is defined as the ratio of the probability of observations given the alternate hypothesis to the probability of observations given the null hypothesiswhere D ¼ yf 1; ; yng refers to the observed data. It is proven to bewhere refers to the mean of the observed data fy1; ; yng. If no prior information is available, the initial mean and variance can be set as q ¼ l0 and s ¼ r 0 [][. The two assumptions take the prior mean and variance in the alternative hypothesis as]where z ¼ pfn **f** i ffi l0 0 [ At each time step (i.e.,][ n][=1), the Bayes factor][ B][ is larger for the larger values of][ z][j j][, which is reasonable]and easy to interpret. The logarithm of the Bayes factor, for convenience of comparison among a larger of values, is derived asIf the Bayes factor B10 is larger than 1, the implication is that the observed data provide evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis H1 (i.e., the structure is damaged). Otherwise, the observed data are judged to support the null hypothesis H0 (i.e.,\nthe structure is healthy). As with the previous threshold, B10 10 is set as a threshold for damage indication.\nIntegrating together the outlier detection, change-point detection and damage assessment, the implementation procedures of the proposed methodology are shown in Fig. 3. Beginning at time t, the single Bayes factor is firstly evaluated to\njudge whether yt is an outlier. If not, the maximum cumulative Bayes factor Lt and run length lt for change-point detection are calculated. Once a change-point is detected, the intervention is carried out by resetting the time to the time of occurrence\n(i.e., TOC = t lt þ 1) and by adjusting the mean value of M0 to the observation yt (i.e., f t ¼ yt), and the subsequent analysis\nwill then be started at TOC. Meanwhile, Bayesian hypothesis testing is executed for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification from the current TOC to the next TOC.4. Application to in-service monitoring data of high-speed trainAn onboard monitoring system has been designed and implemented on an in-service high-speed passenger train running on the Lanzhou-Urumqi High-Speed Railway (LUHSR) in China . As shown in Fig. 4, the monitoring system is composed\nof a total of 52 FBG strain sensors, 4 FBG temperature sensors, 11 accelerometers (tri-axial) and 1 noise sensor deployed on both motor and trailer bogies. Also, one tri-axial FBG accelerometer, one video camera and two GPS sensors are installed inside a train carriage. As the present work is focused on the real-time detection of potentially defective wheels by using strain monitoring data from bogies, only the deployment of strain sensors is concerned. The strain sensors are mounted\non 4 measurement zones of the bogies: (i) the zone with the action of high loads; (ii) the stress transmission zone; (iii)\nthe zone with high responses predicted by finite element analysis; and (iv) welded joints. FBG strain (and temperature) sensors are deployed and attached to the surface of the train bogie with industrial glue and tapes, and connected to the interrogator (data logger) with laptop inside the train carriage through optical fiber cables.\nThe data utilized in this study were obtained from a monitoring schedule spanning 18 days as shown in Table 1. The total length of the LUHSR between Lanzhou and Urumqi is 1777 km. In the trip from Lanzhou to Urumqi, the high-speed train\nstops by 14 stations and travels cross 13 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 13th); in trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou, the high-speed train stops by 15 stations and travels cross 14 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 14th). During the monitoring\nperiod, the train operated at its normal speed around 200–250 km/h. The sampling rate for all the sensors was set at 5000\nSince the train wheels were lathed (lathing is a process to make wheels perfectly rounded) during the monitoring period,\nthe recorded data contain information in line with two different states (before lathing and after lathing). The wheels can be considered as potentially unhealthy (defective) before lathing and as healthy after lathing. To verify the effectiveness of theproposed real-time defect detection methodology, the strain monitoring data obtained from the bogies before and afterThe train’s dynamic responses may be influenced by different subgrade conditions of the railroad, such as ground, tunnel,\nand bridge. To eliminate the effects of different railroad conditions, the strain data recorded from the same railroad sectionbefore and after lathing, are used in each scenario. In addition, the passenger loads in different trips are deemed statistically identical and the speed of train is assumed to be constant as in normal operation. Without loss of generality, the monitoring\ndata respectively obtained from two typical railroad sections (1st and 14th) in the trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou are chosen to illustrate the proposed real-time defect detection methodology, which are from the strain gauge (MS3-7) deployed at the For the sake of brevity, the monitoring data collected from the 1st railroad section are denoted as Case 1, while those from the 14th railroad section are denoted as Case 2. Firstly, the measured strain is converted to stress for the subsequent stress\nrange calculation. For the strain gauges mounted on the steel surface, the conversion of the measured strain to stress is made by rs ¼ Ee, where E is the elasticity modulus of steel and e is the strain after eliminating the effect of varying temperatures.where em is the measured strain, T m is the measured temperature in the vicinity of the strain sensor, T 0 is the temperature at\nthe installation, and a1 is a constant coefficient. In our case, the original temperature is 4, i.e., T 0 ¼ 4. The results of temperature compensation are demonstrated in Fig. 5. It is obvious that the trend in strain responses caused by temperature\nAfterwards, the stress ranges are extracted from the monitoring-derived stress data by the application of the rainflow\ncounting algorithm. From each stress cycle, the stress range Sa is obtained by calculating the difference between the maximum stress rmax and the minimum stress rmin measured in that stress cycle, i.e., Sa ¼ rmax rmin. More details on the stress ranges extraction are given in . The stress ranges with amplitudes lower than 1 MPa need to be culled because the majority are caused by noise. To decrease the uncertainty arising from the measurement facilities, the average stress ranges for\nevery ten minutes are used as the target quantities. Due to the different lengths of the two selected railroad sections (1st and 14th), the traveling time of the train in each section is also different. This results in different data lengths. The data\nlengths of the average stress ranges in Case 1 and Case 2 are 110 and 90, respectively. Figs. and 7 show the original measured strain responses before and after lathing in Case 1 and Case 2, respectively.Following the implementation procedures mentioned before, the defect detection results for Case 1 are demonstrated in\nFigs. and 9. Fig. 8(a) shows the average stress range (red point) together with 1-step ahead prediction (blue solid line) and\nthe corresponding 90% prediction interval (grey shadow). It is observed that, although some observations at the time interval t 2 fall outside the 90% prediction interval, only the Bayes factor at time t ¼ 55 exceeds the established threshold of Hmin ¼ 10 as shown in Fig. 9(a). It is thus judged as an outlier (marked as h). The reason is that because when applying the proposed approach, the shift parameter is set as h ¼ 1:645rt, resulting in the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt while the other\nfour observations are still within the uncertainty limit. On the other hand, Fig. 9(b)–(c) shows the results of the maximum cumulative Bayes factor and the corresponding run length for change detection. It is seen that the maximum cumulative\nBayes factor values at time instants t ¼ 56; 57 and 58 are larger than the threshold of Lmin ¼ 10, while merely the run length at instant t ¼ 58 surpasses the threshold of lmin ¼ 4. Apparently, this observation at time t ¼ 58 fulfills the conditions of change-point detection causing an alarm to be issued (i.e., TON ¼ 58). The identified real occurrence time of change-point is t ¼ 55 (i.e., TOC ¼ 58 4 þ 1 ¼ 55), which coincides well with the actual time point of lathing the wheels. In accordance\nwith the real-time identification of change-point occurrence, the prediction model is refined by altering the guessed mean\nvalue at TOC, as shown in Fig. 8(b). The predictions near TOC in the refined model obviously agree well with the actual observations, thus offering a better prediction performance than that of the original model.\nThe results of defect detection by means of Bayesian hypothesis testing are illustrated in Fig. 9(d). The discrimination between ‘‘healthy” and ‘‘defective” is quantified by the logarithm value of Bayes factor. It is seen from Fig. 9(d) that the vast\nmajority of logarithm values of Bayes factor before TOC are nearly zero and below the threshold level (dotted red line), which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘healthy state” (no defect). This is consistent with the actual health condition and thus validatesthe capability of the Bayesian hypothesis testing. On the contrary, all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than 2, meaning that the corresponding Bayes factor values exceed 100. According to the classification of Bayes factor stipulated in Sub-section 3.1, this result (H > 100) favors the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity is classified as ‘‘decisive”. Indeed, wheels immediately before being sent to depot for lathing were in the state of ‘heavily defective’.\nMaking use of Eq. (21), the probabilities of damage after TOC are obtained as 100%, that is, the wheels are identified as defective with a very high confidence.\nThe defect detection results for Case 2 are similar to Case 1, and are illustrated in Figs. and 11. As seen in Fig. 11(a)–(c)\nno outlier exists throughout the whole period, but a change-point is identified, of which the time of notification is t ¼ 44 (i.e.,\nTON ¼ 44) and the real time of occurrence is t ¼ 41 (i.e., TOC ¼ 44 4 þ 1 ¼ 41). The result matches well with the actual time point when wheel lathing is inflicted. For the predictions near the change-point, the modified prediction model\n(Fig. 10(b)) offers a better performance than the original model (Fig. 10(a)). As illustrated in Fig. 11(d), all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than the threshold (dotted red line), whereas the values before TOC are within thethreshold line. The values of Bayes factor after TOC are obtained to be higher than 100 (H > 100) and the corresponding probabilities of damage are approximately 100%, which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity\nApart from the accuracy of the proposed approach, the computational efficiency is also of concern. The algorithmic implementation is performed on a Lenovo ThinkCentre M720t desktop (Lenovo, Beijing, China) with Dual Intel Core i7-8700 processor (Intel, California, USA) and 24 GB of memory. The computation times consumed in Case 1 and Case 2 are 4.0109 s and\n3.7704 s respectively. In this sense, it realizes the detection of wheel defects in real time.5. ConclusionsA novel methodology for real-time defect detection of high-speed train wheels using Bayesian forecasting and dynamic linear model (DLM) has been developed and validated in this study. First, the DLM is formulated to approximate the actual\nframework. Afterwards, three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) are elicited for outlier detection and change-point detection. After the change-point has been confirmed, damage assessment is executed by the Bayesian hypothesis testing of the sequential observations before and after the change-point. Due to accommodating the dynamic evolution process and the statistical nature of the method, the proposed approach not only possesses the ability of real-time damage detection, but also enables damage quantification (through classifying the range of Bayes factor) and uncertainty assessment (through calculating the probability of damage). The methodology is illustrated by using the onlinelathing). In the two cases addressed, wheel defects are successfully identified, hence validating the effectiveness of the developed method. The quantitative results about the damage extent and confidence would provide useful information helping to\nmake cost-effective, risk-based decisions with the aim of maintaining the operation safety of high-speed rail.\nDespite the proposed methodology being developed for wheel defect detection of high-speed trains, it can also be applied to low-speed passenger and freight trains as well as extended to SHM for a wide variety of civil infrastructure (e.g., bridges,\nbuildings and tunnels) when vibration signals are available via monitoring. In this study, the second-order polynomial DLM\nis employed to model the stress ranges, which only considers the change of stress range level and trend. However, most longterm SHM data, especially long-term strain monitoring data, are generally contaminated by trend, seasonal (cyclical) and\nregression effects, which require a more complex model. The Bayesian DLM enables the modeling of time-dependent responses of a structure by integrating appropriate components, for instance, the response with cyclical characteristics\ncan be depicted by embedding a seasonal (cyclical) component. Thus, in accordance with the nature of monitoring data,\nan appropriate Bayesian DLM enabling to describe time series data of different features, can be formulated for damage detection of a variety of structures subject to different operational/environmental conditions.Administrative Region, China (Project No. PolyU 152024/17E).

The rapid\ngrowth of HSR, however, has posed great challenges regarding operation safety, reliability\nand ride comfort.

The proposed methodology embraces logics for (i) prognosis, (ii) potential outlier\ndetection, (iii) identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and (iv) quantification of damage extent and uncertainty. Relying on the strain monitoring data acquired from high-speed train bogies, the Bayesian DLM for characterizing the actual stress ranges is established, by which one-step forecast distribution is elicited before proceeding to the\nnext observation. The detection of change-point is executed by comparing the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM) and an alternative model\n(the mean value is shifted by a prescribed offset) to determine which better fits the actual observation.

Rail accidents were occasionally caused by failures such as severe defects or fatigue of railway components. To maintain a good service quality and operation safety, it is paramount to develop\nonline monitoring techniques that not only quickly recognize faults of mission-critical HSR components but also can anticipate of long-term mechanisms and gradual deterioration in performance.\nWheelsets in a high-speed train are physically connected with and controlled by the bogie system which corrects alignment for stable running and reduces the vibration caused by wheel-rail interaction . However, the wheel performance\nprogressively deteriorates in different mechanisms (e.g., wheel flat and wheel polygonization) during the routine operation of a high-speed train . Wheel performance deterioration increases stresses experienced by the bogie system. In addition,\nthe increased stress within bogie frames caused by wheel quality deterioration can be unexpectedly large, thus posing a serious threat to the operation safety of concerned trains. According to the statistics of train accidents caused by failure in\nmechanical components during 2004 to 2007 in the United States, the wheelsets faults are the most cause with a rate of\n44.7% . Therefore, the railway managers are keen to keep wheels in an adequate condition and detect potential failure\nas soon as possible.

The\nlatter provides the real-time data required for maintenance planning, while the former is normally carried out at workshops at fixed intervals. The commonly used in-workshop methods for wheel defect inspection include the ultrasonic techniques, infrared camera and magnetic methods . In-service monitoring approaches can be categorized as on-board and wayside methods. The on-board methods implement sensors on the train and continuously obtain comprehensive data from\nthe system. The methods of this category include magnetic technique , ultrasonic technique , acoustic technique, and vibration technique . On the other hand, wayside methods attempt to detect the wheel or vehicle performance\nby installing sensors on the rail or its surrounding areas. Such indirect measurements give rise to limited information of the wheel condition while they can monitor all train wheels going by with using only one or a few sensors. According to the type\nof sensors used, wayside detection approaches include strain sensing technology , fiber optic sensing technology ,\nultrasonic technique , vibration technique , acoustic emission , lasers and high-speed cameras . However,\nthe study on data interpretation techniques enabling the extraction of defect-sensitive features is far from sufficient.\nBayesian dynamic linear model (DLM) is an elegant system approach to handling time series data from a Bayesian perspective, which originates from the field of applied statistics and is extensively used in other fields such as economics\nand engineering [25–30]. The Bayesian DLM treats the time series as the output of a dynamic system perturbed by random disturbances. It is suitable for modeling both univariate and multivariate time series, and also for representing the structural changes, non-stationarity and irregular patterns . Unlike the classical time series method which assumes a fixed relationship between the dependent variables (response variables) and the independent variables (regressors), the DLM considers\nthe relationship changes over time and is able to directly capture time series data features, such as trend, seasonality,\nand regression effects. Moreover, the DLM allows for descriptions of temporary or permanent shifts in time series parameters that occur abruptly, which are necessary for outlier and damage detection in structural health monitoring (SHM) paradigms. Recently, Goulet and his collaborator adopted the Bayesian DLM theory in SHM to model the time-dependent\nresponses of structures by breaking them into subcomponents. In the perspective of real-time damage detection, only few studies are available. The first attempt was conducted by Lipowsky et al. with the development of a Bayesian DLM-based\nreal-time detection algorithm to evaluate the performance of a gas turbine using simulated data. Later on, Wang et al.\nand Zhang et al. adopted the above algorithm for detecting high-speed train defects by using real-world monitoring\ndata. In the previous studies, however, the real-time detection algorithm devised possesses only outlier identification and\nchange detection abilities, without the function of damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.context of Bayesian DLM, which incorporates logics for prognosis, potential outlier detection, identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and damage extent and uncertainty quantification. The Bayesian DLM is considered as a tool\nfor time series analysis, while Bayesian forecasting is executed to enable the calculation of one-step ahead forecast distribution. The change-point detection is performed by checking the current observation against the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM for current instant) as well as against an alternative model of which the mean value\nis shifted by a prescribed offset. The detection rule is that if the alternative model better fits the actual observation, a potential change is signaled. To further determine whether such an observation is only an outlier or the beginning of an actual\nchange (change-point), a specific logic is developed by introducing the Bayes factor and the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.\nThe main contributions of this study are the provision of: (i) a formula which not only enables the modeling of actual framework; (ii) three metrics (i.e., the Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) to allow for outlier\nand change-point detection in real-time manner; and (iii) an efficient way for damage extent assessment and uncertainty\nquantification. The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the Bayesian DLM theory and an elaboration of the Bayesian forecasting philosophy. Section 3 presents the defect detection methodology that incorporates logics for\noutlier detection, change-point identification, and damage assessment. In Section 4, two case studies making use of timeseries strain data acquired by fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors affixed on the bogies of an in-service high-speed train are offered to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the proposed methodology. Finally, conclusions are drawn in2. Bayesian DLM and forecastingThe Bayesian DLM is a kind of process-based Bayesian prediction model which provides a flexible way to intuitively capture how processes evolve over time. It consists of two basic equations: an observation (measurement) equation and a system (evolution) equation . The observation (measurement) equation describes the relationship between the observed\nrandom vectors with mean zero and unknown covariance matrices V t and W t. The DLM defined above amounts to treating ht\nrange level at time t, and at represents the stress range change between time t 1 and t. v t is the zero-mean Gaussian random variable representing the error of measurement at moment t. x1t and x2t are both zero-mean Gaussian random variables representing the evolution of DLM from time t 1 to t. In association with the form of DLM in Equation (1), we haveThe Bayesian forecasting philosophy is based on the description of an observed process using its probability density function (PDF). As implied by the name, the Bayesian forecasting approach commences from Bayes’ theorem, hence enabling the calculation of conditional probabilities. The details of using DLM for the recursive one-step ahead forecasting of the (posterior) distribution of monitoring-derived stress ranges under the Bayesian framework are presented as follows\nNote that in Step 4, Atþ1 is the adaptive coefficient which can be viewed as the information tuner. It scales the correction term according to the relative variances of the prior and likelihood, as measured by Rtþ1=Q tþ1 and regressor value Ftþ1. etþ1 is\nthe one-step forward forecast error, the difference between the observed value ytþ1 and its expectation f tþ1. More details\nabout the recursive one-step ahead forecast method can be found in .3. Defect detection methodologyThe proposed defect detection methodology contains three logical processes: outlier detection, change-point detection,\nand damage assessment. By comparing the real-time measurement with the predicted values, the named outlier detection and change-point detection are devised to determine whether the measurement is a single outlier or the first observation of a remarkable change, the former being executed by calculating the Bayes factor, while the latter being based on the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once a change-point is affirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for further damagePotential outlier detection is the first step in the process of the proposed defect detection approach, accomplished by the Bayes factor calculation. Bayes factor is advocated because of its straightforward and natural interpretation of evidence afforded by data. At every time step t, the Bayesian DLM can yield a PDF for the next measurement, labeled as M0. Meanwhile, an artificial alternative model labeled as M1 is defined by shifting the mean of M0 by +h. The underlying idea of outlier\ndetection is to check the current observation against both M0 and M1. For each time step t, the Bayes factor is the ratio of thewhere yt is the measurement at time t and Dt1 refers to the history information up to time t 1. In the case of Gaussianwhere h is the shift value; yt is the observation value; f t and rt are the mean and standard deviation of the forecasting distribution for observation at time t. A Bayes factor H ¼ 1 indicates that the probability of the observation derived from model M1 is identical to the probability of that derived from Model M0. For better quantitative comparison between any two models, Jeffreys suggested interpreting the Bayes factor as a scale of evidence and provided descriptive statements although\nthe partitions are somewhat arbitrary. According to his suggestion, a Bayes factor can be divided into several intervals for assessing the significance of discrimination: 1 < H < 3 is ‘barely worth mentioning’, 3 < H < 10 is ‘substantial’,\n10 < H < 30 is ‘strong’, 30 < H < 100 is ‘very strong’, and H > 100 is ‘decisive’. In this study, Hmin ¼ 10 is set as a threshold\nAfter the confirmation of Hmin and h, an uncertainty limit (ucl) can be procured by the following equationFor instance, when the confidence level a and threshold of Bayes factor Hmin are set as 90% and 10 respectively, the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt. Thus, an observation is diagnosed as an outlier if its deviation from the mean value of M0 is larger\nWith the Bayes factor defined in Equation (9), only outliers with a positive deviation can be detected. To enable the outliers with negative deviation to be detected as well, a second Bayes factor is defined asIn the automatic monitoring process, both the Bayes factors H1;t and H2;t should be examined in parallel to enable thebehavior, rather than judgments based on long past performances. Change-point is an abrupt variation in time series data,\nrepresenting a transition that occurs between states. Change-point detection aims to detect abrupt change in the generative\nprocess of sequential data. It is assumed that a sequence of observations y1; ; yT could be divided into several nonoverlapping partitions, e.g. dataset j 1, dataset j, and dataset j + 1 as shown in Fig. 2. The delineations between partitions\nare known as change-points (e.g. TOC j 1 and TOC j); the goal of change-point detection is the determination of where the\nboundary of two adjacent partitions is located in a sequence of observations. Change-point detection approaches can be classified into offline and online methods. The former needs to observe the whole sequential observations before aiming to make\ninference on the generative process of the sequence [37–40], wheras the latter aims to update the inference at each time step\nwith the newly acquired measurements from the sequence [41–43]. In particular, the Bayesian online change-point detection methods are based on computing the probability distribution of the run length.differentiate between the single-point outlier and the beginning of a continual change. To overcome this problem, cumulative Bayes factor (local Bayes factors) is recommended to detect change-point(s) in the sequence of observations, by definingwhere lmax is the maximum number of Bayes factors taken into account. Unlike Bayes factor with implicitly no historical influence in the judgement, the consecutive Bayes factors collect evidence of change over a series of observation (from time\net al. . Akin to the Bayes factor threshold for outlier detection, the threshold of maximal cumulative Bayes factors is set as Lmin ¼ 10. If the conditions Lt > Lmin and lt > lmin occur simultaneously, an alarm of change is immediately issued at time t\n(time of notification, TON). The real time of occurrence (TOC) is (t lt þ 1), that is, TOC =t lt þ 1.Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is performed to assess damage extent and quantify the\nassociated uncertainty. The proposed approach directly quantifies the likelihoods of two scenarios (e.g., the sequential observations before and after the change-point), that is, ‘‘no fault” and ‘‘fault”, and the yielded results are easy to interpret. An\nadditional merit of the proposed approach is its ability to quantify the uncertainty in damage detection. Assume that the observed sequential data can be divided into two non-overlapping partitions, the first of which is regarded as healthy\nof the observations. Thus, the damage detection problem becomes the test of H0 : l ¼ l0 versus H1 : l–l0 with\nWith the above, damage detection can be achieved by means of Bayes factor which is defined as the ratio of the probability of observations given the alternate hypothesis to the probability of observations given the null hypothesiswhere D ¼ yf 1; ; yng refers to the observed data. It is proven to bewhere refers to the mean of the observed data fy1; ; yng. If no prior information is available, the initial mean and variance can be set as q ¼ l0 and s ¼ r 0 [][. The two assumptions take the prior mean and variance in the alternative hypothesis as]where z ¼ pfn **f** i ffi l0 0 [ At each time step (i.e.,][ n][=1), the Bayes factor][ B][ is larger for the larger values of][ z][j j][, which is reasonable]and easy to interpret. The logarithm of the Bayes factor, for convenience of comparison among a larger of values, is derived asIf the Bayes factor B10 is larger than 1, the implication is that the observed data provide evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis H1 (i.e., the structure is damaged). Otherwise, the observed data are judged to support the null hypothesis H0 (i.e.,\nthe structure is healthy). As with the previous threshold, B10 10 is set as a threshold for damage indication.\nIntegrating together the outlier detection, change-point detection and damage assessment, the implementation procedures of the proposed methodology are shown in Fig. 3. Beginning at time t, the single Bayes factor is firstly evaluated to\njudge whether yt is an outlier. If not, the maximum cumulative Bayes factor Lt and run length lt for change-point detection are calculated. Once a change-point is detected, the intervention is carried out by resetting the time to the time of occurrence\n(i.e., TOC = t lt þ 1) and by adjusting the mean value of M0 to the observation yt (i.e., f t ¼ yt), and the subsequent analysis\nwill then be started at TOC. Meanwhile, Bayesian hypothesis testing is executed for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification from the current TOC to the next TOC.4. Application to in-service monitoring data of high-speed trainAn onboard monitoring system has been designed and implemented on an in-service high-speed passenger train running on the Lanzhou-Urumqi High-Speed Railway (LUHSR) in China . As shown in Fig. 4, the monitoring system is composed\nof a total of 52 FBG strain sensors, 4 FBG temperature sensors, 11 accelerometers (tri-axial) and 1 noise sensor deployed on both motor and trailer bogies. Also, one tri-axial FBG accelerometer, one video camera and two GPS sensors are installed inside a train carriage. As the present work is focused on the real-time detection of potentially defective wheels by using strain monitoring data from bogies, only the deployment of strain sensors is concerned. The strain sensors are mounted\non 4 measurement zones of the bogies: (i) the zone with the action of high loads; (ii) the stress transmission zone; (iii)\nthe zone with high responses predicted by finite element analysis; and (iv) welded joints. FBG strain (and temperature) sensors are deployed and attached to the surface of the train bogie with industrial glue and tapes, and connected to the interrogator (data logger) with laptop inside the train carriage through optical fiber cables.\nThe data utilized in this study were obtained from a monitoring schedule spanning 18 days as shown in Table 1. The total length of the LUHSR between Lanzhou and Urumqi is 1777 km. In the trip from Lanzhou to Urumqi, the high-speed train\nstops by 14 stations and travels cross 13 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 13th); in trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou, the high-speed train stops by 15 stations and travels cross 14 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 14th). During the monitoring\nperiod, the train operated at its normal speed around 200–250 km/h. The sampling rate for all the sensors was set at 5000\nSince the train wheels were lathed (lathing is a process to make wheels perfectly rounded) during the monitoring period,\nthe recorded data contain information in line with two different states (before lathing and after lathing). The wheels can be considered as potentially unhealthy (defective) before lathing and as healthy after lathing. To verify the effectiveness of theproposed real-time defect detection methodology, the strain monitoring data obtained from the bogies before and afterThe train’s dynamic responses may be influenced by different subgrade conditions of the railroad, such as ground, tunnel,\nand bridge. To eliminate the effects of different railroad conditions, the strain data recorded from the same railroad sectionbefore and after lathing, are used in each scenario. In addition, the passenger loads in different trips are deemed statistically identical and the speed of train is assumed to be constant as in normal operation. Without loss of generality, the monitoring\ndata respectively obtained from two typical railroad sections (1st and 14th) in the trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou are chosen to illustrate the proposed real-time defect detection methodology, which are from the strain gauge (MS3-7) deployed at the For the sake of brevity, the monitoring data collected from the 1st railroad section are denoted as Case 1, while those from the 14th railroad section are denoted as Case 2. Firstly, the measured strain is converted to stress for the subsequent stress\nrange calculation. For the strain gauges mounted on the steel surface, the conversion of the measured strain to stress is made by rs ¼ Ee, where E is the elasticity modulus of steel and e is the strain after eliminating the effect of varying temperatures.where em is the measured strain, T m is the measured temperature in the vicinity of the strain sensor, T 0 is the temperature at\nthe installation, and a1 is a constant coefficient. In our case, the original temperature is 4, i.e., T 0 ¼ 4. The results of temperature compensation are demonstrated in Fig. 5. It is obvious that the trend in strain responses caused by temperature\nAfterwards, the stress ranges are extracted from the monitoring-derived stress data by the application of the rainflow\ncounting algorithm. From each stress cycle, the stress range Sa is obtained by calculating the difference between the maximum stress rmax and the minimum stress rmin measured in that stress cycle, i.e., Sa ¼ rmax rmin. More details on the stress ranges extraction are given in . The stress ranges with amplitudes lower than 1 MPa need to be culled because the majority are caused by noise. To decrease the uncertainty arising from the measurement facilities, the average stress ranges for\nevery ten minutes are used as the target quantities. Due to the different lengths of the two selected railroad sections (1st and 14th), the traveling time of the train in each section is also different. This results in different data lengths. The data\nlengths of the average stress ranges in Case 1 and Case 2 are 110 and 90, respectively. Figs. and 7 show the original measured strain responses before and after lathing in Case 1 and Case 2, respectively.Following the implementation procedures mentioned before, the defect detection results for Case 1 are demonstrated in\nFigs. and 9. Fig. 8(a) shows the average stress range (red point) together with 1-step ahead prediction (blue solid line) and\nthe corresponding 90% prediction interval (grey shadow). It is observed that, although some observations at the time interval t 2 fall outside the 90% prediction interval, only the Bayes factor at time t ¼ 55 exceeds the established threshold of Hmin ¼ 10 as shown in Fig. 9(a). It is thus judged as an outlier (marked as h). The reason is that because when applying the proposed approach, the shift parameter is set as h ¼ 1:645rt, resulting in the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt while the other\nfour observations are still within the uncertainty limit. On the other hand, Fig. 9(b)–(c) shows the results of the maximum cumulative Bayes factor and the corresponding run length for change detection. It is seen that the maximum cumulative\nBayes factor values at time instants t ¼ 56; 57 and 58 are larger than the threshold of Lmin ¼ 10, while merely the run length at instant t ¼ 58 surpasses the threshold of lmin ¼ 4. Apparently, this observation at time t ¼ 58 fulfills the conditions of change-point detection causing an alarm to be issued (i.e., TON ¼ 58). The identified real occurrence time of change-point is t ¼ 55 (i.e., TOC ¼ 58 4 þ 1 ¼ 55), which coincides well with the actual time point of lathing the wheels. In accordance\nwith the real-time identification of change-point occurrence, the prediction model is refined by altering the guessed mean\nvalue at TOC, as shown in Fig. 8(b). The predictions near TOC in the refined model obviously agree well with the actual observations, thus offering a better prediction performance than that of the original model.\nThe results of defect detection by means of Bayesian hypothesis testing are illustrated in Fig. 9(d). The discrimination between ‘‘healthy” and ‘‘defective” is quantified by the logarithm value of Bayes factor. It is seen from Fig. 9(d) that the vast\nmajority of logarithm values of Bayes factor before TOC are nearly zero and below the threshold level (dotted red line), which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘healthy state” (no defect). This is consistent with the actual health condition and thus validatesthe capability of the Bayesian hypothesis testing. On the contrary, all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than 2, meaning that the corresponding Bayes factor values exceed 100. According to the classification of Bayes factor stipulated in Sub-section 3.1, this result (H > 100) favors the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity is classified as ‘‘decisive”. Indeed, wheels immediately before being sent to depot for lathing were in the state of ‘heavily defective’.\nMaking use of Eq. (21), the probabilities of damage after TOC are obtained as 100%, that is, the wheels are identified as defective with a very high confidence.\nThe defect detection results for Case 2 are similar to Case 1, and are illustrated in Figs. and 11. As seen in Fig. 11(a)–(c)\nno outlier exists throughout the whole period, but a change-point is identified, of which the time of notification is t ¼ 44 (i.e.,\nTON ¼ 44) and the real time of occurrence is t ¼ 41 (i.e., TOC ¼ 44 4 þ 1 ¼ 41). The result matches well with the actual time point when wheel lathing is inflicted. For the predictions near the change-point, the modified prediction model\n(Fig. 10(b)) offers a better performance than the original model (Fig. 10(a)). As illustrated in Fig. 11(d), all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than the threshold (dotted red line), whereas the values before TOC are within thethreshold line. The values of Bayes factor after TOC are obtained to be higher than 100 (H > 100) and the corresponding probabilities of damage are approximately 100%, which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity\nApart from the accuracy of the proposed approach, the computational efficiency is also of concern. The algorithmic implementation is performed on a Lenovo ThinkCentre M720t desktop (Lenovo, Beijing, China) with Dual Intel Core i7-8700 processor (Intel, California, USA) and 24 GB of memory. The computation times consumed in Case 1 and Case 2 are 4.0109 s and\n3.7704 s respectively. In this sense, it realizes the detection of wheel defects in real time.5. ConclusionsA novel methodology for real-time defect detection of high-speed train wheels using Bayesian forecasting and dynamic linear model (DLM) has been developed and validated in this study. First, the DLM is formulated to approximate the actual\nframework. Afterwards, three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) are elicited for outlier detection and change-point detection. After the change-point has been confirmed, damage assessment is executed by the Bayesian hypothesis testing of the sequential observations before and after the change-point. Due to accommodating the dynamic evolution process and the statistical nature of the method, the proposed approach not only possesses the ability of real-time damage detection, but also enables damage quantification (through classifying the range of Bayes factor) and uncertainty assessment (through calculating the probability of damage). The methodology is illustrated by using the onlinelathing). In the two cases addressed, wheel defects are successfully identified, hence validating the effectiveness of the developed method. The quantitative results about the damage extent and confidence would provide useful information helping to\nmake cost-effective, risk-based decisions with the aim of maintaining the operation safety of high-speed rail.\nDespite the proposed methodology being developed for wheel defect detection of high-speed trains, it can also be applied to low-speed passenger and freight trains as well as extended to SHM for a wide variety of civil infrastructure (e.g., bridges,\nbuildings and tunnels) when vibration signals are available via monitoring. In this study, the second-order polynomial DLM\nis employed to model the stress ranges, which only considers the change of stress range level and trend. However, most longterm SHM data, especially long-term strain monitoring data, are generally contaminated by trend, seasonal (cyclical) and\nregression effects, which require a more complex model. The Bayesian DLM enables the modeling of time-dependent responses of a structure by integrating appropriate components, for instance, the response with cyclical characteristics\ncan be depicted by embedding a seasonal (cyclical) component. Thus, in accordance with the nature of monitoring data,\nan appropriate Bayesian DLM enabling to describe time series data of different features, can be formulated for damage detection of a variety of structures subject to different operational/environmental conditions.Administrative Region, China (Project No. PolyU 152024/17E).

IntroductionHigh-speed rail (HSR) is being developed in Asian and European countries to satisfy the rapidly growing demand for intercity services and to shore up economic growth. The rapid\ngrowth of HSR, however, has posed great challenges regarding operation safety, reliability\nand ride comfort. Irregular wheel defects can induce high-magnitude impact forces hindering safety and ride comfort of HSR and may also cause damage to rail tracks and vehicles.real time. The proposed methodology embraces logics for (i) prognosis, (ii) potential outlier\ndetection, (iii) identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and (iv) quantification of damage extent and uncertainty. Relying on the strain monitoring data acquired from high-speed train bogies, the Bayesian DLM for characterizing the actual stress ranges is established, by which one-step forecast distribution is elicited before proceeding to the\nnext observation. The detection of change-point is executed by comparing the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM) and an alternative model\n(the mean value is shifted by a prescribed offset) to determine which better fits the actual observation. If the comparison results are in favor of the alternative model, it is claimed that a potential change has occurred. Whether such an observation is an outlier or the beginning of a genuine change (change-point), three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum\ncumulative Bayes factor and run length) are performed for further identification.

Rail accidents were occasionally caused by failures such as severe defects or fatigue of railway components. To maintain a good service quality and operation safety, it is paramount to develop\nonline monitoring techniques that not only quickly recognize faults of mission-critical HSR components but also can anticipate of long-term mechanisms and gradual deterioration in performance.\nWheelsets in a high-speed train are physically connected with and controlled by the bogie system which corrects alignment for stable running and reduces the vibration caused by wheel-rail interaction . However, the wheel performance\nprogressively deteriorates in different mechanisms (e.g., wheel flat and wheel polygonization) during the routine operation of a high-speed train . Wheel performance deterioration increases stresses experienced by the bogie system. In addition,\nthe increased stress within bogie frames caused by wheel quality deterioration can be unexpectedly large, thus posing a serious threat to the operation safety of concerned trains. According to the statistics of train accidents caused by failure in\nmechanical components during 2004 to 2007 in the United States, the wheelsets faults are the most cause with a rate of\n44.7% . Therefore, the railway managers are keen to keep wheels in an adequate condition and detect potential failure\nas soon as possible. For railway wheels, there are three different ways of estimating the conditions: physical modeling, statistical modeling and condition monitoring . However, the first two ways are not applicable to in-service\nwheel condition assessment, and in contrast, the third way is most feasible for wheel condition estimation. The monitoring approaches available to wheel defect detection can be divided into in-workshop inspection and in-service detection . The\nlatter provides the real-time data required for maintenance planning, while the former is normally carried out at workshops at fixed intervals.

Such indirect measurements give rise to limited information of the wheel condition while they can monitor all train wheels going by with using only one or a few sensors. According to the type\nof sensors used, wayside detection approaches include strain sensing technology , fiber optic sensing technology ,\nultrasonic technique , vibration technique , acoustic emission , lasers and high-speed cameras . However,\nthe study on data interpretation techniques enabling the extraction of defect-sensitive features is far from sufficient.\nBayesian dynamic linear model (DLM) is an elegant system approach to handling time series data from a Bayesian perspective, which originates from the field of applied statistics and is extensively used in other fields such as economics\nand engineering [25–30]. The Bayesian DLM treats the time series as the output of a dynamic system perturbed by random disturbances. It is suitable for modeling both univariate and multivariate time series, and also for representing the structural changes, non-stationarity and irregular patterns . Unlike the classical time series method which assumes a fixed relationship between the dependent variables (response variables) and the independent variables (regressors), the DLM considers\nthe relationship changes over time and is able to directly capture time series data features, such as trend, seasonality,\nand regression effects. Moreover, the DLM allows for descriptions of temporary or permanent shifts in time series parameters that occur abruptly, which are necessary for outlier and damage detection in structural health monitoring (SHM) paradigms. Recently, Goulet and his collaborator adopted the Bayesian DLM theory in SHM to model the time-dependent\nresponses of structures by breaking them into subcomponents. In the perspective of real-time damage detection, only few studies are available. The first attempt was conducted by Lipowsky et al. with the development of a Bayesian DLM-based\nreal-time detection algorithm to evaluate the performance of a gas turbine using simulated data. Later on, Wang et al.\nand Zhang et al. adopted the above algorithm for detecting high-speed train defects by using real-world monitoring\ndata. In the previous studies, however, the real-time detection algorithm devised possesses only outlier identification and\nchange detection abilities, without the function of damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.context of Bayesian DLM, which incorporates logics for prognosis, potential outlier detection, identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and damage extent and uncertainty quantification. The Bayesian DLM is considered as a tool\nfor time series analysis, while Bayesian forecasting is executed to enable the calculation of one-step ahead forecast distribution. The change-point detection is performed by checking the current observation against the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM for current instant) as well as against an alternative model of which the mean value\nis shifted by a prescribed offset. The detection rule is that if the alternative model better fits the actual observation, a potential change is signaled. To further determine whether such an observation is only an outlier or the beginning of an actual\nchange (change-point), a specific logic is developed by introducing the Bayes factor and the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.\nThe main contributions of this study are the provision of: (i) a formula which not only enables the modeling of actual framework; (ii) three metrics (i.e., the Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) to allow for outlier\nand change-point detection in real-time manner; and (iii) an efficient way for damage extent assessment and uncertainty\nquantification. The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the Bayesian DLM theory and an elaboration of the Bayesian forecasting philosophy. Section 3 presents the defect detection methodology that incorporates logics for\noutlier detection, change-point identification, and damage assessment. In Section 4, two case studies making use of timeseries strain data acquired by fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors affixed on the bogies of an in-service high-speed train are offered to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the proposed methodology. Finally, conclusions are drawn in2. Bayesian DLM and forecastingThe Bayesian DLM is a kind of process-based Bayesian prediction model which provides a flexible way to intuitively capture how processes evolve over time. It consists of two basic equations: an observation (measurement) equation and a system (evolution) equation . The observation (measurement) equation describes the relationship between the observed\nrandom vectors with mean zero and unknown covariance matrices V t and W t. The DLM defined above amounts to treating ht\nrange level at time t, and at represents the stress range change between time t 1 and t. v t is the zero-mean Gaussian random variable representing the error of measurement at moment t. x1t and x2t are both zero-mean Gaussian random variables representing the evolution of DLM from time t 1 to t. In association with the form of DLM in Equation (1), we haveThe Bayesian forecasting philosophy is based on the description of an observed process using its probability density function (PDF). As implied by the name, the Bayesian forecasting approach commences from Bayes’ theorem, hence enabling the calculation of conditional probabilities. The details of using DLM for the recursive one-step ahead forecasting of the (posterior) distribution of monitoring-derived stress ranges under the Bayesian framework are presented as follows\nNote that in Step 4, Atþ1 is the adaptive coefficient which can be viewed as the information tuner. It scales the correction term according to the relative variances of the prior and likelihood, as measured by Rtþ1=Q tþ1 and regressor value Ftþ1. etþ1 is\nthe one-step forward forecast error, the difference between the observed value ytþ1 and its expectation f tþ1. More details\nabout the recursive one-step ahead forecast method can be found in .3. Defect detection methodologyThe proposed defect detection methodology contains three logical processes: outlier detection, change-point detection,\nand damage assessment. By comparing the real-time measurement with the predicted values, the named outlier detection and change-point detection are devised to determine whether the measurement is a single outlier or the first observation of a remarkable change, the former being executed by calculating the Bayes factor, while the latter being based on the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once a change-point is affirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for further damagePotential outlier detection is the first step in the process of the proposed defect detection approach, accomplished by the Bayes factor calculation. Bayes factor is advocated because of its straightforward and natural interpretation of evidence afforded by data. At every time step t, the Bayesian DLM can yield a PDF for the next measurement, labeled as M0. Meanwhile, an artificial alternative model labeled as M1 is defined by shifting the mean of M0 by +h. The underlying idea of outlier\ndetection is to check the current observation against both M0 and M1. For each time step t, the Bayes factor is the ratio of thewhere yt is the measurement at time t and Dt1 refers to the history information up to time t 1. In the case of Gaussianwhere h is the shift value; yt is the observation value; f t and rt are the mean and standard deviation of the forecasting distribution for observation at time t. A Bayes factor H ¼ 1 indicates that the probability of the observation derived from model M1 is identical to the probability of that derived from Model M0. For better quantitative comparison between any two models, Jeffreys suggested interpreting the Bayes factor as a scale of evidence and provided descriptive statements although\nthe partitions are somewhat arbitrary. According to his suggestion, a Bayes factor can be divided into several intervals for assessing the significance of discrimination: 1 < H < 3 is ‘barely worth mentioning’, 3 < H < 10 is ‘substantial’,\n10 < H < 30 is ‘strong’, 30 < H < 100 is ‘very strong’, and H > 100 is ‘decisive’. In this study, Hmin ¼ 10 is set as a threshold\nAfter the confirmation of Hmin and h, an uncertainty limit (ucl) can be procured by the following equationFor instance, when the confidence level a and threshold of Bayes factor Hmin are set as 90% and 10 respectively, the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt. Thus, an observation is diagnosed as an outlier if its deviation from the mean value of M0 is larger\nWith the Bayes factor defined in Equation (9), only outliers with a positive deviation can be detected. To enable the outliers with negative deviation to be detected as well, a second Bayes factor is defined asIn the automatic monitoring process, both the Bayes factors H1;t and H2;t should be examined in parallel to enable thebehavior, rather than judgments based on long past performances. Change-point is an abrupt variation in time series data,\nrepresenting a transition that occurs between states. Change-point detection aims to detect abrupt change in the generative\nprocess of sequential data. It is assumed that a sequence of observations y1; ; yT could be divided into several nonoverlapping partitions, e.g. dataset j 1, dataset j, and dataset j + 1 as shown in Fig. 2. The delineations between partitions\nare known as change-points (e.g. TOC j 1 and TOC j); the goal of change-point detection is the determination of where the\nboundary of two adjacent partitions is located in a sequence of observations. Change-point detection approaches can be classified into offline and online methods. The former needs to observe the whole sequential observations before aiming to make\ninference on the generative process of the sequence [37–40], wheras the latter aims to update the inference at each time step\nwith the newly acquired measurements from the sequence [41–43]. In particular, the Bayesian online change-point detection methods are based on computing the probability distribution of the run length.differentiate between the single-point outlier and the beginning of a continual change. To overcome this problem, cumulative Bayes factor (local Bayes factors) is recommended to detect change-point(s) in the sequence of observations, by definingwhere lmax is the maximum number of Bayes factors taken into account. Unlike Bayes factor with implicitly no historical influence in the judgement, the consecutive Bayes factors collect evidence of change over a series of observation (from time\net al. . Akin to the Bayes factor threshold for outlier detection, the threshold of maximal cumulative Bayes factors is set as Lmin ¼ 10. If the conditions Lt > Lmin and lt > lmin occur simultaneously, an alarm of change is immediately issued at time t\n(time of notification, TON). The real time of occurrence (TOC) is (t lt þ 1), that is, TOC =t lt þ 1.Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is performed to assess damage extent and quantify the\nassociated uncertainty. The proposed approach directly quantifies the likelihoods of two scenarios (e.g., the sequential observations before and after the change-point), that is, ‘‘no fault” and ‘‘fault”, and the yielded results are easy to interpret. An\nadditional merit of the proposed approach is its ability to quantify the uncertainty in damage detection. Assume that the observed sequential data can be divided into two non-overlapping partitions, the first of which is regarded as healthy\nof the observations. Thus, the damage detection problem becomes the test of H0 : l ¼ l0 versus H1 : l–l0 with\nWith the above, damage detection can be achieved by means of Bayes factor which is defined as the ratio of the probability of observations given the alternate hypothesis to the probability of observations given the null hypothesiswhere D ¼ yf 1; ; yng refers to the observed data. It is proven to bewhere refers to the mean of the observed data fy1; ; yng. If no prior information is available, the initial mean and variance can be set as q ¼ l0 and s ¼ r 0 [][. The two assumptions take the prior mean and variance in the alternative hypothesis as]where z ¼ pfn **f** i ffi l0 0 [ At each time step (i.e.,][ n][=1), the Bayes factor][ B][ is larger for the larger values of][ z][j j][, which is reasonable]and easy to interpret. The logarithm of the Bayes factor, for convenience of comparison among a larger of values, is derived asIf the Bayes factor B10 is larger than 1, the implication is that the observed data provide evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis H1 (i.e., the structure is damaged). Otherwise, the observed data are judged to support the null hypothesis H0 (i.e.,\nthe structure is healthy). As with the previous threshold, B10 10 is set as a threshold for damage indication.\nIntegrating together the outlier detection, change-point detection and damage assessment, the implementation procedures of the proposed methodology are shown in Fig. 3. Beginning at time t, the single Bayes factor is firstly evaluated to\njudge whether yt is an outlier. If not, the maximum cumulative Bayes factor Lt and run length lt for change-point detection are calculated. Once a change-point is detected, the intervention is carried out by resetting the time to the time of occurrence\n(i.e., TOC = t lt þ 1) and by adjusting the mean value of M0 to the observation yt (i.e., f t ¼ yt), and the subsequent analysis\nwill then be started at TOC. Meanwhile, Bayesian hypothesis testing is executed for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification from the current TOC to the next TOC.4. Application to in-service monitoring data of high-speed trainAn onboard monitoring system has been designed and implemented on an in-service high-speed passenger train running on the Lanzhou-Urumqi High-Speed Railway (LUHSR) in China . As shown in Fig. 4, the monitoring system is composed\nof a total of 52 FBG strain sensors, 4 FBG temperature sensors, 11 accelerometers (tri-axial) and 1 noise sensor deployed on both motor and trailer bogies. Also, one tri-axial FBG accelerometer, one video camera and two GPS sensors are installed inside a train carriage. As the present work is focused on the real-time detection of potentially defective wheels by using strain monitoring data from bogies, only the deployment of strain sensors is concerned. The strain sensors are mounted\non 4 measurement zones of the bogies: (i) the zone with the action of high loads; (ii) the stress transmission zone; (iii)\nthe zone with high responses predicted by finite element analysis; and (iv) welded joints. FBG strain (and temperature) sensors are deployed and attached to the surface of the train bogie with industrial glue and tapes, and connected to the interrogator (data logger) with laptop inside the train carriage through optical fiber cables.\nThe data utilized in this study were obtained from a monitoring schedule spanning 18 days as shown in Table 1. The total length of the LUHSR between Lanzhou and Urumqi is 1777 km. In the trip from Lanzhou to Urumqi, the high-speed train\nstops by 14 stations and travels cross 13 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 13th); in trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou, the high-speed train stops by 15 stations and travels cross 14 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 14th). During the monitoring\nperiod, the train operated at its normal speed around 200–250 km/h. The sampling rate for all the sensors was set at 5000\nSince the train wheels were lathed (lathing is a process to make wheels perfectly rounded) during the monitoring period,\nthe recorded data contain information in line with two different states (before lathing and after lathing). The wheels can be considered as potentially unhealthy (defective) before lathing and as healthy after lathing. To verify the effectiveness of theproposed real-time defect detection methodology, the strain monitoring data obtained from the bogies before and afterThe train’s dynamic responses may be influenced by different subgrade conditions of the railroad, such as ground, tunnel,\nand bridge. To eliminate the effects of different railroad conditions, the strain data recorded from the same railroad sectionbefore and after lathing, are used in each scenario. In addition, the passenger loads in different trips are deemed statistically identical and the speed of train is assumed to be constant as in normal operation. Without loss of generality, the monitoring\ndata respectively obtained from two typical railroad sections (1st and 14th) in the trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou are chosen to illustrate the proposed real-time defect detection methodology, which are from the strain gauge (MS3-7) deployed at the For the sake of brevity, the monitoring data collected from the 1st railroad section are denoted as Case 1, while those from the 14th railroad section are denoted as Case 2. Firstly, the measured strain is converted to stress for the subsequent stress\nrange calculation. For the strain gauges mounted on the steel surface, the conversion of the measured strain to stress is made by rs ¼ Ee, where E is the elasticity modulus of steel and e is the strain after eliminating the effect of varying temperatures.where em is the measured strain, T m is the measured temperature in the vicinity of the strain sensor, T 0 is the temperature at\nthe installation, and a1 is a constant coefficient. In our case, the original temperature is 4, i.e., T 0 ¼ 4. The results of temperature compensation are demonstrated in Fig. 5. It is obvious that the trend in strain responses caused by temperature\nAfterwards, the stress ranges are extracted from the monitoring-derived stress data by the application of the rainflow\ncounting algorithm. From each stress cycle, the stress range Sa is obtained by calculating the difference between the maximum stress rmax and the minimum stress rmin measured in that stress cycle, i.e., Sa ¼ rmax rmin. More details on the stress ranges extraction are given in . The stress ranges with amplitudes lower than 1 MPa need to be culled because the majority are caused by noise. To decrease the uncertainty arising from the measurement facilities, the average stress ranges for\nevery ten minutes are used as the target quantities. Due to the different lengths of the two selected railroad sections (1st and 14th), the traveling time of the train in each section is also different. This results in different data lengths. The data\nlengths of the average stress ranges in Case 1 and Case 2 are 110 and 90, respectively. Figs. and 7 show the original measured strain responses before and after lathing in Case 1 and Case 2, respectively.Following the implementation procedures mentioned before, the defect detection results for Case 1 are demonstrated in\nFigs. and 9. Fig. 8(a) shows the average stress range (red point) together with 1-step ahead prediction (blue solid line) and\nthe corresponding 90% prediction interval (grey shadow). It is observed that, although some observations at the time interval t 2 fall outside the 90% prediction interval, only the Bayes factor at time t ¼ 55 exceeds the established threshold of Hmin ¼ 10 as shown in Fig. 9(a). It is thus judged as an outlier (marked as h). The reason is that because when applying the proposed approach, the shift parameter is set as h ¼ 1:645rt, resulting in the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt while the other\nfour observations are still within the uncertainty limit. On the other hand, Fig. 9(b)–(c) shows the results of the maximum cumulative Bayes factor and the corresponding run length for change detection. It is seen that the maximum cumulative\nBayes factor values at time instants t ¼ 56; 57 and 58 are larger than the threshold of Lmin ¼ 10, while merely the run length at instant t ¼ 58 surpasses the threshold of lmin ¼ 4. Apparently, this observation at time t ¼ 58 fulfills the conditions of change-point detection causing an alarm to be issued (i.e., TON ¼ 58). The identified real occurrence time of change-point is t ¼ 55 (i.e., TOC ¼ 58 4 þ 1 ¼ 55), which coincides well with the actual time point of lathing the wheels. In accordance\nwith the real-time identification of change-point occurrence, the prediction model is refined by altering the guessed mean\nvalue at TOC, as shown in Fig. 8(b). The predictions near TOC in the refined model obviously agree well with the actual observations, thus offering a better prediction performance than that of the original model.\nThe results of defect detection by means of Bayesian hypothesis testing are illustrated in Fig. 9(d). The discrimination between ‘‘healthy” and ‘‘defective” is quantified by the logarithm value of Bayes factor. It is seen from Fig. 9(d) that the vast\nmajority of logarithm values of Bayes factor before TOC are nearly zero and below the threshold level (dotted red line), which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘healthy state” (no defect). This is consistent with the actual health condition and thus validatesthe capability of the Bayesian hypothesis testing. On the contrary, all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than 2, meaning that the corresponding Bayes factor values exceed 100. According to the classification of Bayes factor stipulated in Sub-section 3.1, this result (H > 100) favors the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity is classified as ‘‘decisive”. Indeed, wheels immediately before being sent to depot for lathing were in the state of ‘heavily defective’.\nMaking use of Eq. (21), the probabilities of damage after TOC are obtained as 100%, that is, the wheels are identified as defective with a very high confidence.\nThe defect detection results for Case 2 are similar to Case 1, and are illustrated in Figs. and 11. As seen in Fig. 11(a)–(c)\nno outlier exists throughout the whole period, but a change-point is identified, of which the time of notification is t ¼ 44 (i.e.,\nTON ¼ 44) and the real time of occurrence is t ¼ 41 (i.e., TOC ¼ 44 4 þ 1 ¼ 41). The result matches well with the actual time point when wheel lathing is inflicted. For the predictions near the change-point, the modified prediction model\n(Fig. 10(b)) offers a better performance than the original model (Fig. 10(a)). As illustrated in Fig. 11(d), all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than the threshold (dotted red line), whereas the values before TOC are within thethreshold line. The values of Bayes factor after TOC are obtained to be higher than 100 (H > 100) and the corresponding probabilities of damage are approximately 100%, which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity\nApart from the accuracy of the proposed approach, the computational efficiency is also of concern. The algorithmic implementation is performed on a Lenovo ThinkCentre M720t desktop (Lenovo, Beijing, China) with Dual Intel Core i7-8700 processor (Intel, California, USA) and 24 GB of memory. The computation times consumed in Case 1 and Case 2 are 4.0109 s and\n3.7704 s respectively. In this sense, it realizes the detection of wheel defects in real time.5. ConclusionsA novel methodology for real-time defect detection of high-speed train wheels using Bayesian forecasting and dynamic linear model (DLM) has been developed and validated in this study. First, the DLM is formulated to approximate the actual\nframework. Afterwards, three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) are elicited for outlier detection and change-point detection. After the change-point has been confirmed, damage assessment is executed by the Bayesian hypothesis testing of the sequential observations before and after the change-point. Due to accommodating the dynamic evolution process and the statistical nature of the method, the proposed approach not only possesses the ability of real-time damage detection, but also enables damage quantification (through classifying the range of Bayes factor) and uncertainty assessment (through calculating the probability of damage). The methodology is illustrated by using the onlinelathing). In the two cases addressed, wheel defects are successfully identified, hence validating the effectiveness of the developed method. The quantitative results about the damage extent and confidence would provide useful information helping to\nmake cost-effective, risk-based decisions with the aim of maintaining the operation safety of high-speed rail.\nDespite the proposed methodology being developed for wheel defect detection of high-speed trains, it can also be applied to low-speed passenger and freight trains as well as extended to SHM for a wide variety of civil infrastructure (e.g., bridges,\nbuildings and tunnels) when vibration signals are available via monitoring. In this study, the second-order polynomial DLM\nis employed to model the stress ranges, which only considers the change of stress range level and trend. However, most longterm SHM data, especially long-term strain monitoring data, are generally contaminated by trend, seasonal (cyclical) and\nregression effects, which require a more complex model. The Bayesian DLM enables the modeling of time-dependent responses of a structure by integrating appropriate components, for instance, the response with cyclical characteristics\ncan be depicted by embedding a seasonal (cyclical) component. Thus, in accordance with the nature of monitoring data,\nan appropriate Bayesian DLM enabling to describe time series data of different features, can be formulated for damage detection of a variety of structures subject to different operational/environmental conditions.Administrative Region, China (Project No. PolyU 152024/17E).

The rapid\ngrowth of HSR, however, has posed great challenges regarding operation safety, reliability\nand ride comfort.

The proposed methodology embraces logics for (i) prognosis, (ii) potential outlier\ndetection, (iii) identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and (iv) quantification of damage extent and uncertainty. Relying on the strain monitoring data acquired from high-speed train bogies, the Bayesian DLM for characterizing the actual stress ranges is established, by which one-step forecast distribution is elicited before proceeding to the\nnext observation.

Rail accidents were occasionally caused by failures such as severe defects or fatigue of railway components. To maintain a good service quality and operation safety, it is paramount to develop\nonline monitoring techniques that not only quickly recognize faults of mission-critical HSR components but also can anticipate of long-term mechanisms and gradual deterioration in performance.\nWheelsets in a high-speed train are physically connected with and controlled by the bogie system which corrects alignment for stable running and reduces the vibration caused by wheel-rail interaction . However, the wheel performance\nprogressively deteriorates in different mechanisms (e.g., wheel flat and wheel polygonization) during the routine operation of a high-speed train . Wheel performance deterioration increases stresses experienced by the bogie system. In addition,\nthe increased stress within bogie frames caused by wheel quality deterioration can be unexpectedly large, thus posing a serious threat to the operation safety of concerned trains. According to the statistics of train accidents caused by failure in\nmechanical components during 2004 to 2007 in the United States, the wheelsets faults are the most cause with a rate of\n44.7% . Therefore, the railway managers are keen to keep wheels in an adequate condition and detect potential failure\nas soon as possible. For railway wheels, there are three different ways of estimating the conditions: physical modeling, statistical modeling and condition monitoring . However, the first two ways are not applicable to in-service\nwheel condition assessment, and in contrast, the third way is most feasible for wheel condition estimation. The monitoring approaches available to wheel defect detection can be divided into in-workshop inspection and in-service detection . The\nlatter provides the real-time data required for maintenance planning, while the former is normally carried out at workshops at fixed intervals. The commonly used in-workshop methods for wheel defect inspection include the ultrasonic techniques, infrared camera and magnetic methods .

It is suitable for modeling both univariate and multivariate time series, and also for representing the structural changes, non-stationarity and irregular patterns . Unlike the classical time series method which assumes a fixed relationship between the dependent variables (response variables) and the independent variables (regressors), the DLM considers\nthe relationship changes over time and is able to directly capture time series data features, such as trend, seasonality,\nand regression effects. Moreover, the DLM allows for descriptions of temporary or permanent shifts in time series parameters that occur abruptly, which are necessary for outlier and damage detection in structural health monitoring (SHM) paradigms. Recently, Goulet and his collaborator adopted the Bayesian DLM theory in SHM to model the time-dependent\nresponses of structures by breaking them into subcomponents. In the perspective of real-time damage detection, only few studies are available. The first attempt was conducted by Lipowsky et al. with the development of a Bayesian DLM-based\nreal-time detection algorithm to evaluate the performance of a gas turbine using simulated data. Later on, Wang et al.\nand Zhang et al. adopted the above algorithm for detecting high-speed train defects by using real-world monitoring\ndata. In the previous studies, however, the real-time detection algorithm devised possesses only outlier identification and\nchange detection abilities, without the function of damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.context of Bayesian DLM, which incorporates logics for prognosis, potential outlier detection, identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and damage extent and uncertainty quantification. The Bayesian DLM is considered as a tool\nfor time series analysis, while Bayesian forecasting is executed to enable the calculation of one-step ahead forecast distribution. The change-point detection is performed by checking the current observation against the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM for current instant) as well as against an alternative model of which the mean value\nis shifted by a prescribed offset. The detection rule is that if the alternative model better fits the actual observation, a potential change is signaled. To further determine whether such an observation is only an outlier or the beginning of an actual\nchange (change-point), a specific logic is developed by introducing the Bayes factor and the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.\nThe main contributions of this study are the provision of: (i) a formula which not only enables the modeling of actual framework; (ii) three metrics (i.e., the Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) to allow for outlier\nand change-point detection in real-time manner; and (iii) an efficient way for damage extent assessment and uncertainty\nquantification. The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the Bayesian DLM theory and an elaboration of the Bayesian forecasting philosophy. Section 3 presents the defect detection methodology that incorporates logics for\noutlier detection, change-point identification, and damage assessment. In Section 4, two case studies making use of timeseries strain data acquired by fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors affixed on the bogies of an in-service high-speed train are offered to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the proposed methodology. Finally, conclusions are drawn in2. Bayesian DLM and forecastingThe Bayesian DLM is a kind of process-based Bayesian prediction model which provides a flexible way to intuitively capture how processes evolve over time. It consists of two basic equations: an observation (measurement) equation and a system (evolution) equation . The observation (measurement) equation describes the relationship between the observed\nrandom vectors with mean zero and unknown covariance matrices V t and W t. The DLM defined above amounts to treating ht\nrange level at time t, and at represents the stress range change between time t 1 and t. v t is the zero-mean Gaussian random variable representing the error of measurement at moment t. x1t and x2t are both zero-mean Gaussian random variables representing the evolution of DLM from time t 1 to t. In association with the form of DLM in Equation (1), we haveThe Bayesian forecasting philosophy is based on the description of an observed process using its probability density function (PDF). As implied by the name, the Bayesian forecasting approach commences from Bayes’ theorem, hence enabling the calculation of conditional probabilities. The details of using DLM for the recursive one-step ahead forecasting of the (posterior) distribution of monitoring-derived stress ranges under the Bayesian framework are presented as follows\nNote that in Step 4, Atþ1 is the adaptive coefficient which can be viewed as the information tuner. It scales the correction term according to the relative variances of the prior and likelihood, as measured by Rtþ1=Q tþ1 and regressor value Ftþ1. etþ1 is\nthe one-step forward forecast error, the difference between the observed value ytþ1 and its expectation f tþ1. More details\nabout the recursive one-step ahead forecast method can be found in .3. Defect detection methodologyThe proposed defect detection methodology contains three logical processes: outlier detection, change-point detection,\nand damage assessment. By comparing the real-time measurement with the predicted values, the named outlier detection and change-point detection are devised to determine whether the measurement is a single outlier or the first observation of a remarkable change, the former being executed by calculating the Bayes factor, while the latter being based on the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once a change-point is affirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for further damagePotential outlier detection is the first step in the process of the proposed defect detection approach, accomplished by the Bayes factor calculation. Bayes factor is advocated because of its straightforward and natural interpretation of evidence afforded by data. At every time step t, the Bayesian DLM can yield a PDF for the next measurement, labeled as M0. Meanwhile, an artificial alternative model labeled as M1 is defined by shifting the mean of M0 by +h. The underlying idea of outlier\ndetection is to check the current observation against both M0 and M1. For each time step t, the Bayes factor is the ratio of thewhere yt is the measurement at time t and Dt1 refers to the history information up to time t 1. In the case of Gaussianwhere h is the shift value; yt is the observation value; f t and rt are the mean and standard deviation of the forecasting distribution for observation at time t. A Bayes factor H ¼ 1 indicates that the probability of the observation derived from model M1 is identical to the probability of that derived from Model M0. For better quantitative comparison between any two models, Jeffreys suggested interpreting the Bayes factor as a scale of evidence and provided descriptive statements although\nthe partitions are somewhat arbitrary. According to his suggestion, a Bayes factor can be divided into several intervals for assessing the significance of discrimination: 1 < H < 3 is ‘barely worth mentioning’, 3 < H < 10 is ‘substantial’,\n10 < H < 30 is ‘strong’, 30 < H < 100 is ‘very strong’, and H > 100 is ‘decisive’. In this study, Hmin ¼ 10 is set as a threshold\nAfter the confirmation of Hmin and h, an uncertainty limit (ucl) can be procured by the following equationFor instance, when the confidence level a and threshold of Bayes factor Hmin are set as 90% and 10 respectively, the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt. Thus, an observation is diagnosed as an outlier if its deviation from the mean value of M0 is larger\nWith the Bayes factor defined in Equation (9), only outliers with a positive deviation can be detected. To enable the outliers with negative deviation to be detected as well, a second Bayes factor is defined asIn the automatic monitoring process, both the Bayes factors H1;t and H2;t should be examined in parallel to enable thebehavior, rather than judgments based on long past performances. Change-point is an abrupt variation in time series data,\nrepresenting a transition that occurs between states. Change-point detection aims to detect abrupt change in the generative\nprocess of sequential data. It is assumed that a sequence of observations y1; ; yT could be divided into several nonoverlapping partitions, e.g. dataset j 1, dataset j, and dataset j + 1 as shown in Fig. 2. The delineations between partitions\nare known as change-points (e.g. TOC j 1 and TOC j); the goal of change-point detection is the determination of where the\nboundary of two adjacent partitions is located in a sequence of observations. Change-point detection approaches can be classified into offline and online methods. The former needs to observe the whole sequential observations before aiming to make\ninference on the generative process of the sequence [37–40], wheras the latter aims to update the inference at each time step\nwith the newly acquired measurements from the sequence [41–43]. In particular, the Bayesian online change-point detection methods are based on computing the probability distribution of the run length.differentiate between the single-point outlier and the beginning of a continual change. To overcome this problem, cumulative Bayes factor (local Bayes factors) is recommended to detect change-point(s) in the sequence of observations, by definingwhere lmax is the maximum number of Bayes factors taken into account. Unlike Bayes factor with implicitly no historical influence in the judgement, the consecutive Bayes factors collect evidence of change over a series of observation (from time\net al. . Akin to the Bayes factor threshold for outlier detection, the threshold of maximal cumulative Bayes factors is set as Lmin ¼ 10. If the conditions Lt > Lmin and lt > lmin occur simultaneously, an alarm of change is immediately issued at time t\n(time of notification, TON). The real time of occurrence (TOC) is (t lt þ 1), that is, TOC =t lt þ 1.Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is performed to assess damage extent and quantify the\nassociated uncertainty. The proposed approach directly quantifies the likelihoods of two scenarios (e.g., the sequential observations before and after the change-point), that is, ‘‘no fault” and ‘‘fault”, and the yielded results are easy to interpret. An\nadditional merit of the proposed approach is its ability to quantify the uncertainty in damage detection. Assume that the observed sequential data can be divided into two non-overlapping partitions, the first of which is regarded as healthy\nof the observations. Thus, the damage detection problem becomes the test of H0 : l ¼ l0 versus H1 : l–l0 with\nWith the above, damage detection can be achieved by means of Bayes factor which is defined as the ratio of the probability of observations given the alternate hypothesis to the probability of observations given the null hypothesiswhere D ¼ yf 1; ; yng refers to the observed data. It is proven to bewhere refers to the mean of the observed data fy1; ; yng. If no prior information is available, the initial mean and variance can be set as q ¼ l0 and s ¼ r 0 [][. The two assumptions take the prior mean and variance in the alternative hypothesis as]where z ¼ pfn **f** i ffi l0 0 [ At each time step (i.e.,][ n][=1), the Bayes factor][ B][ is larger for the larger values of][ z][j j][, which is reasonable]and easy to interpret. The logarithm of the Bayes factor, for convenience of comparison among a larger of values, is derived asIf the Bayes factor B10 is larger than 1, the implication is that the observed data provide evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis H1 (i.e., the structure is damaged). Otherwise, the observed data are judged to support the null hypothesis H0 (i.e.,\nthe structure is healthy). As with the previous threshold, B10 10 is set as a threshold for damage indication.\nIntegrating together the outlier detection, change-point detection and damage assessment, the implementation procedures of the proposed methodology are shown in Fig. 3. Beginning at time t, the single Bayes factor is firstly evaluated to\njudge whether yt is an outlier. If not, the maximum cumulative Bayes factor Lt and run length lt for change-point detection are calculated. Once a change-point is detected, the intervention is carried out by resetting the time to the time of occurrence\n(i.e., TOC = t lt þ 1) and by adjusting the mean value of M0 to the observation yt (i.e., f t ¼ yt), and the subsequent analysis\nwill then be started at TOC. Meanwhile, Bayesian hypothesis testing is executed for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification from the current TOC to the next TOC.4. Application to in-service monitoring data of high-speed trainAn onboard monitoring system has been designed and implemented on an in-service high-speed passenger train running on the Lanzhou-Urumqi High-Speed Railway (LUHSR) in China . As shown in Fig. 4, the monitoring system is composed\nof a total of 52 FBG strain sensors, 4 FBG temperature sensors, 11 accelerometers (tri-axial) and 1 noise sensor deployed on both motor and trailer bogies. Also, one tri-axial FBG accelerometer, one video camera and two GPS sensors are installed inside a train carriage. As the present work is focused on the real-time detection of potentially defective wheels by using strain monitoring data from bogies, only the deployment of strain sensors is concerned. The strain sensors are mounted\non 4 measurement zones of the bogies: (i) the zone with the action of high loads; (ii) the stress transmission zone; (iii)\nthe zone with high responses predicted by finite element analysis; and (iv) welded joints. FBG strain (and temperature) sensors are deployed and attached to the surface of the train bogie with industrial glue and tapes, and connected to the interrogator (data logger) with laptop inside the train carriage through optical fiber cables.\nThe data utilized in this study were obtained from a monitoring schedule spanning 18 days as shown in Table 1. The total length of the LUHSR between Lanzhou and Urumqi is 1777 km. In the trip from Lanzhou to Urumqi, the high-speed train\nstops by 14 stations and travels cross 13 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 13th); in trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou, the high-speed train stops by 15 stations and travels cross 14 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 14th). During the monitoring\nperiod, the train operated at its normal speed around 200–250 km/h. The sampling rate for all the sensors was set at 5000\nSince the train wheels were lathed (lathing is a process to make wheels perfectly rounded) during the monitoring period,\nthe recorded data contain information in line with two different states (before lathing and after lathing). The wheels can be considered as potentially unhealthy (defective) before lathing and as healthy after lathing. To verify the effectiveness of theproposed real-time defect detection methodology, the strain monitoring data obtained from the bogies before and afterThe train’s dynamic responses may be influenced by different subgrade conditions of the railroad, such as ground, tunnel,\nand bridge. To eliminate the effects of different railroad conditions, the strain data recorded from the same railroad sectionbefore and after lathing, are used in each scenario. In addition, the passenger loads in different trips are deemed statistically identical and the speed of train is assumed to be constant as in normal operation. Without loss of generality, the monitoring\ndata respectively obtained from two typical railroad sections (1st and 14th) in the trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou are chosen to illustrate the proposed real-time defect detection methodology, which are from the strain gauge (MS3-7) deployed at the For the sake of brevity, the monitoring data collected from the 1st railroad section are denoted as Case 1, while those from the 14th railroad section are denoted as Case 2. Firstly, the measured strain is converted to stress for the subsequent stress\nrange calculation. For the strain gauges mounted on the steel surface, the conversion of the measured strain to stress is made by rs ¼ Ee, where E is the elasticity modulus of steel and e is the strain after eliminating the effect of varying temperatures.where em is the measured strain, T m is the measured temperature in the vicinity of the strain sensor, T 0 is the temperature at\nthe installation, and a1 is a constant coefficient. In our case, the original temperature is 4, i.e., T 0 ¼ 4. The results of temperature compensation are demonstrated in Fig. 5. It is obvious that the trend in strain responses caused by temperature\nAfterwards, the stress ranges are extracted from the monitoring-derived stress data by the application of the rainflow\ncounting algorithm. From each stress cycle, the stress range Sa is obtained by calculating the difference between the maximum stress rmax and the minimum stress rmin measured in that stress cycle, i.e., Sa ¼ rmax rmin. More details on the stress ranges extraction are given in . The stress ranges with amplitudes lower than 1 MPa need to be culled because the majority are caused by noise. To decrease the uncertainty arising from the measurement facilities, the average stress ranges for\nevery ten minutes are used as the target quantities. Due to the different lengths of the two selected railroad sections (1st and 14th), the traveling time of the train in each section is also different. This results in different data lengths. The data\nlengths of the average stress ranges in Case 1 and Case 2 are 110 and 90, respectively. Figs. and 7 show the original measured strain responses before and after lathing in Case 1 and Case 2, respectively.Following the implementation procedures mentioned before, the defect detection results for Case 1 are demonstrated in\nFigs. and 9. Fig. 8(a) shows the average stress range (red point) together with 1-step ahead prediction (blue solid line) and\nthe corresponding 90% prediction interval (grey shadow). It is observed that, although some observations at the time interval t 2 fall outside the 90% prediction interval, only the Bayes factor at time t ¼ 55 exceeds the established threshold of Hmin ¼ 10 as shown in Fig. 9(a). It is thus judged as an outlier (marked as h). The reason is that because when applying the proposed approach, the shift parameter is set as h ¼ 1:645rt, resulting in the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt while the other\nfour observations are still within the uncertainty limit. On the other hand, Fig. 9(b)–(c) shows the results of the maximum cumulative Bayes factor and the corresponding run length for change detection. It is seen that the maximum cumulative\nBayes factor values at time instants t ¼ 56; 57 and 58 are larger than the threshold of Lmin ¼ 10, while merely the run length at instant t ¼ 58 surpasses the threshold of lmin ¼ 4. Apparently, this observation at time t ¼ 58 fulfills the conditions of change-point detection causing an alarm to be issued (i.e., TON ¼ 58). The identified real occurrence time of change-point is t ¼ 55 (i.e., TOC ¼ 58 4 þ 1 ¼ 55), which coincides well with the actual time point of lathing the wheels. In accordance\nwith the real-time identification of change-point occurrence, the prediction model is refined by altering the guessed mean\nvalue at TOC, as shown in Fig. 8(b). The predictions near TOC in the refined model obviously agree well with the actual observations, thus offering a better prediction performance than that of the original model.\nThe results of defect detection by means of Bayesian hypothesis testing are illustrated in Fig. 9(d). The discrimination between ‘‘healthy” and ‘‘defective” is quantified by the logarithm value of Bayes factor. It is seen from Fig. 9(d) that the vast\nmajority of logarithm values of Bayes factor before TOC are nearly zero and below the threshold level (dotted red line), which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘healthy state” (no defect). This is consistent with the actual health condition and thus validatesthe capability of the Bayesian hypothesis testing. On the contrary, all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than 2, meaning that the corresponding Bayes factor values exceed 100. According to the classification of Bayes factor stipulated in Sub-section 3.1, this result (H > 100) favors the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity is classified as ‘‘decisive”. Indeed, wheels immediately before being sent to depot for lathing were in the state of ‘heavily defective’.\nMaking use of Eq. (21), the probabilities of damage after TOC are obtained as 100%, that is, the wheels are identified as defective with a very high confidence.\nThe defect detection results for Case 2 are similar to Case 1, and are illustrated in Figs. and 11. As seen in Fig. 11(a)–(c)\nno outlier exists throughout the whole period, but a change-point is identified, of which the time of notification is t ¼ 44 (i.e.,\nTON ¼ 44) and the real time of occurrence is t ¼ 41 (i.e., TOC ¼ 44 4 þ 1 ¼ 41). The result matches well with the actual time point when wheel lathing is inflicted. For the predictions near the change-point, the modified prediction model\n(Fig. 10(b)) offers a better performance than the original model (Fig. 10(a)). As illustrated in Fig. 11(d), all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than the threshold (dotted red line), whereas the values before TOC are within thethreshold line. The values of Bayes factor after TOC are obtained to be higher than 100 (H > 100) and the corresponding probabilities of damage are approximately 100%, which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity\nApart from the accuracy of the proposed approach, the computational efficiency is also of concern. The algorithmic implementation is performed on a Lenovo ThinkCentre M720t desktop (Lenovo, Beijing, China) with Dual Intel Core i7-8700 processor (Intel, California, USA) and 24 GB of memory. The computation times consumed in Case 1 and Case 2 are 4.0109 s and\n3.7704 s respectively. In this sense, it realizes the detection of wheel defects in real time.5. ConclusionsA novel methodology for real-time defect detection of high-speed train wheels using Bayesian forecasting and dynamic linear model (DLM) has been developed and validated in this study. First, the DLM is formulated to approximate the actual\nframework. Afterwards, three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) are elicited for outlier detection and change-point detection. After the change-point has been confirmed, damage assessment is executed by the Bayesian hypothesis testing of the sequential observations before and after the change-point. Due to accommodating the dynamic evolution process and the statistical nature of the method, the proposed approach not only possesses the ability of real-time damage detection, but also enables damage quantification (through classifying the range of Bayes factor) and uncertainty assessment (through calculating the probability of damage). The methodology is illustrated by using the onlinelathing). In the two cases addressed, wheel defects are successfully identified, hence validating the effectiveness of the developed method. The quantitative results about the damage extent and confidence would provide useful information helping to\nmake cost-effective, risk-based decisions with the aim of maintaining the operation safety of high-speed rail.\nDespite the proposed methodology being developed for wheel defect detection of high-speed trains, it can also be applied to low-speed passenger and freight trains as well as extended to SHM for a wide variety of civil infrastructure (e.g., bridges,\nbuildings and tunnels) when vibration signals are available via monitoring. In this study, the second-order polynomial DLM\nis employed to model the stress ranges, which only considers the change of stress range level and trend. However, most longterm SHM data, especially long-term strain monitoring data, are generally contaminated by trend, seasonal (cyclical) and\nregression effects, which require a more complex model. The Bayesian DLM enables the modeling of time-dependent responses of a structure by integrating appropriate components, for instance, the response with cyclical characteristics\ncan be depicted by embedding a seasonal (cyclical) component. Thus, in accordance with the nature of monitoring data,\nan appropriate Bayesian DLM enabling to describe time series data of different features, can be formulated for damage detection of a variety of structures subject to different operational/environmental conditions.Administrative Region, China (Project No. PolyU 152024/17E).

The rapid\ngrowth of HSR, however, has posed great challenges regarding operation safety, reliability\nand ride comfort.

Rail accidents were occasionally caused by failures such as severe defects or fatigue of railway components. To maintain a good service quality and operation safety, it is paramount to develop\nonline monitoring techniques that not only quickly recognize faults of mission-critical HSR components but also can anticipate of long-term mechanisms and gradual deterioration in performance.\nWheelsets in a high-speed train are physically connected with and controlled by the bogie system which corrects alignment for stable running and reduces the vibration caused by wheel-rail interaction . However, the wheel performance\nprogressively deteriorates in different mechanisms (e.g., wheel flat and wheel polygonization) during the routine operation of a high-speed train . Wheel performance deterioration increases stresses experienced by the bogie system. In addition,\nthe increased stress within bogie frames caused by wheel quality deterioration can be unexpectedly large, thus posing a serious threat to the operation safety of concerned trains. According to the statistics of train accidents caused by failure in\nmechanical components during 2004 to 2007 in the United States, the wheelsets faults are the most cause with a rate of\n44.7% . Therefore, the railway managers are keen to keep wheels in an adequate condition and detect potential failure\nas soon as possible. For railway wheels, there are three different ways of estimating the conditions: physical modeling, statistical modeling and condition monitoring . However, the first two ways are not applicable to in-service\nwheel condition assessment, and in contrast, the third way is most feasible for wheel condition estimation. The monitoring approaches available to wheel defect detection can be divided into in-workshop inspection and in-service detection . The\nlatter provides the real-time data required for maintenance planning, while the former is normally carried out at workshops at fixed intervals. The commonly used in-workshop methods for wheel defect inspection include the ultrasonic techniques, infrared camera and magnetic methods . In-service monitoring approaches can be categorized as on-board and wayside methods. The on-board methods implement sensors on the train and continuously obtain comprehensive data from\nthe system. The methods of this category include magnetic technique , ultrasonic technique , acoustic technique, and vibration technique . On the other hand, wayside methods attempt to detect the wheel or vehicle performance\nby installing sensors on the rail or its surrounding areas. Such indirect measurements give rise to limited information of the wheel condition while they can monitor all train wheels going by with using only one or a few sensors. According to the type\nof sensors used, wayside detection approaches include strain sensing technology , fiber optic sensing technology ,\nultrasonic technique , vibration technique , acoustic emission , lasers and high-speed cameras . However,\nthe study on data interpretation techniques enabling the extraction of defect-sensitive features is far from sufficient.\nBayesian dynamic linear model (DLM) is an elegant system approach to handling time series data from a Bayesian perspective, which originates from the field of applied statistics and is extensively used in other fields such as economics\nand engineering [25–30]. The Bayesian DLM treats the time series as the output of a dynamic system perturbed by random disturbances. It is suitable for modeling both univariate and multivariate time series, and also for representing the structural changes, non-stationarity and irregular patterns . Unlike the classical time series method which assumes a fixed relationship between the dependent variables (response variables) and the independent variables (regressors), the DLM considers\nthe relationship changes over time and is able to directly capture time series data features, such as trend, seasonality,\nand regression effects. Moreover, the DLM allows for descriptions of temporary or permanent shifts in time series parameters that occur abruptly, which are necessary for outlier and damage detection in structural health monitoring (SHM) paradigms. Recently, Goulet and his collaborator adopted the Bayesian DLM theory in SHM to model the time-dependent\nresponses of structures by breaking them into subcomponents. In the perspective of real-time damage detection, only few studies are available. The first attempt was conducted by Lipowsky et al. with the development of a Bayesian DLM-based\nreal-time detection algorithm to evaluate the performance of a gas turbine using simulated data. Later on, Wang et al.\nand Zhang et al. adopted the above algorithm for detecting high-speed train defects by using real-world monitoring\ndata. In the previous studies, however, the real-time detection algorithm devised possesses only outlier identification and\nchange detection abilities, without the function of damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.context of Bayesian DLM, which incorporates logics for prognosis, potential outlier detection, identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and damage extent and uncertainty quantification. The Bayesian DLM is considered as a tool\nfor time series analysis, while Bayesian forecasting is executed to enable the calculation of one-step ahead forecast distribution. The change-point detection is performed by checking the current observation against the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM for current instant) as well as against an alternative model of which the mean value\nis shifted by a prescribed offset. The detection rule is that if the alternative model better fits the actual observation, a potential change is signaled. To further determine whether such an observation is only an outlier or the beginning of an actual\nchange (change-point), a specific logic is developed by introducing the Bayes factor and the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.\nThe main contributions of this study are the provision of: (i) a formula which not only enables the modeling of actual framework; (ii) three metrics (i.e., the Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) to allow for outlier\nand change-point detection in real-time manner; and (iii) an efficient way for damage extent assessment and uncertainty\nquantification. The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the Bayesian DLM theory and an elaboration of the Bayesian forecasting philosophy. Section 3 presents the defect detection methodology that incorporates logics for\noutlier detection, change-point identification, and damage assessment. In Section 4, two case studies making use of timeseries strain data acquired by fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors affixed on the bogies of an in-service high-speed train are offered to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the proposed methodology. Finally, conclusions are drawn in2. Bayesian DLM and forecastingThe Bayesian DLM is a kind of process-based Bayesian prediction model which provides a flexible way to intuitively capture how processes evolve over time. It consists of two basic equations: an observation (measurement) equation and a system (evolution) equation . The observation (measurement) equation describes the relationship between the observed\nrandom vectors with mean zero and unknown covariance matrices V t and W t. The DLM defined above amounts to treating ht\nrange level at time t, and at represents the stress range change between time t 1 and t. v t is the zero-mean Gaussian random variable representing the error of measurement at moment t. x1t and x2t are both zero-mean Gaussian random variables representing the evolution of DLM from time t 1 to t. In association with the form of DLM in Equation (1), we haveThe Bayesian forecasting philosophy is based on the description of an observed process using its probability density function (PDF). As implied by the name, the Bayesian forecasting approach commences from Bayes’ theorem, hence enabling the calculation of conditional probabilities. The details of using DLM for the recursive one-step ahead forecasting of the (posterior) distribution of monitoring-derived stress ranges under the Bayesian framework are presented as follows\nNote that in Step 4, Atþ1 is the adaptive coefficient which can be viewed as the information tuner. It scales the correction term according to the relative variances of the prior and likelihood, as measured by Rtþ1=Q tþ1 and regressor value Ftþ1. etþ1 is\nthe one-step forward forecast error, the difference between the observed value ytþ1 and its expectation f tþ1. More details\nabout the recursive one-step ahead forecast method can be found in .3. Defect detection methodologyThe proposed defect detection methodology contains three logical processes: outlier detection, change-point detection,\nand damage assessment. By comparing the real-time measurement with the predicted values, the named outlier detection and change-point detection are devised to determine whether the measurement is a single outlier or the first observation of a remarkable change, the former being executed by calculating the Bayes factor, while the latter being based on the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once a change-point is affirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for further damagePotential outlier detection is the first step in the process of the proposed defect detection approach, accomplished by the Bayes factor calculation. Bayes factor is advocated because of its straightforward and natural interpretation of evidence afforded by data. At every time step t, the Bayesian DLM can yield a PDF for the next measurement, labeled as M0. Meanwhile, an artificial alternative model labeled as M1 is defined by shifting the mean of M0 by +h. The underlying idea of outlier\ndetection is to check the current observation against both M0 and M1. For each time step t, the Bayes factor is the ratio of thewhere yt is the measurement at time t and Dt1 refers to the history information up to time t 1. In the case of Gaussianwhere h is the shift value; yt is the observation value; f t and rt are the mean and standard deviation of the forecasting distribution for observation at time t. A Bayes factor H ¼ 1 indicates that the probability of the observation derived from model M1 is identical to the probability of that derived from Model M0. For better quantitative comparison between any two models, Jeffreys suggested interpreting the Bayes factor as a scale of evidence and provided descriptive statements although\nthe partitions are somewhat arbitrary. According to his suggestion, a Bayes factor can be divided into several intervals for assessing the significance of discrimination: 1 < H < 3 is ‘barely worth mentioning’, 3 < H < 10 is ‘substantial’,\n10 < H < 30 is ‘strong’, 30 < H < 100 is ‘very strong’, and H > 100 is ‘decisive’. In this study, Hmin ¼ 10 is set as a threshold\nAfter the confirmation of Hmin and h, an uncertainty limit (ucl) can be procured by the following equationFor instance, when the confidence level a and threshold of Bayes factor Hmin are set as 90% and 10 respectively, the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt. Thus, an observation is diagnosed as an outlier if its deviation from the mean value of M0 is larger\nWith the Bayes factor defined in Equation (9), only outliers with a positive deviation can be detected. To enable the outliers with negative deviation to be detected as well, a second Bayes factor is defined asIn the automatic monitoring process, both the Bayes factors H1;t and H2;t should be examined in parallel to enable thebehavior, rather than judgments based on long past performances. Change-point is an abrupt variation in time series data,\nrepresenting a transition that occurs between states. Change-point detection aims to detect abrupt change in the generative\nprocess of sequential data. It is assumed that a sequence of observations y1; ; yT could be divided into several nonoverlapping partitions, e.g. dataset j 1, dataset j, and dataset j + 1 as shown in Fig. 2. The delineations between partitions\nare known as change-points (e.g. TOC j 1 and TOC j); the goal of change-point detection is the determination of where the\nboundary of two adjacent partitions is located in a sequence of observations. Change-point detection approaches can be classified into offline and online methods. The former needs to observe the whole sequential observations before aiming to make\ninference on the generative process of the sequence [37–40], wheras the latter aims to update the inference at each time step\nwith the newly acquired measurements from the sequence [41–43]. In particular, the Bayesian online change-point detection methods are based on computing the probability distribution of the run length.differentiate between the single-point outlier and the beginning of a continual change. To overcome this problem, cumulative Bayes factor (local Bayes factors) is recommended to detect change-point(s) in the sequence of observations, by definingwhere lmax is the maximum number of Bayes factors taken into account. Unlike Bayes factor with implicitly no historical influence in the judgement, the consecutive Bayes factors collect evidence of change over a series of observation (from time\net al. . Akin to the Bayes factor threshold for outlier detection, the threshold of maximal cumulative Bayes factors is set as Lmin ¼ 10. If the conditions Lt > Lmin and lt > lmin occur simultaneously, an alarm of change is immediately issued at time t\n(time of notification, TON). The real time of occurrence (TOC) is (t lt þ 1), that is, TOC =t lt þ 1.Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is performed to assess damage extent and quantify the\nassociated uncertainty. The proposed approach directly quantifies the likelihoods of two scenarios (e.g., the sequential observations before and after the change-point), that is, ‘‘no fault” and ‘‘fault”, and the yielded results are easy to interpret. An\nadditional merit of the proposed approach is its ability to quantify the uncertainty in damage detection. Assume that the observed sequential data can be divided into two non-overlapping partitions, the first of which is regarded as healthy\nof the observations. Thus, the damage detection problem becomes the test of H0 : l ¼ l0 versus H1 : l–l0 with\nWith the above, damage detection can be achieved by means of Bayes factor which is defined as the ratio of the probability of observations given the alternate hypothesis to the probability of observations given the null hypothesiswhere D ¼ yf 1; ; yng refers to the observed data. It is proven to bewhere refers to the mean of the observed data fy1; ; yng. If no prior information is available, the initial mean and variance can be set as q ¼ l0 and s ¼ r 0 [][. The two assumptions take the prior mean and variance in the alternative hypothesis as]where z ¼ pfn **f** i ffi l0 0 [ At each time step (i.e.,][ n][=1), the Bayes factor][ B][ is larger for the larger values of][ z][j j][, which is reasonable]and easy to interpret. The logarithm of the Bayes factor, for convenience of comparison among a larger of values, is derived asIf the Bayes factor B10 is larger than 1, the implication is that the observed data provide evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis H1 (i.e., the structure is damaged). Otherwise, the observed data are judged to support the null hypothesis H0 (i.e.,\nthe structure is healthy). As with the previous threshold, B10 10 is set as a threshold for damage indication.\nIntegrating together the outlier detection, change-point detection and damage assessment, the implementation procedures of the proposed methodology are shown in Fig. 3. Beginning at time t, the single Bayes factor is firstly evaluated to\njudge whether yt is an outlier. If not, the maximum cumulative Bayes factor Lt and run length lt for change-point detection are calculated. Once a change-point is detected, the intervention is carried out by resetting the time to the time of occurrence\n(i.e., TOC = t lt þ 1) and by adjusting the mean value of M0 to the observation yt (i.e., f t ¼ yt), and the subsequent analysis\nwill then be started at TOC. Meanwhile, Bayesian hypothesis testing is executed for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification from the current TOC to the next TOC.4. Application to in-service monitoring data of high-speed trainAn onboard monitoring system has been designed and implemented on an in-service high-speed passenger train running on the Lanzhou-Urumqi High-Speed Railway (LUHSR) in China . As shown in Fig. 4, the monitoring system is composed\nof a total of 52 FBG strain sensors, 4 FBG temperature sensors, 11 accelerometers (tri-axial) and 1 noise sensor deployed on both motor and trailer bogies. Also, one tri-axial FBG accelerometer, one video camera and two GPS sensors are installed inside a train carriage. As the present work is focused on the real-time detection of potentially defective wheels by using strain monitoring data from bogies, only the deployment of strain sensors is concerned. The strain sensors are mounted\non 4 measurement zones of the bogies: (i) the zone with the action of high loads; (ii) the stress transmission zone; (iii)\nthe zone with high responses predicted by finite element analysis; and (iv) welded joints. FBG strain (and temperature) sensors are deployed and attached to the surface of the train bogie with industrial glue and tapes, and connected to the interrogator (data logger) with laptop inside the train carriage through optical fiber cables.\nThe data utilized in this study were obtained from a monitoring schedule spanning 18 days as shown in Table 1. The total length of the LUHSR between Lanzhou and Urumqi is 1777 km. In the trip from Lanzhou to Urumqi, the high-speed train\nstops by 14 stations and travels cross 13 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 13th); in trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou, the high-speed train stops by 15 stations and travels cross 14 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 14th). During the monitoring\nperiod, the train operated at its normal speed around 200–250 km/h. The sampling rate for all the sensors was set at 5000\nSince the train wheels were lathed (lathing is a process to make wheels perfectly rounded) during the monitoring period,\nthe recorded data contain information in line with two different states (before lathing and after lathing). The wheels can be considered as potentially unhealthy (defective) before lathing and as healthy after lathing. To verify the effectiveness of theproposed real-time defect detection methodology, the strain monitoring data obtained from the bogies before and afterThe train’s dynamic responses may be influenced by different subgrade conditions of the railroad, such as ground, tunnel,\nand bridge. To eliminate the effects of different railroad conditions, the strain data recorded from the same railroad sectionbefore and after lathing, are used in each scenario. In addition, the passenger loads in different trips are deemed statistically identical and the speed of train is assumed to be constant as in normal operation. Without loss of generality, the monitoring\ndata respectively obtained from two typical railroad sections (1st and 14th) in the trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou are chosen to illustrate the proposed real-time defect detection methodology, which are from the strain gauge (MS3-7) deployed at the For the sake of brevity, the monitoring data collected from the 1st railroad section are denoted as Case 1, while those from the 14th railroad section are denoted as Case 2. Firstly, the measured strain is converted to stress for the subsequent stress\nrange calculation. For the strain gauges mounted on the steel surface, the conversion of the measured strain to stress is made by rs ¼ Ee, where E is the elasticity modulus of steel and e is the strain after eliminating the effect of varying temperatures.where em is the measured strain, T m is the measured temperature in the vicinity of the strain sensor, T 0 is the temperature at\nthe installation, and a1 is a constant coefficient. In our case, the original temperature is 4, i.e., T 0 ¼ 4. The results of temperature compensation are demonstrated in Fig. 5. It is obvious that the trend in strain responses caused by temperature\nAfterwards, the stress ranges are extracted from the monitoring-derived stress data by the application of the rainflow\ncounting algorithm. From each stress cycle, the stress range Sa is obtained by calculating the difference between the maximum stress rmax and the minimum stress rmin measured in that stress cycle, i.e., Sa ¼ rmax rmin. More details on the stress ranges extraction are given in . The stress ranges with amplitudes lower than 1 MPa need to be culled because the majority are caused by noise. To decrease the uncertainty arising from the measurement facilities, the average stress ranges for\nevery ten minutes are used as the target quantities. Due to the different lengths of the two selected railroad sections (1st and 14th), the traveling time of the train in each section is also different. This results in different data lengths. The data\nlengths of the average stress ranges in Case 1 and Case 2 are 110 and 90, respectively. Figs. and 7 show the original measured strain responses before and after lathing in Case 1 and Case 2, respectively.Following the implementation procedures mentioned before, the defect detection results for Case 1 are demonstrated in\nFigs. and 9. Fig. 8(a) shows the average stress range (red point) together with 1-step ahead prediction (blue solid line) and\nthe corresponding 90% prediction interval (grey shadow). It is observed that, although some observations at the time interval t 2 fall outside the 90% prediction interval, only the Bayes factor at time t ¼ 55 exceeds the established threshold of Hmin ¼ 10 as shown in Fig. 9(a). It is thus judged as an outlier (marked as h). The reason is that because when applying the proposed approach, the shift parameter is set as h ¼ 1:645rt, resulting in the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt while the other\nfour observations are still within the uncertainty limit. On the other hand, Fig. 9(b)–(c) shows the results of the maximum cumulative Bayes factor and the corresponding run length for change detection. It is seen that the maximum cumulative\nBayes factor values at time instants t ¼ 56; 57 and 58 are larger than the threshold of Lmin ¼ 10, while merely the run length at instant t ¼ 58 surpasses the threshold of lmin ¼ 4. Apparently, this observation at time t ¼ 58 fulfills the conditions of change-point detection causing an alarm to be issued (i.e., TON ¼ 58). The identified real occurrence time of change-point is t ¼ 55 (i.e., TOC ¼ 58 4 þ 1 ¼ 55), which coincides well with the actual time point of lathing the wheels. In accordance\nwith the real-time identification of change-point occurrence, the prediction model is refined by altering the guessed mean\nvalue at TOC, as shown in Fig. 8(b). The predictions near TOC in the refined model obviously agree well with the actual observations, thus offering a better prediction performance than that of the original model.\nThe results of defect detection by means of Bayesian hypothesis testing are illustrated in Fig. 9(d). The discrimination between ‘‘healthy” and ‘‘defective” is quantified by the logarithm value of Bayes factor. It is seen from Fig. 9(d) that the vast\nmajority of logarithm values of Bayes factor before TOC are nearly zero and below the threshold level (dotted red line), which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘healthy state” (no defect). This is consistent with the actual health condition and thus validatesthe capability of the Bayesian hypothesis testing. On the contrary, all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than 2, meaning that the corresponding Bayes factor values exceed 100. According to the classification of Bayes factor stipulated in Sub-section 3.1, this result (H > 100) favors the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity is classified as ‘‘decisive”. Indeed, wheels immediately before being sent to depot for lathing were in the state of ‘heavily defective’.\nMaking use of Eq. (21), the probabilities of damage after TOC are obtained as 100%, that is, the wheels are identified as defective with a very high confidence.\nThe defect detection results for Case 2 are similar to Case 1, and are illustrated in Figs. and 11. As seen in Fig. 11(a)–(c)\nno outlier exists throughout the whole period, but a change-point is identified, of which the time of notification is t ¼ 44 (i.e.,\nTON ¼ 44) and the real time of occurrence is t ¼ 41 (i.e., TOC ¼ 44 4 þ 1 ¼ 41). The result matches well with the actual time point when wheel lathing is inflicted. For the predictions near the change-point, the modified prediction model\n(Fig. 10(b)) offers a better performance than the original model (Fig. 10(a)). As illustrated in Fig. 11(d), all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than the threshold (dotted red line), whereas the values before TOC are within thethreshold line. The values of Bayes factor after TOC are obtained to be higher than 100 (H > 100) and the corresponding probabilities of damage are approximately 100%, which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity\nApart from the accuracy of the proposed approach, the computational efficiency is also of concern. The algorithmic implementation is performed on a Lenovo ThinkCentre M720t desktop (Lenovo, Beijing, China) with Dual Intel Core i7-8700 processor (Intel, California, USA) and 24 GB of memory. The computation times consumed in Case 1 and Case 2 are 4.0109 s and\n3.7704 s respectively. In this sense, it realizes the detection of wheel defects in real time.5. ConclusionsA novel methodology for real-time defect detection of high-speed train wheels using Bayesian forecasting and dynamic linear model (DLM) has been developed and validated in this study. First, the DLM is formulated to approximate the actual\nframework. Afterwards, three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) are elicited for outlier detection and change-point detection. After the change-point has been confirmed, damage assessment is executed by the Bayesian hypothesis testing of the sequential observations before and after the change-point. Due to accommodating the dynamic evolution process and the statistical nature of the method, the proposed approach not only possesses the ability of real-time damage detection, but also enables damage quantification (through classifying the range of Bayes factor) and uncertainty assessment (through calculating the probability of damage). The methodology is illustrated by using the onlinelathing). In the two cases addressed, wheel defects are successfully identified, hence validating the effectiveness of the developed method. The quantitative results about the damage extent and confidence would provide useful information helping to\nmake cost-effective, risk-based decisions with the aim of maintaining the operation safety of high-speed rail.\nDespite the proposed methodology being developed for wheel defect detection of high-speed trains, it can also be applied to low-speed passenger and freight trains as well as extended to SHM for a wide variety of civil infrastructure (e.g., bridges,\nbuildings and tunnels) when vibration signals are available via monitoring. In this study, the second-order polynomial DLM\nis employed to model the stress ranges, which only considers the change of stress range level and trend. However, most longterm SHM data, especially long-term strain monitoring data, are generally contaminated by trend, seasonal (cyclical) and\nregression effects, which require a more complex model. The Bayesian DLM enables the modeling of time-dependent responses of a structure by integrating appropriate components, for instance, the response with cyclical characteristics\ncan be depicted by embedding a seasonal (cyclical) component. Thus, in accordance with the nature of monitoring data,\nan appropriate Bayesian DLM enabling to describe time series data of different features, can be formulated for damage detection of a variety of structures subject to different operational/environmental conditions.Administrative Region, China (Project No. PolyU 152024/17E).

IntroductionHigh-speed rail (HSR) is being developed in Asian and European countries to satisfy the rapidly growing demand for intercity services and to shore up economic growth. The rapid\ngrowth of HSR, however, has posed great challenges regarding operation safety, reliability\nand ride comfort. Irregular wheel defects can induce high-magnitude impact forces hindering safety and ride comfort of HSR and may also cause damage to rail tracks and vehicles.real time. The proposed methodology embraces logics for (i) prognosis, (ii) potential outlier\ndetection, (iii) identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and (iv) quantification of damage extent and uncertainty. Relying on the strain monitoring data acquired from high-speed train bogies, the Bayesian DLM for characterizing the actual stress ranges is established, by which one-step forecast distribution is elicited before proceeding to the\nnext observation. The detection of change-point is executed by comparing the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM) and an alternative model\n(the mean value is shifted by a prescribed offset) to determine which better fits the actual observation. If the comparison results are in favor of the alternative model, it is claimed that a potential change has occurred. Whether such an observation is an outlier or the beginning of a genuine change (change-point), three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum\ncumulative Bayes factor and run length) are performed for further identification.

Rail accidents were occasionally caused by failures such as severe defects or fatigue of railway components. To maintain a good service quality and operation safety, it is paramount to develop\nonline monitoring techniques that not only quickly recognize faults of mission-critical HSR components but also can anticipate of long-term mechanisms and gradual deterioration in performance.\nWheelsets in a high-speed train are physically connected with and controlled by the bogie system which corrects alignment for stable running and reduces the vibration caused by wheel-rail interaction . However, the wheel performance\nprogressively deteriorates in different mechanisms (e.g., wheel flat and wheel polygonization) during the routine operation of a high-speed train . Wheel performance deterioration increases stresses experienced by the bogie system. In addition,\nthe increased stress within bogie frames caused by wheel quality deterioration can be unexpectedly large, thus posing a serious threat to the operation safety of concerned trains. According to the statistics of train accidents caused by failure in\nmechanical components during 2004 to 2007 in the United States, the wheelsets faults are the most cause with a rate of\n44.7% . Therefore, the railway managers are keen to keep wheels in an adequate condition and detect potential failure\nas soon as possible. For railway wheels, there are three different ways of estimating the conditions: physical modeling, statistical modeling and condition monitoring . However, the first two ways are not applicable to in-service\nwheel condition assessment, and in contrast, the third way is most feasible for wheel condition estimation. The monitoring approaches available to wheel defect detection can be divided into in-workshop inspection and in-service detection . The\nlatter provides the real-time data required for maintenance planning, while the former is normally carried out at workshops at fixed intervals. The commonly used in-workshop methods for wheel defect inspection include the ultrasonic techniques, infrared camera and magnetic methods . In-service monitoring approaches can be categorized as on-board and wayside methods. The on-board methods implement sensors on the train and continuously obtain comprehensive data from\nthe system. The methods of this category include magnetic technique , ultrasonic technique , acoustic technique, and vibration technique . On the other hand, wayside methods attempt to detect the wheel or vehicle performance\nby installing sensors on the rail or its surrounding areas. Such indirect measurements give rise to limited information of the wheel condition while they can monitor all train wheels going by with using only one or a few sensors. According to the type\nof sensors used, wayside detection approaches include strain sensing technology , fiber optic sensing technology ,\nultrasonic technique , vibration technique , acoustic emission , lasers and high-speed cameras . However,\nthe study on data interpretation techniques enabling the extraction of defect-sensitive features is far from sufficient.\nBayesian dynamic linear model (DLM) is an elegant system approach to handling time series data from a Bayesian perspective, which originates from the field of applied statistics and is extensively used in other fields such as economics\nand engineering [25–30]. The Bayesian DLM treats the time series as the output of a dynamic system perturbed by random disturbances. It is suitable for modeling both univariate and multivariate time series, and also for representing the structural changes, non-stationarity and irregular patterns . Unlike the classical time series method which assumes a fixed relationship between the dependent variables (response variables) and the independent variables (regressors), the DLM considers\nthe relationship changes over time and is able to directly capture time series data features, such as trend, seasonality,\nand regression effects. Moreover, the DLM allows for descriptions of temporary or permanent shifts in time series parameters that occur abruptly, which are necessary for outlier and damage detection in structural health monitoring (SHM) paradigms. Recently, Goulet and his collaborator adopted the Bayesian DLM theory in SHM to model the time-dependent\nresponses of structures by breaking them into subcomponents. In the perspective of real-time damage detection, only few studies are available. The first attempt was conducted by Lipowsky et al. with the development of a Bayesian DLM-based\nreal-time detection algorithm to evaluate the performance of a gas turbine using simulated data. Later on, Wang et al.\nand Zhang et al. adopted the above algorithm for detecting high-speed train defects by using real-world monitoring\ndata. In the previous studies, however, the real-time detection algorithm devised possesses only outlier identification and\nchange detection abilities, without the function of damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.context of Bayesian DLM, which incorporates logics for prognosis, potential outlier detection, identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and damage extent and uncertainty quantification. The Bayesian DLM is considered as a tool\nfor time series analysis, while Bayesian forecasting is executed to enable the calculation of one-step ahead forecast distribution. The change-point detection is performed by checking the current observation against the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM for current instant) as well as against an alternative model of which the mean value\nis shifted by a prescribed offset. The detection rule is that if the alternative model better fits the actual observation, a potential change is signaled. To further determine whether such an observation is only an outlier or the beginning of an actual\nchange (change-point), a specific logic is developed by introducing the Bayes factor and the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.\nThe main contributions of this study are the provision of: (i) a formula which not only enables the modeling of actual framework; (ii) three metrics (i.e., the Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) to allow for outlier\nand change-point detection in real-time manner; and (iii) an efficient way for damage extent assessment and uncertainty\nquantification. The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the Bayesian DLM theory and an elaboration of the Bayesian forecasting philosophy. Section 3 presents the defect detection methodology that incorporates logics for\noutlier detection, change-point identification, and damage assessment. In Section 4, two case studies making use of timeseries strain data acquired by fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors affixed on the bogies of an in-service high-speed train are offered to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the proposed methodology. Finally, conclusions are drawn in2. Bayesian DLM and forecastingThe Bayesian DLM is a kind of process-based Bayesian prediction model which provides a flexible way to intuitively capture how processes evolve over time. It consists of two basic equations: an observation (measurement) equation and a system (evolution) equation . The observation (measurement) equation describes the relationship between the observed\nrandom vectors with mean zero and unknown covariance matrices V t and W t. The DLM defined above amounts to treating ht\nrange level at time t, and at represents the stress range change between time t 1 and t. v t is the zero-mean Gaussian random variable representing the error of measurement at moment t. x1t and x2t are both zero-mean Gaussian random variables representing the evolution of DLM from time t 1 to t. In association with the form of DLM in Equation (1), we haveThe Bayesian forecasting philosophy is based on the description of an observed process using its probability density function (PDF). As implied by the name, the Bayesian forecasting approach commences from Bayes’ theorem, hence enabling the calculation of conditional probabilities. The details of using DLM for the recursive one-step ahead forecasting of the (posterior) distribution of monitoring-derived stress ranges under the Bayesian framework are presented as follows\nNote that in Step 4, Atþ1 is the adaptive coefficient which can be viewed as the information tuner. It scales the correction term according to the relative variances of the prior and likelihood, as measured by Rtþ1=Q tþ1 and regressor value Ftþ1. etþ1 is\nthe one-step forward forecast error, the difference between the observed value ytþ1 and its expectation f tþ1. More details\nabout the recursive one-step ahead forecast method can be found in .3. Defect detection methodologyThe proposed defect detection methodology contains three logical processes: outlier detection, change-point detection,\nand damage assessment. By comparing the real-time measurement with the predicted values, the named outlier detection and change-point detection are devised to determine whether the measurement is a single outlier or the first observation of a remarkable change, the former being executed by calculating the Bayes factor, while the latter being based on the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once a change-point is affirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for further damagePotential outlier detection is the first step in the process of the proposed defect detection approach, accomplished by the Bayes factor calculation. Bayes factor is advocated because of its straightforward and natural interpretation of evidence afforded by data. At every time step t, the Bayesian DLM can yield a PDF for the next measurement, labeled as M0. Meanwhile, an artificial alternative model labeled as M1 is defined by shifting the mean of M0 by +h. The underlying idea of outlier\ndetection is to check the current observation against both M0 and M1. For each time step t, the Bayes factor is the ratio of thewhere yt is the measurement at time t and Dt1 refers to the history information up to time t 1. In the case of Gaussianwhere h is the shift value; yt is the observation value; f t and rt are the mean and standard deviation of the forecasting distribution for observation at time t. A Bayes factor H ¼ 1 indicates that the probability of the observation derived from model M1 is identical to the probability of that derived from Model M0. For better quantitative comparison between any two models, Jeffreys suggested interpreting the Bayes factor as a scale of evidence and provided descriptive statements although\nthe partitions are somewhat arbitrary. According to his suggestion, a Bayes factor can be divided into several intervals for assessing the significance of discrimination: 1 < H < 3 is ‘barely worth mentioning’, 3 < H < 10 is ‘substantial’,\n10 < H < 30 is ‘strong’, 30 < H < 100 is ‘very strong’, and H > 100 is ‘decisive’. In this study, Hmin ¼ 10 is set as a threshold\nAfter the confirmation of Hmin and h, an uncertainty limit (ucl) can be procured by the following equationFor instance, when the confidence level a and threshold of Bayes factor Hmin are set as 90% and 10 respectively, the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt. Thus, an observation is diagnosed as an outlier if its deviation from the mean value of M0 is larger\nWith the Bayes factor defined in Equation (9), only outliers with a positive deviation can be detected. To enable the outliers with negative deviation to be detected as well, a second Bayes factor is defined asIn the automatic monitoring process, both the Bayes factors H1;t and H2;t should be examined in parallel to enable thebehavior, rather than judgments based on long past performances. Change-point is an abrupt variation in time series data,\nrepresenting a transition that occurs between states. Change-point detection aims to detect abrupt change in the generative\nprocess of sequential data. It is assumed that a sequence of observations y1; ; yT could be divided into several nonoverlapping partitions, e.g. dataset j 1, dataset j, and dataset j + 1 as shown in Fig. 2. The delineations between partitions\nare known as change-points (e.g. TOC j 1 and TOC j); the goal of change-point detection is the determination of where the\nboundary of two adjacent partitions is located in a sequence of observations. Change-point detection approaches can be classified into offline and online methods. The former needs to observe the whole sequential observations before aiming to make\ninference on the generative process of the sequence [37–40], wheras the latter aims to update the inference at each time step\nwith the newly acquired measurements from the sequence [41–43]. In particular, the Bayesian online change-point detection methods are based on computing the probability distribution of the run length.differentiate between the single-point outlier and the beginning of a continual change. To overcome this problem, cumulative Bayes factor (local Bayes factors) is recommended to detect change-point(s) in the sequence of observations, by definingwhere lmax is the maximum number of Bayes factors taken into account. Unlike Bayes factor with implicitly no historical influence in the judgement, the consecutive Bayes factors collect evidence of change over a series of observation (from time\net al. . Akin to the Bayes factor threshold for outlier detection, the threshold of maximal cumulative Bayes factors is set as Lmin ¼ 10. If the conditions Lt > Lmin and lt > lmin occur simultaneously, an alarm of change is immediately issued at time t\n(time of notification, TON). The real time of occurrence (TOC) is (t lt þ 1), that is, TOC =t lt þ 1.Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is performed to assess damage extent and quantify the\nassociated uncertainty. The proposed approach directly quantifies the likelihoods of two scenarios (e.g., the sequential observations before and after the change-point), that is, ‘‘no fault” and ‘‘fault”, and the yielded results are easy to interpret. An\nadditional merit of the proposed approach is its ability to quantify the uncertainty in damage detection. Assume that the observed sequential data can be divided into two non-overlapping partitions, the first of which is regarded as healthy\nof the observations. Thus, the damage detection problem becomes the test of H0 : l ¼ l0 versus H1 : l–l0 with\nWith the above, damage detection can be achieved by means of Bayes factor which is defined as the ratio of the probability of observations given the alternate hypothesis to the probability of observations given the null hypothesiswhere D ¼ yf 1; ; yng refers to the observed data. It is proven to bewhere refers to the mean of the observed data fy1; ; yng. If no prior information is available, the initial mean and variance can be set as q ¼ l0 and s ¼ r 0 [][. The two assumptions take the prior mean and variance in the alternative hypothesis as]where z ¼ pfn **f** i ffi l0 0 [ At each time step (i.e.,][ n][=1), the Bayes factor][ B][ is larger for the larger values of][ z][j j][, which is reasonable]and easy to interpret. The logarithm of the Bayes factor, for convenience of comparison among a larger of values, is derived asIf the Bayes factor B10 is larger than 1, the implication is that the observed data provide evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis H1 (i.e., the structure is damaged). Otherwise, the observed data are judged to support the null hypothesis H0 (i.e.,\nthe structure is healthy). As with the previous threshold, B10 10 is set as a threshold for damage indication.\nIntegrating together the outlier detection, change-point detection and damage assessment, the implementation procedures of the proposed methodology are shown in Fig. 3. Beginning at time t, the single Bayes factor is firstly evaluated to\njudge whether yt is an outlier. If not, the maximum cumulative Bayes factor Lt and run length lt for change-point detection are calculated. Once a change-point is detected, the intervention is carried out by resetting the time to the time of occurrence\n(i.e., TOC = t lt þ 1) and by adjusting the mean value of M0 to the observation yt (i.e., f t ¼ yt), and the subsequent analysis\nwill then be started at TOC. Meanwhile, Bayesian hypothesis testing is executed for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification from the current TOC to the next TOC.4. Application to in-service monitoring data of high-speed trainAn onboard monitoring system has been designed and implemented on an in-service high-speed passenger train running on the Lanzhou-Urumqi High-Speed Railway (LUHSR) in China . As shown in Fig. 4, the monitoring system is composed\nof a total of 52 FBG strain sensors, 4 FBG temperature sensors, 11 accelerometers (tri-axial) and 1 noise sensor deployed on both motor and trailer bogies. Also, one tri-axial FBG accelerometer, one video camera and two GPS sensors are installed inside a train carriage. As the present work is focused on the real-time detection of potentially defective wheels by using strain monitoring data from bogies, only the deployment of strain sensors is concerned. The strain sensors are mounted\non 4 measurement zones of the bogies: (i) the zone with the action of high loads; (ii) the stress transmission zone; (iii)\nthe zone with high responses predicted by finite element analysis; and (iv) welded joints. FBG strain (and temperature) sensors are deployed and attached to the surface of the train bogie with industrial glue and tapes, and connected to the interrogator (data logger) with laptop inside the train carriage through optical fiber cables.\nThe data utilized in this study were obtained from a monitoring schedule spanning 18 days as shown in Table 1. The total length of the LUHSR between Lanzhou and Urumqi is 1777 km. In the trip from Lanzhou to Urumqi, the high-speed train\nstops by 14 stations and travels cross 13 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 13th); in trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou, the high-speed train stops by 15 stations and travels cross 14 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 14th). During the monitoring\nperiod, the train operated at its normal speed around 200–250 km/h. The sampling rate for all the sensors was set at 5000\nSince the train wheels were lathed (lathing is a process to make wheels perfectly rounded) during the monitoring period,\nthe recorded data contain information in line with two different states (before lathing and after lathing). The wheels can be considered as potentially unhealthy (defective) before lathing and as healthy after lathing. To verify the effectiveness of theproposed real-time defect detection methodology, the strain monitoring data obtained from the bogies before and afterThe train’s dynamic responses may be influenced by different subgrade conditions of the railroad, such as ground, tunnel,\nand bridge. To eliminate the effects of different railroad conditions, the strain data recorded from the same railroad sectionbefore and after lathing, are used in each scenario. In addition, the passenger loads in different trips are deemed statistically identical and the speed of train is assumed to be constant as in normal operation. Without loss of generality, the monitoring\ndata respectively obtained from two typical railroad sections (1st and 14th) in the trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou are chosen to illustrate the proposed real-time defect detection methodology, which are from the strain gauge (MS3-7) deployed at the For the sake of brevity, the monitoring data collected from the 1st railroad section are denoted as Case 1, while those from the 14th railroad section are denoted as Case 2. Firstly, the measured strain is converted to stress for the subsequent stress\nrange calculation. For the strain gauges mounted on the steel surface, the conversion of the measured strain to stress is made by rs ¼ Ee, where E is the elasticity modulus of steel and e is the strain after eliminating the effect of varying temperatures.where em is the measured strain, T m is the measured temperature in the vicinity of the strain sensor, T 0 is the temperature at\nthe installation, and a1 is a constant coefficient. In our case, the original temperature is 4, i.e., T 0 ¼ 4. The results of temperature compensation are demonstrated in Fig. 5. It is obvious that the trend in strain responses caused by temperature\nAfterwards, the stress ranges are extracted from the monitoring-derived stress data by the application of the rainflow\ncounting algorithm. From each stress cycle, the stress range Sa is obtained by calculating the difference between the maximum stress rmax and the minimum stress rmin measured in that stress cycle, i.e., Sa ¼ rmax rmin. More details on the stress ranges extraction are given in . The stress ranges with amplitudes lower than 1 MPa need to be culled because the majority are caused by noise. To decrease the uncertainty arising from the measurement facilities, the average stress ranges for\nevery ten minutes are used as the target quantities. Due to the different lengths of the two selected railroad sections (1st and 14th), the traveling time of the train in each section is also different. This results in different data lengths. The data\nlengths of the average stress ranges in Case 1 and Case 2 are 110 and 90, respectively. Figs. and 7 show the original measured strain responses before and after lathing in Case 1 and Case 2, respectively.Following the implementation procedures mentioned before, the defect detection results for Case 1 are demonstrated in\nFigs. and 9. Fig. 8(a) shows the average stress range (red point) together with 1-step ahead prediction (blue solid line) and\nthe corresponding 90% prediction interval (grey shadow). It is observed that, although some observations at the time interval t 2 fall outside the 90% prediction interval, only the Bayes factor at time t ¼ 55 exceeds the established threshold of Hmin ¼ 10 as shown in Fig. 9(a). It is thus judged as an outlier (marked as h). The reason is that because when applying the proposed approach, the shift parameter is set as h ¼ 1:645rt, resulting in the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt while the other\nfour observations are still within the uncertainty limit. On the other hand, Fig. 9(b)–(c) shows the results of the maximum cumulative Bayes factor and the corresponding run length for change detection. It is seen that the maximum cumulative\nBayes factor values at time instants t ¼ 56; 57 and 58 are larger than the threshold of Lmin ¼ 10, while merely the run length at instant t ¼ 58 surpasses the threshold of lmin ¼ 4. Apparently, this observation at time t ¼ 58 fulfills the conditions of change-point detection causing an alarm to be issued (i.e., TON ¼ 58). The identified real occurrence time of change-point is t ¼ 55 (i.e., TOC ¼ 58 4 þ 1 ¼ 55), which coincides well with the actual time point of lathing the wheels. In accordance\nwith the real-time identification of change-point occurrence, the prediction model is refined by altering the guessed mean\nvalue at TOC, as shown in Fig. 8(b). The predictions near TOC in the refined model obviously agree well with the actual observations, thus offering a better prediction performance than that of the original model.\nThe results of defect detection by means of Bayesian hypothesis testing are illustrated in Fig. 9(d). The discrimination between ‘‘healthy” and ‘‘defective” is quantified by the logarithm value of Bayes factor. It is seen from Fig. 9(d) that the vast\nmajority of logarithm values of Bayes factor before TOC are nearly zero and below the threshold level (dotted red line), which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘healthy state” (no defect). This is consistent with the actual health condition and thus validatesthe capability of the Bayesian hypothesis testing. On the contrary, all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than 2, meaning that the corresponding Bayes factor values exceed 100. According to the classification of Bayes factor stipulated in Sub-section 3.1, this result (H > 100) favors the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity is classified as ‘‘decisive”. Indeed, wheels immediately before being sent to depot for lathing were in the state of ‘heavily defective’.\nMaking use of Eq. (21), the probabilities of damage after TOC are obtained as 100%, that is, the wheels are identified as defective with a very high confidence.\nThe defect detection results for Case 2 are similar to Case 1, and are illustrated in Figs. and 11. As seen in Fig. 11(a)–(c)\nno outlier exists throughout the whole period, but a change-point is identified, of which the time of notification is t ¼ 44 (i.e.,\nTON ¼ 44) and the real time of occurrence is t ¼ 41 (i.e., TOC ¼ 44 4 þ 1 ¼ 41). The result matches well with the actual time point when wheel lathing is inflicted. For the predictions near the change-point, the modified prediction model\n(Fig. 10(b)) offers a better performance than the original model (Fig. 10(a)). As illustrated in Fig. 11(d), all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than the threshold (dotted red line), whereas the values before TOC are within thethreshold line. The values of Bayes factor after TOC are obtained to be higher than 100 (H > 100) and the corresponding probabilities of damage are approximately 100%, which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity\nApart from the accuracy of the proposed approach, the computational efficiency is also of concern. The algorithmic implementation is performed on a Lenovo ThinkCentre M720t desktop (Lenovo, Beijing, China) with Dual Intel Core i7-8700 processor (Intel, California, USA) and 24 GB of memory. The computation times consumed in Case 1 and Case 2 are 4.0109 s and\n3.7704 s respectively. In this sense, it realizes the detection of wheel defects in real time.5. ConclusionsA novel methodology for real-time defect detection of high-speed train wheels using Bayesian forecasting and dynamic linear model (DLM) has been developed and validated in this study. First, the DLM is formulated to approximate the actual\nframework. Afterwards, three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) are elicited for outlier detection and change-point detection. After the change-point has been confirmed, damage assessment is executed by the Bayesian hypothesis testing of the sequential observations before and after the change-point. Due to accommodating the dynamic evolution process and the statistical nature of the method, the proposed approach not only possesses the ability of real-time damage detection, but also enables damage quantification (through classifying the range of Bayes factor) and uncertainty assessment (through calculating the probability of damage). The methodology is illustrated by using the onlinelathing). In the two cases addressed, wheel defects are successfully identified, hence validating the effectiveness of the developed method. The quantitative results about the damage extent and confidence would provide useful information helping to\nmake cost-effective, risk-based decisions with the aim of maintaining the operation safety of high-speed rail.\nDespite the proposed methodology being developed for wheel defect detection of high-speed trains, it can also be applied to low-speed passenger and freight trains as well as extended to SHM for a wide variety of civil infrastructure (e.g., bridges,\nbuildings and tunnels) when vibration signals are available via monitoring. In this study, the second-order polynomial DLM\nis employed to model the stress ranges, which only considers the change of stress range level and trend. However, most longterm SHM data, especially long-term strain monitoring data, are generally contaminated by trend, seasonal (cyclical) and\nregression effects, which require a more complex model. The Bayesian DLM enables the modeling of time-dependent responses of a structure by integrating appropriate components, for instance, the response with cyclical characteristics\ncan be depicted by embedding a seasonal (cyclical) component. Thus, in accordance with the nature of monitoring data,\nan appropriate Bayesian DLM enabling to describe time series data of different features, can be formulated for damage detection of a variety of structures subject to different operational/environmental conditions.Administrative Region, China (Project No. PolyU 152024/17E).

IntroductionHigh-speed rail (HSR) is being developed in Asian and European countries to satisfy the rapidly growing demand for intercity services and to shore up economic growth. The rapid\ngrowth of HSR, however, has posed great challenges regarding operation safety, reliability\nand ride comfort. Irregular wheel defects can induce high-magnitude impact forces hindering safety and ride comfort of HSR and may also cause damage to rail tracks and vehicles.real time. The proposed methodology embraces logics for (i) prognosis, (ii) potential outlier\ndetection, (iii) identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and (iv) quantification of damage extent and uncertainty. Relying on the strain monitoring data acquired from high-speed train bogies, the Bayesian DLM for characterizing the actual stress ranges is established, by which one-step forecast distribution is elicited before proceeding to the\nnext observation. The detection of change-point is executed by comparing the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM) and an alternative model\n(the mean value is shifted by a prescribed offset) to determine which better fits the actual observation. If the comparison results are in favor of the alternative model, it is claimed that a potential change has occurred. Whether such an observation is an outlier or the beginning of a genuine change (change-point), three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum\ncumulative Bayes factor and run length) are performed for further identification.

Rail accidents were occasionally caused by failures such as severe defects or fatigue of railway components. To maintain a good service quality and operation safety, it is paramount to develop\nonline monitoring techniques that not only quickly recognize faults of mission-critical HSR components but also can anticipate of long-term mechanisms and gradual deterioration in performance.\nWheelsets in a high-speed train are physically connected with and controlled by the bogie system which corrects alignment for stable running and reduces the vibration caused by wheel-rail interaction . However, the wheel performance\nprogressively deteriorates in different mechanisms (e.g., wheel flat and wheel polygonization) during the routine operation of a high-speed train . Wheel performance deterioration increases stresses experienced by the bogie system. In addition,\nthe increased stress within bogie frames caused by wheel quality deterioration can be unexpectedly large, thus posing a serious threat to the operation safety of concerned trains. According to the statistics of train accidents caused by failure in\nmechanical components during 2004 to 2007 in the United States, the wheelsets faults are the most cause with a rate of\n44.7% . Therefore, the railway managers are keen to keep wheels in an adequate condition and detect potential failure\nas soon as possible. For railway wheels, there are three different ways of estimating the conditions: physical modeling, statistical modeling and condition monitoring . However, the first two ways are not applicable to in-service\nwheel condition assessment, and in contrast, the third way is most feasible for wheel condition estimation. The monitoring approaches available to wheel defect detection can be divided into in-workshop inspection and in-service detection . The\nlatter provides the real-time data required for maintenance planning, while the former is normally carried out at workshops at fixed intervals. The commonly used in-workshop methods for wheel defect inspection include the ultrasonic techniques, infrared camera and magnetic methods . In-service monitoring approaches can be categorized as on-board and wayside methods. The on-board methods implement sensors on the train and continuously obtain comprehensive data from\nthe system. The methods of this category include magnetic technique , ultrasonic technique , acoustic technique, and vibration technique . On the other hand, wayside methods attempt to detect the wheel or vehicle performance\nby installing sensors on the rail or its surrounding areas. Such indirect measurements give rise to limited information of the wheel condition while they can monitor all train wheels going by with using only one or a few sensors. According to the type\nof sensors used, wayside detection approaches include strain sensing technology , fiber optic sensing technology ,\nultrasonic technique , vibration technique , acoustic emission , lasers and high-speed cameras . However,\nthe study on data interpretation techniques enabling the extraction of defect-sensitive features is far from sufficient.\nBayesian dynamic linear model (DLM) is an elegant system approach to handling time series data from a Bayesian perspective, which originates from the field of applied statistics and is extensively used in other fields such as economics\nand engineering [25–30]. The Bayesian DLM treats the time series as the output of a dynamic system perturbed by random disturbances. It is suitable for modeling both univariate and multivariate time series, and also for representing the structural changes, non-stationarity and irregular patterns . Unlike the classical time series method which assumes a fixed relationship between the dependent variables (response variables) and the independent variables (regressors), the DLM considers\nthe relationship changes over time and is able to directly capture time series data features, such as trend, seasonality,\nand regression effects. Moreover, the DLM allows for descriptions of temporary or permanent shifts in time series parameters that occur abruptly, which are necessary for outlier and damage detection in structural health monitoring (SHM) paradigms. Recently, Goulet and his collaborator adopted the Bayesian DLM theory in SHM to model the time-dependent\nresponses of structures by breaking them into subcomponents. In the perspective of real-time damage detection, only few studies are available. The first attempt was conducted by Lipowsky et al. with the development of a Bayesian DLM-based\nreal-time detection algorithm to evaluate the performance of a gas turbine using simulated data.

The Bayesian DLM is considered as a tool\nfor time series analysis, while Bayesian forecasting is executed to enable the calculation of one-step ahead forecast distribution. The change-point detection is performed by checking the current observation against the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM for current instant) as well as against an alternative model of which the mean value\nis shifted by a prescribed offset. The detection rule is that if the alternative model better fits the actual observation, a potential change is signaled. To further determine whether such an observation is only an outlier or the beginning of an actual\nchange (change-point), a specific logic is developed by introducing the Bayes factor and the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.\nThe main contributions of this study are the provision of: (i) a formula which not only enables the modeling of actual framework; (ii) three metrics (i.e., the Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) to allow for outlier\nand change-point detection in real-time manner; and (iii) an efficient way for damage extent assessment and uncertainty\nquantification. The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the Bayesian DLM theory and an elaboration of the Bayesian forecasting philosophy. Section 3 presents the defect detection methodology that incorporates logics for\noutlier detection, change-point identification, and damage assessment. In Section 4, two case studies making use of timeseries strain data acquired by fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors affixed on the bogies of an in-service high-speed train are offered to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the proposed methodology. Finally, conclusions are drawn in2. Bayesian DLM and forecastingThe Bayesian DLM is a kind of process-based Bayesian prediction model which provides a flexible way to intuitively capture how processes evolve over time. It consists of two basic equations: an observation (measurement) equation and a system (evolution) equation . The observation (measurement) equation describes the relationship between the observed\nrandom vectors with mean zero and unknown covariance matrices V t and W t. The DLM defined above amounts to treating ht\nrange level at time t, and at represents the stress range change between time t 1 and t. v t is the zero-mean Gaussian random variable representing the error of measurement at moment t. x1t and x2t are both zero-mean Gaussian random variables representing the evolution of DLM from time t 1 to t. In association with the form of DLM in Equation (1), we haveThe Bayesian forecasting philosophy is based on the description of an observed process using its probability density function (PDF). As implied by the name, the Bayesian forecasting approach commences from Bayes’ theorem, hence enabling the calculation of conditional probabilities. The details of using DLM for the recursive one-step ahead forecasting of the (posterior) distribution of monitoring-derived stress ranges under the Bayesian framework are presented as follows\nNote that in Step 4, Atþ1 is the adaptive coefficient which can be viewed as the information tuner. It scales the correction term according to the relative variances of the prior and likelihood, as measured by Rtþ1=Q tþ1 and regressor value Ftþ1. etþ1 is\nthe one-step forward forecast error, the difference between the observed value ytþ1 and its expectation f tþ1. More details\nabout the recursive one-step ahead forecast method can be found in .3. Defect detection methodologyThe proposed defect detection methodology contains three logical processes: outlier detection, change-point detection,\nand damage assessment. By comparing the real-time measurement with the predicted values, the named outlier detection and change-point detection are devised to determine whether the measurement is a single outlier or the first observation of a remarkable change, the former being executed by calculating the Bayes factor, while the latter being based on the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once a change-point is affirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for further damagePotential outlier detection is the first step in the process of the proposed defect detection approach, accomplished by the Bayes factor calculation. Bayes factor is advocated because of its straightforward and natural interpretation of evidence afforded by data. At every time step t, the Bayesian DLM can yield a PDF for the next measurement, labeled as M0. Meanwhile, an artificial alternative model labeled as M1 is defined by shifting the mean of M0 by +h. The underlying idea of outlier\ndetection is to check the current observation against both M0 and M1. For each time step t, the Bayes factor is the ratio of thewhere yt is the measurement at time t and Dt1 refers to the history information up to time t 1. In the case of Gaussianwhere h is the shift value; yt is the observation value; f t and rt are the mean and standard deviation of the forecasting distribution for observation at time t. A Bayes factor H ¼ 1 indicates that the probability of the observation derived from model M1 is identical to the probability of that derived from Model M0. For better quantitative comparison between any two models, Jeffreys suggested interpreting the Bayes factor as a scale of evidence and provided descriptive statements although\nthe partitions are somewhat arbitrary. According to his suggestion, a Bayes factor can be divided into several intervals for assessing the significance of discrimination: 1 < H < 3 is ‘barely worth mentioning’, 3 < H < 10 is ‘substantial’,\n10 < H < 30 is ‘strong’, 30 < H < 100 is ‘very strong’, and H > 100 is ‘decisive’. In this study, Hmin ¼ 10 is set as a threshold\nAfter the confirmation of Hmin and h, an uncertainty limit (ucl) can be procured by the following equationFor instance, when the confidence level a and threshold of Bayes factor Hmin are set as 90% and 10 respectively, the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt. Thus, an observation is diagnosed as an outlier if its deviation from the mean value of M0 is larger\nWith the Bayes factor defined in Equation (9), only outliers with a positive deviation can be detected. To enable the outliers with negative deviation to be detected as well, a second Bayes factor is defined asIn the automatic monitoring process, both the Bayes factors H1;t and H2;t should be examined in parallel to enable thebehavior, rather than judgments based on long past performances. Change-point is an abrupt variation in time series data,\nrepresenting a transition that occurs between states. Change-point detection aims to detect abrupt change in the generative\nprocess of sequential data. It is assumed that a sequence of observations y1; ; yT could be divided into several nonoverlapping partitions, e.g. dataset j 1, dataset j, and dataset j + 1 as shown in Fig. 2. The delineations between partitions\nare known as change-points (e.g. TOC j 1 and TOC j); the goal of change-point detection is the determination of where the\nboundary of two adjacent partitions is located in a sequence of observations. Change-point detection approaches can be classified into offline and online methods. The former needs to observe the whole sequential observations before aiming to make\ninference on the generative process of the sequence [37–40], wheras the latter aims to update the inference at each time step\nwith the newly acquired measurements from the sequence [41–43]. In particular, the Bayesian online change-point detection methods are based on computing the probability distribution of the run length.differentiate between the single-point outlier and the beginning of a continual change. To overcome this problem, cumulative Bayes factor (local Bayes factors) is recommended to detect change-point(s) in the sequence of observations, by definingwhere lmax is the maximum number of Bayes factors taken into account. Unlike Bayes factor with implicitly no historical influence in the judgement, the consecutive Bayes factors collect evidence of change over a series of observation (from time\net al. . Akin to the Bayes factor threshold for outlier detection, the threshold of maximal cumulative Bayes factors is set as Lmin ¼ 10. If the conditions Lt > Lmin and lt > lmin occur simultaneously, an alarm of change is immediately issued at time t\n(time of notification, TON). The real time of occurrence (TOC) is (t lt þ 1), that is, TOC =t lt þ 1.Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is performed to assess damage extent and quantify the\nassociated uncertainty. The proposed approach directly quantifies the likelihoods of two scenarios (e.g., the sequential observations before and after the change-point), that is, ‘‘no fault” and ‘‘fault”, and the yielded results are easy to interpret. An\nadditional merit of the proposed approach is its ability to quantify the uncertainty in damage detection. Assume that the observed sequential data can be divided into two non-overlapping partitions, the first of which is regarded as healthy\nof the observations. Thus, the damage detection problem becomes the test of H0 : l ¼ l0 versus H1 : l–l0 with\nWith the above, damage detection can be achieved by means of Bayes factor which is defined as the ratio of the probability of observations given the alternate hypothesis to the probability of observations given the null hypothesiswhere D ¼ yf 1; ; yng refers to the observed data. It is proven to bewhere refers to the mean of the observed data fy1; ; yng. If no prior information is available, the initial mean and variance can be set as q ¼ l0 and s ¼ r 0 [][. The two assumptions take the prior mean and variance in the alternative hypothesis as]where z ¼ pfn **f** i ffi l0 0 [ At each time step (i.e.,][ n][=1), the Bayes factor][ B][ is larger for the larger values of][ z][j j][, which is reasonable]and easy to interpret. The logarithm of the Bayes factor, for convenience of comparison among a larger of values, is derived asIf the Bayes factor B10 is larger than 1, the implication is that the observed data provide evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis H1 (i.e., the structure is damaged). Otherwise, the observed data are judged to support the null hypothesis H0 (i.e.,\nthe structure is healthy). As with the previous threshold, B10 10 is set as a threshold for damage indication.\nIntegrating together the outlier detection, change-point detection and damage assessment, the implementation procedures of the proposed methodology are shown in Fig. 3. Beginning at time t, the single Bayes factor is firstly evaluated to\njudge whether yt is an outlier. If not, the maximum cumulative Bayes factor Lt and run length lt for change-point detection are calculated. Once a change-point is detected, the intervention is carried out by resetting the time to the time of occurrence\n(i.e., TOC = t lt þ 1) and by adjusting the mean value of M0 to the observation yt (i.e., f t ¼ yt), and the subsequent analysis\nwill then be started at TOC. Meanwhile, Bayesian hypothesis testing is executed for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification from the current TOC to the next TOC.4. Application to in-service monitoring data of high-speed trainAn onboard monitoring system has been designed and implemented on an in-service high-speed passenger train running on the Lanzhou-Urumqi High-Speed Railway (LUHSR) in China . As shown in Fig. 4, the monitoring system is composed\nof a total of 52 FBG strain sensors, 4 FBG temperature sensors, 11 accelerometers (tri-axial) and 1 noise sensor deployed on both motor and trailer bogies. Also, one tri-axial FBG accelerometer, one video camera and two GPS sensors are installed inside a train carriage. As the present work is focused on the real-time detection of potentially defective wheels by using strain monitoring data from bogies, only the deployment of strain sensors is concerned. The strain sensors are mounted\non 4 measurement zones of the bogies: (i) the zone with the action of high loads; (ii) the stress transmission zone; (iii)\nthe zone with high responses predicted by finite element analysis; and (iv) welded joints. FBG strain (and temperature) sensors are deployed and attached to the surface of the train bogie with industrial glue and tapes, and connected to the interrogator (data logger) with laptop inside the train carriage through optical fiber cables.\nThe data utilized in this study were obtained from a monitoring schedule spanning 18 days as shown in Table 1. The total length of the LUHSR between Lanzhou and Urumqi is 1777 km. In the trip from Lanzhou to Urumqi, the high-speed train\nstops by 14 stations and travels cross 13 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 13th); in trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou, the high-speed train stops by 15 stations and travels cross 14 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 14th). During the monitoring\nperiod, the train operated at its normal speed around 200–250 km/h. The sampling rate for all the sensors was set at 5000\nSince the train wheels were lathed (lathing is a process to make wheels perfectly rounded) during the monitoring period,\nthe recorded data contain information in line with two different states (before lathing and after lathing). The wheels can be considered as potentially unhealthy (defective) before lathing and as healthy after lathing. To verify the effectiveness of theproposed real-time defect detection methodology, the strain monitoring data obtained from the bogies before and afterThe train’s dynamic responses may be influenced by different subgrade conditions of the railroad, such as ground, tunnel,\nand bridge. To eliminate the effects of different railroad conditions, the strain data recorded from the same railroad sectionbefore and after lathing, are used in each scenario. In addition, the passenger loads in different trips are deemed statistically identical and the speed of train is assumed to be constant as in normal operation. Without loss of generality, the monitoring\ndata respectively obtained from two typical railroad sections (1st and 14th) in the trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou are chosen to illustrate the proposed real-time defect detection methodology, which are from the strain gauge (MS3-7) deployed at the For the sake of brevity, the monitoring data collected from the 1st railroad section are denoted as Case 1, while those from the 14th railroad section are denoted as Case 2. Firstly, the measured strain is converted to stress for the subsequent stress\nrange calculation. For the strain gauges mounted on the steel surface, the conversion of the measured strain to stress is made by rs ¼ Ee, where E is the elasticity modulus of steel and e is the strain after eliminating the effect of varying temperatures.where em is the measured strain, T m is the measured temperature in the vicinity of the strain sensor, T 0 is the temperature at\nthe installation, and a1 is a constant coefficient. In our case, the original temperature is 4, i.e., T 0 ¼ 4. The results of temperature compensation are demonstrated in Fig. 5. It is obvious that the trend in strain responses caused by temperature\nAfterwards, the stress ranges are extracted from the monitoring-derived stress data by the application of the rainflow\ncounting algorithm. From each stress cycle, the stress range Sa is obtained by calculating the difference between the maximum stress rmax and the minimum stress rmin measured in that stress cycle, i.e., Sa ¼ rmax rmin. More details on the stress ranges extraction are given in . The stress ranges with amplitudes lower than 1 MPa need to be culled because the majority are caused by noise. To decrease the uncertainty arising from the measurement facilities, the average stress ranges for\nevery ten minutes are used as the target quantities. Due to the different lengths of the two selected railroad sections (1st and 14th), the traveling time of the train in each section is also different. This results in different data lengths. The data\nlengths of the average stress ranges in Case 1 and Case 2 are 110 and 90, respectively. Figs. and 7 show the original measured strain responses before and after lathing in Case 1 and Case 2, respectively.Following the implementation procedures mentioned before, the defect detection results for Case 1 are demonstrated in\nFigs. and 9. Fig. 8(a) shows the average stress range (red point) together with 1-step ahead prediction (blue solid line) and\nthe corresponding 90% prediction interval (grey shadow). It is observed that, although some observations at the time interval t 2 fall outside the 90% prediction interval, only the Bayes factor at time t ¼ 55 exceeds the established threshold of Hmin ¼ 10 as shown in Fig. 9(a). It is thus judged as an outlier (marked as h). The reason is that because when applying the proposed approach, the shift parameter is set as h ¼ 1:645rt, resulting in the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt while the other\nfour observations are still within the uncertainty limit. On the other hand, Fig. 9(b)–(c) shows the results of the maximum cumulative Bayes factor and the corresponding run length for change detection. It is seen that the maximum cumulative\nBayes factor values at time instants t ¼ 56; 57 and 58 are larger than the threshold of Lmin ¼ 10, while merely the run length at instant t ¼ 58 surpasses the threshold of lmin ¼ 4. Apparently, this observation at time t ¼ 58 fulfills the conditions of change-point detection causing an alarm to be issued (i.e., TON ¼ 58). The identified real occurrence time of change-point is t ¼ 55 (i.e., TOC ¼ 58 4 þ 1 ¼ 55), which coincides well with the actual time point of lathing the wheels. In accordance\nwith the real-time identification of change-point occurrence, the prediction model is refined by altering the guessed mean\nvalue at TOC, as shown in Fig. 8(b). The predictions near TOC in the refined model obviously agree well with the actual observations, thus offering a better prediction performance than that of the original model.\nThe results of defect detection by means of Bayesian hypothesis testing are illustrated in Fig. 9(d). The discrimination between ‘‘healthy” and ‘‘defective” is quantified by the logarithm value of Bayes factor. It is seen from Fig. 9(d) that the vast\nmajority of logarithm values of Bayes factor before TOC are nearly zero and below the threshold level (dotted red line), which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘healthy state” (no defect). This is consistent with the actual health condition and thus validatesthe capability of the Bayesian hypothesis testing. On the contrary, all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than 2, meaning that the corresponding Bayes factor values exceed 100. According to the classification of Bayes factor stipulated in Sub-section 3.1, this result (H > 100) favors the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity is classified as ‘‘decisive”. Indeed, wheels immediately before being sent to depot for lathing were in the state of ‘heavily defective’.\nMaking use of Eq. (21), the probabilities of damage after TOC are obtained as 100%, that is, the wheels are identified as defective with a very high confidence.\nThe defect detection results for Case 2 are similar to Case 1, and are illustrated in Figs. and 11. As seen in Fig. 11(a)–(c)\nno outlier exists throughout the whole period, but a change-point is identified, of which the time of notification is t ¼ 44 (i.e.,\nTON ¼ 44) and the real time of occurrence is t ¼ 41 (i.e., TOC ¼ 44 4 þ 1 ¼ 41). The result matches well with the actual time point when wheel lathing is inflicted. For the predictions near the change-point, the modified prediction model\n(Fig. 10(b)) offers a better performance than the original model (Fig. 10(a)). As illustrated in Fig. 11(d), all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than the threshold (dotted red line), whereas the values before TOC are within thethreshold line. The values of Bayes factor after TOC are obtained to be higher than 100 (H > 100) and the corresponding probabilities of damage are approximately 100%, which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity\nApart from the accuracy of the proposed approach, the computational efficiency is also of concern. The algorithmic implementation is performed on a Lenovo ThinkCentre M720t desktop (Lenovo, Beijing, China) with Dual Intel Core i7-8700 processor (Intel, California, USA) and 24 GB of memory. The computation times consumed in Case 1 and Case 2 are 4.0109 s and\n3.7704 s respectively. In this sense, it realizes the detection of wheel defects in real time.5. ConclusionsA novel methodology for real-time defect detection of high-speed train wheels using Bayesian forecasting and dynamic linear model (DLM) has been developed and validated in this study. First, the DLM is formulated to approximate the actual\nframework. Afterwards, three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) are elicited for outlier detection and change-point detection. After the change-point has been confirmed, damage assessment is executed by the Bayesian hypothesis testing of the sequential observations before and after the change-point. Due to accommodating the dynamic evolution process and the statistical nature of the method, the proposed approach not only possesses the ability of real-time damage detection, but also enables damage quantification (through classifying the range of Bayes factor) and uncertainty assessment (through calculating the probability of damage). The methodology is illustrated by using the onlinelathing). In the two cases addressed, wheel defects are successfully identified, hence validating the effectiveness of the developed method. The quantitative results about the damage extent and confidence would provide useful information helping to\nmake cost-effective, risk-based decisions with the aim of maintaining the operation safety of high-speed rail.\nDespite the proposed methodology being developed for wheel defect detection of high-speed trains, it can also be applied to low-speed passenger and freight trains as well as extended to SHM for a wide variety of civil infrastructure (e.g., bridges,\nbuildings and tunnels) when vibration signals are available via monitoring. In this study, the second-order polynomial DLM\nis employed to model the stress ranges, which only considers the change of stress range level and trend. However, most longterm SHM data, especially long-term strain monitoring data, are generally contaminated by trend, seasonal (cyclical) and\nregression effects, which require a more complex model. The Bayesian DLM enables the modeling of time-dependent responses of a structure by integrating appropriate components, for instance, the response with cyclical characteristics\ncan be depicted by embedding a seasonal (cyclical) component. Thus, in accordance with the nature of monitoring data,\nan appropriate Bayesian DLM enabling to describe time series data of different features, can be formulated for damage detection of a variety of structures subject to different operational/environmental conditions.Administrative Region, China (Project No. PolyU 152024/17E).

IntroductionHigh-speed rail (HSR) is being developed in Asian and European countries to satisfy the rapidly growing demand for intercity services and to shore up economic growth. The rapid\ngrowth of HSR, however, has posed great challenges regarding operation safety, reliability\nand ride comfort. Irregular wheel defects can induce high-magnitude impact forces hindering safety and ride comfort of HSR and may also cause damage to rail tracks and vehicles.real time. The proposed methodology embraces logics for (i) prognosis, (ii) potential outlier\ndetection, (iii) identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and (iv) quantification of damage extent and uncertainty. Relying on the strain monitoring data acquired from high-speed train bogies, the Bayesian DLM for characterizing the actual stress ranges is established, by which one-step forecast distribution is elicited before proceeding to the\nnext observation. The detection of change-point is executed by comparing the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM) and an alternative model\n(the mean value is shifted by a prescribed offset) to determine which better fits the actual observation. If the comparison results are in favor of the alternative model, it is claimed that a potential change has occurred. Whether such an observation is an outlier or the beginning of a genuine change (change-point), three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum\ncumulative Bayes factor and run length) are performed for further identification.

Rail accidents were occasionally caused by failures such as severe defects or fatigue of railway components. To maintain a good service quality and operation safety, it is paramount to develop\nonline monitoring techniques that not only quickly recognize faults of mission-critical HSR components but also can anticipate of long-term mechanisms and gradual deterioration in performance.\nWheelsets in a high-speed train are physically connected with and controlled by the bogie system which corrects alignment for stable running and reduces the vibration caused by wheel-rail interaction . However, the wheel performance\nprogressively deteriorates in different mechanisms (e.g., wheel flat and wheel polygonization) during the routine operation of a high-speed train . Wheel performance deterioration increases stresses experienced by the bogie system. In addition,\nthe increased stress within bogie frames caused by wheel quality deterioration can be unexpectedly large, thus posing a serious threat to the operation safety of concerned trains. According to the statistics of train accidents caused by failure in\nmechanical components during 2004 to 2007 in the United States, the wheelsets faults are the most cause with a rate of\n44.7% . Therefore, the railway managers are keen to keep wheels in an adequate condition and detect potential failure\nas soon as possible. For railway wheels, there are three different ways of estimating the conditions: physical modeling, statistical modeling and condition monitoring . However, the first two ways are not applicable to in-service\nwheel condition assessment, and in contrast, the third way is most feasible for wheel condition estimation. The monitoring approaches available to wheel defect detection can be divided into in-workshop inspection and in-service detection . The\nlatter provides the real-time data required for maintenance planning, while the former is normally carried out at workshops at fixed intervals. The commonly used in-workshop methods for wheel defect inspection include the ultrasonic techniques, infrared camera and magnetic methods . In-service monitoring approaches can be categorized as on-board and wayside methods. The on-board methods implement sensors on the train and continuously obtain comprehensive data from\nthe system. The methods of this category include magnetic technique , ultrasonic technique , acoustic technique, and vibration technique . On the other hand, wayside methods attempt to detect the wheel or vehicle performance\nby installing sensors on the rail or its surrounding areas. Such indirect measurements give rise to limited information of the wheel condition while they can monitor all train wheels going by with using only one or a few sensors. According to the type\nof sensors used, wayside detection approaches include strain sensing technology , fiber optic sensing technology ,\nultrasonic technique , vibration technique , acoustic emission , lasers and high-speed cameras . However,\nthe study on data interpretation techniques enabling the extraction of defect-sensitive features is far from sufficient.\nBayesian dynamic linear model (DLM) is an elegant system approach to handling time series data from a Bayesian perspective, which originates from the field of applied statistics and is extensively used in other fields such as economics\nand engineering [25–30]. The Bayesian DLM treats the time series as the output of a dynamic system perturbed by random disturbances. It is suitable for modeling both univariate and multivariate time series, and also for representing the structural changes, non-stationarity and irregular patterns . Unlike the classical time series method which assumes a fixed relationship between the dependent variables (response variables) and the independent variables (regressors), the DLM considers\nthe relationship changes over time and is able to directly capture time series data features, such as trend, seasonality,\nand regression effects. Moreover, the DLM allows for descriptions of temporary or permanent shifts in time series parameters that occur abruptly, which are necessary for outlier and damage detection in structural health monitoring (SHM) paradigms. Recently, Goulet and his collaborator adopted the Bayesian DLM theory in SHM to model the time-dependent\nresponses of structures by breaking them into subcomponents. In the perspective of real-time damage detection, only few studies are available. The first attempt was conducted by Lipowsky et al. with the development of a Bayesian DLM-based\nreal-time detection algorithm to evaluate the performance of a gas turbine using simulated data. Later on, Wang et al.\nand Zhang et al. adopted the above algorithm for detecting high-speed train defects by using real-world monitoring\ndata. In the previous studies, however, the real-time detection algorithm devised possesses only outlier identification and\nchange detection abilities, without the function of damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.context of Bayesian DLM, which incorporates logics for prognosis, potential outlier detection, identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and damage extent and uncertainty quantification. The Bayesian DLM is considered as a tool\nfor time series analysis, while Bayesian forecasting is executed to enable the calculation of one-step ahead forecast distribution. The change-point detection is performed by checking the current observation against the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM for current instant) as well as against an alternative model of which the mean value\nis shifted by a prescribed offset. The detection rule is that if the alternative model better fits the actual observation, a potential change is signaled. To further determine whether such an observation is only an outlier or the beginning of an actual\nchange (change-point), a specific logic is developed by introducing the Bayes factor and the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.\nThe main contributions of this study are the provision of: (i) a formula which not only enables the modeling of actual framework; (ii) three metrics (i.e., the Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) to allow for outlier\nand change-point detection in real-time manner; and (iii) an efficient way for damage extent assessment and uncertainty\nquantification. The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the Bayesian DLM theory and an elaboration of the Bayesian forecasting philosophy. Section 3 presents the defect detection methodology that incorporates logics for\noutlier detection, change-point identification, and damage assessment. In Section 4, two case studies making use of timeseries strain data acquired by fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors affixed on the bogies of an in-service high-speed train are offered to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the proposed methodology. Finally, conclusions are drawn in2. Bayesian DLM and forecastingThe Bayesian DLM is a kind of process-based Bayesian prediction model which provides a flexible way to intuitively capture how processes evolve over time. It consists of two basic equations: an observation (measurement) equation and a system (evolution) equation . The observation (measurement) equation describes the relationship between the observed\nrandom vectors with mean zero and unknown covariance matrices V t and W t. The DLM defined above amounts to treating ht\nrange level at time t, and at represents the stress range change between time t 1 and t. v t is the zero-mean Gaussian random variable representing the error of measurement at moment t. x1t and x2t are both zero-mean Gaussian random variables representing the evolution of DLM from time t 1 to t. In association with the form of DLM in Equation (1), we haveThe Bayesian forecasting philosophy is based on the description of an observed process using its probability density function (PDF). As implied by the name, the Bayesian forecasting approach commences from Bayes’ theorem, hence enabling the calculation of conditional probabilities. The details of using DLM for the recursive one-step ahead forecasting of the (posterior) distribution of monitoring-derived stress ranges under the Bayesian framework are presented as follows\nNote that in Step 4, Atþ1 is the adaptive coefficient which can be viewed as the information tuner. It scales the correction term according to the relative variances of the prior and likelihood, as measured by Rtþ1=Q tþ1 and regressor value Ftþ1. etþ1 is\nthe one-step forward forecast error, the difference between the observed value ytþ1 and its expectation f tþ1. More details\nabout the recursive one-step ahead forecast method can be found in .3. Defect detection methodologyThe proposed defect detection methodology contains three logical processes: outlier detection, change-point detection,\nand damage assessment. By comparing the real-time measurement with the predicted values, the named outlier detection and change-point detection are devised to determine whether the measurement is a single outlier or the first observation of a remarkable change, the former being executed by calculating the Bayes factor, while the latter being based on the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once a change-point is affirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for further damagePotential outlier detection is the first step in the process of the proposed defect detection approach, accomplished by the Bayes factor calculation. Bayes factor is advocated because of its straightforward and natural interpretation of evidence afforded by data. At every time step t, the Bayesian DLM can yield a PDF for the next measurement, labeled as M0. Meanwhile, an artificial alternative model labeled as M1 is defined by shifting the mean of M0 by +h. The underlying idea of outlier\ndetection is to check the current observation against both M0 and M1. For each time step t, the Bayes factor is the ratio of thewhere yt is the measurement at time t and Dt1 refers to the history information up to time t 1. In the case of Gaussianwhere h is the shift value; yt is the observation value; f t and rt are the mean and standard deviation of the forecasting distribution for observation at time t. A Bayes factor H ¼ 1 indicates that the probability of the observation derived from model M1 is identical to the probability of that derived from Model M0. For better quantitative comparison between any two models, Jeffreys suggested interpreting the Bayes factor as a scale of evidence and provided descriptive statements although\nthe partitions are somewhat arbitrary. According to his suggestion, a Bayes factor can be divided into several intervals for assessing the significance of discrimination: 1 < H < 3 is ‘barely worth mentioning’, 3 < H < 10 is ‘substantial’,\n10 < H < 30 is ‘strong’, 30 < H < 100 is ‘very strong’, and H > 100 is ‘decisive’. In this study, Hmin ¼ 10 is set as a threshold\nAfter the confirmation of Hmin and h, an uncertainty limit (ucl) can be procured by the following equationFor instance, when the confidence level a and threshold of Bayes factor Hmin are set as 90% and 10 respectively, the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt. Thus, an observation is diagnosed as an outlier if its deviation from the mean value of M0 is larger\nWith the Bayes factor defined in Equation (9), only outliers with a positive deviation can be detected. To enable the outliers with negative deviation to be detected as well, a second Bayes factor is defined asIn the automatic monitoring process, both the Bayes factors H1;t and H2;t should be examined in parallel to enable thebehavior, rather than judgments based on long past performances. Change-point is an abrupt variation in time series data,\nrepresenting a transition that occurs between states. Change-point detection aims to detect abrupt change in the generative\nprocess of sequential data. It is assumed that a sequence of observations y1; ; yT could be divided into several nonoverlapping partitions, e.g. dataset j 1, dataset j, and dataset j + 1 as shown in Fig. 2. The delineations between partitions\nare known as change-points (e.g. TOC j 1 and TOC j); the goal of change-point detection is the determination of where the\nboundary of two adjacent partitions is located in a sequence of observations. Change-point detection approaches can be classified into offline and online methods. The former needs to observe the whole sequential observations before aiming to make\ninference on the generative process of the sequence [37–40], wheras the latter aims to update the inference at each time step\nwith the newly acquired measurements from the sequence [41–43]. In particular, the Bayesian online change-point detection methods are based on computing the probability distribution of the run length.differentiate between the single-point outlier and the beginning of a continual change. To overcome this problem, cumulative Bayes factor (local Bayes factors) is recommended to detect change-point(s) in the sequence of observations, by definingwhere lmax is the maximum number of Bayes factors taken into account. Unlike Bayes factor with implicitly no historical influence in the judgement, the consecutive Bayes factors collect evidence of change over a series of observation (from time\net al. . Akin to the Bayes factor threshold for outlier detection, the threshold of maximal cumulative Bayes factors is set as Lmin ¼ 10. If the conditions Lt > Lmin and lt > lmin occur simultaneously, an alarm of change is immediately issued at time t\n(time of notification, TON). The real time of occurrence (TOC) is (t lt þ 1), that is, TOC =t lt þ 1.Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is performed to assess damage extent and quantify the\nassociated uncertainty. The proposed approach directly quantifies the likelihoods of two scenarios (e.g., the sequential observations before and after the change-point), that is, ‘‘no fault” and ‘‘fault”, and the yielded results are easy to interpret. An\nadditional merit of the proposed approach is its ability to quantify the uncertainty in damage detection. Assume that the observed sequential data can be divided into two non-overlapping partitions, the first of which is regarded as healthy\nof the observations. Thus, the damage detection problem becomes the test of H0 : l ¼ l0 versus H1 : l–l0 with\nWith the above, damage detection can be achieved by means of Bayes factor which is defined as the ratio of the probability of observations given the alternate hypothesis to the probability of observations given the null hypothesiswhere D ¼ yf 1; ; yng refers to the observed data. It is proven to bewhere refers to the mean of the observed data fy1; ; yng. If no prior information is available, the initial mean and variance can be set as q ¼ l0 and s ¼ r 0 [][. The two assumptions take the prior mean and variance in the alternative hypothesis as]where z ¼ pfn **f** i ffi l0 0 [ At each time step (i.e.,][ n][=1), the Bayes factor][ B][ is larger for the larger values of][ z][j j][, which is reasonable]and easy to interpret. The logarithm of the Bayes factor, for convenience of comparison among a larger of values, is derived asIf the Bayes factor B10 is larger than 1, the implication is that the observed data provide evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis H1 (i.e., the structure is damaged). Otherwise, the observed data are judged to support the null hypothesis H0 (i.e.,\nthe structure is healthy). As with the previous threshold, B10 10 is set as a threshold for damage indication.\nIntegrating together the outlier detection, change-point detection and damage assessment, the implementation procedures of the proposed methodology are shown in Fig. 3. Beginning at time t, the single Bayes factor is firstly evaluated to\njudge whether yt is an outlier. If not, the maximum cumulative Bayes factor Lt and run length lt for change-point detection are calculated. Once a change-point is detected, the intervention is carried out by resetting the time to the time of occurrence\n(i.e., TOC = t lt þ 1) and by adjusting the mean value of M0 to the observation yt (i.e., f t ¼ yt), and the subsequent analysis\nwill then be started at TOC. Meanwhile, Bayesian hypothesis testing is executed for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification from the current TOC to the next TOC.4. Application to in-service monitoring data of high-speed trainAn onboard monitoring system has been designed and implemented on an in-service high-speed passenger train running on the Lanzhou-Urumqi High-Speed Railway (LUHSR) in China . As shown in Fig. 4, the monitoring system is composed\nof a total of 52 FBG strain sensors, 4 FBG temperature sensors, 11 accelerometers (tri-axial) and 1 noise sensor deployed on both motor and trailer bogies. Also, one tri-axial FBG accelerometer, one video camera and two GPS sensors are installed inside a train carriage. As the present work is focused on the real-time detection of potentially defective wheels by using strain monitoring data from bogies, only the deployment of strain sensors is concerned. The strain sensors are mounted\non 4 measurement zones of the bogies: (i) the zone with the action of high loads; (ii) the stress transmission zone; (iii)\nthe zone with high responses predicted by finite element analysis; and (iv) welded joints. FBG strain (and temperature) sensors are deployed and attached to the surface of the train bogie with industrial glue and tapes, and connected to the interrogator (data logger) with laptop inside the train carriage through optical fiber cables.\nThe data utilized in this study were obtained from a monitoring schedule spanning 18 days as shown in Table 1. The total length of the LUHSR between Lanzhou and Urumqi is 1777 km. In the trip from Lanzhou to Urumqi, the high-speed train\nstops by 14 stations and travels cross 13 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 13th); in trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou, the high-speed train stops by 15 stations and travels cross 14 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 14th). During the monitoring\nperiod, the train operated at its normal speed around 200–250 km/h. The sampling rate for all the sensors was set at 5000\nSince the train wheels were lathed (lathing is a process to make wheels perfectly rounded) during the monitoring period,\nthe recorded data contain information in line with two different states (before lathing and after lathing). The wheels can be considered as potentially unhealthy (defective) before lathing and as healthy after lathing. To verify the effectiveness of theproposed real-time defect detection methodology, the strain monitoring data obtained from the bogies before and afterThe train’s dynamic responses may be influenced by different subgrade conditions of the railroad, such as ground, tunnel,\nand bridge. To eliminate the effects of different railroad conditions, the strain data recorded from the same railroad sectionbefore and after lathing, are used in each scenario. In addition, the passenger loads in different trips are deemed statistically identical and the speed of train is assumed to be constant as in normal operation. Without loss of generality, the monitoring\ndata respectively obtained from two typical railroad sections (1st and 14th) in the trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou are chosen to illustrate the proposed real-time defect detection methodology, which are from the strain gauge (MS3-7) deployed at the For the sake of brevity, the monitoring data collected from the 1st railroad section are denoted as Case 1, while those from the 14th railroad section are denoted as Case 2. Firstly, the measured strain is converted to stress for the subsequent stress\nrange calculation. For the strain gauges mounted on the steel surface, the conversion of the measured strain to stress is made by rs ¼ Ee, where E is the elasticity modulus of steel and e is the strain after eliminating the effect of varying temperatures.where em is the measured strain, T m is the measured temperature in the vicinity of the strain sensor, T 0 is the temperature at\nthe installation, and a1 is a constant coefficient. In our case, the original temperature is 4, i.e., T 0 ¼ 4. The results of temperature compensation are demonstrated in Fig. 5. It is obvious that the trend in strain responses caused by temperature\nAfterwards, the stress ranges are extracted from the monitoring-derived stress data by the application of the rainflow\ncounting algorithm. From each stress cycle, the stress range Sa is obtained by calculating the difference between the maximum stress rmax and the minimum stress rmin measured in that stress cycle, i.e., Sa ¼ rmax rmin. More details on the stress ranges extraction are given in . The stress ranges with amplitudes lower than 1 MPa need to be culled because the majority are caused by noise. To decrease the uncertainty arising from the measurement facilities, the average stress ranges for\nevery ten minutes are used as the target quantities. Due to the different lengths of the two selected railroad sections (1st and 14th), the traveling time of the train in each section is also different. This results in different data lengths. The data\nlengths of the average stress ranges in Case 1 and Case 2 are 110 and 90, respectively. Figs. and 7 show the original measured strain responses before and after lathing in Case 1 and Case 2, respectively.Following the implementation procedures mentioned before, the defect detection results for Case 1 are demonstrated in\nFigs. and 9. Fig. 8(a) shows the average stress range (red point) together with 1-step ahead prediction (blue solid line) and\nthe corresponding 90% prediction interval (grey shadow). It is observed that, although some observations at the time interval t 2 fall outside the 90% prediction interval, only the Bayes factor at time t ¼ 55 exceeds the established threshold of Hmin ¼ 10 as shown in Fig. 9(a). It is thus judged as an outlier (marked as h). The reason is that because when applying the proposed approach, the shift parameter is set as h ¼ 1:645rt, resulting in the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt while the other\nfour observations are still within the uncertainty limit. On the other hand, Fig. 9(b)–(c) shows the results of the maximum cumulative Bayes factor and the corresponding run length for change detection. It is seen that the maximum cumulative\nBayes factor values at time instants t ¼ 56; 57 and 58 are larger than the threshold of Lmin ¼ 10, while merely the run length at instant t ¼ 58 surpasses the threshold of lmin ¼ 4. Apparently, this observation at time t ¼ 58 fulfills the conditions of change-point detection causing an alarm to be issued (i.e., TON ¼ 58). The identified real occurrence time of change-point is t ¼ 55 (i.e., TOC ¼ 58 4 þ 1 ¼ 55), which coincides well with the actual time point of lathing the wheels. In accordance\nwith the real-time identification of change-point occurrence, the prediction model is refined by altering the guessed mean\nvalue at TOC, as shown in Fig. 8(b). The predictions near TOC in the refined model obviously agree well with the actual observations, thus offering a better prediction performance than that of the original model.\nThe results of defect detection by means of Bayesian hypothesis testing are illustrated in Fig. 9(d). The discrimination between ‘‘healthy” and ‘‘defective” is quantified by the logarithm value of Bayes factor. It is seen from Fig. 9(d) that the vast\nmajority of logarithm values of Bayes factor before TOC are nearly zero and below the threshold level (dotted red line), which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘healthy state” (no defect). This is consistent with the actual health condition and thus validatesthe capability of the Bayesian hypothesis testing. On the contrary, all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than 2, meaning that the corresponding Bayes factor values exceed 100. According to the classification of Bayes factor stipulated in Sub-section 3.1, this result (H > 100) favors the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity is classified as ‘‘decisive”. Indeed, wheels immediately before being sent to depot for lathing were in the state of ‘heavily defective’.\nMaking use of Eq. (21), the probabilities of damage after TOC are obtained as 100%, that is, the wheels are identified as defective with a very high confidence.\nThe defect detection results for Case 2 are similar to Case 1, and are illustrated in Figs. and 11. As seen in Fig. 11(a)–(c)\nno outlier exists throughout the whole period, but a change-point is identified, of which the time of notification is t ¼ 44 (i.e.,\nTON ¼ 44) and the real time of occurrence is t ¼ 41 (i.e., TOC ¼ 44 4 þ 1 ¼ 41). The result matches well with the actual time point when wheel lathing is inflicted. For the predictions near the change-point, the modified prediction model\n(Fig. 10(b)) offers a better performance than the original model (Fig. 10(a)). As illustrated in Fig. 11(d), all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than the threshold (dotted red line), whereas the values before TOC are within thethreshold line. The values of Bayes factor after TOC are obtained to be higher than 100 (H > 100) and the corresponding probabilities of damage are approximately 100%, which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity\nApart from the accuracy of the proposed approach, the computational efficiency is also of concern. The algorithmic implementation is performed on a Lenovo ThinkCentre M720t desktop (Lenovo, Beijing, China) with Dual Intel Core i7-8700 processor (Intel, California, USA) and 24 GB of memory. The computation times consumed in Case 1 and Case 2 are 4.0109 s and\n3.7704 s respectively. In this sense, it realizes the detection of wheel defects in real time.5. ConclusionsA novel methodology for real-time defect detection of high-speed train wheels using Bayesian forecasting and dynamic linear model (DLM) has been developed and validated in this study. First, the DLM is formulated to approximate the actual\nframework. Afterwards, three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) are elicited for outlier detection and change-point detection. After the change-point has been confirmed, damage assessment is executed by the Bayesian hypothesis testing of the sequential observations before and after the change-point. Due to accommodating the dynamic evolution process and the statistical nature of the method, the proposed approach not only possesses the ability of real-time damage detection, but also enables damage quantification (through classifying the range of Bayes factor) and uncertainty assessment (through calculating the probability of damage). The methodology is illustrated by using the onlinelathing). In the two cases addressed, wheel defects are successfully identified, hence validating the effectiveness of the developed method. The quantitative results about the damage extent and confidence would provide useful information helping to\nmake cost-effective, risk-based decisions with the aim of maintaining the operation safety of high-speed rail.\nDespite the proposed methodology being developed for wheel defect detection of high-speed trains, it can also be applied to low-speed passenger and freight trains as well as extended to SHM for a wide variety of civil infrastructure (e.g., bridges,\nbuildings and tunnels) when vibration signals are available via monitoring. In this study, the second-order polynomial DLM\nis employed to model the stress ranges, which only considers the change of stress range level and trend. However, most longterm SHM data, especially long-term strain monitoring data, are generally contaminated by trend, seasonal (cyclical) and\nregression effects, which require a more complex model. The Bayesian DLM enables the modeling of time-dependent responses of a structure by integrating appropriate components, for instance, the response with cyclical characteristics\ncan be depicted by embedding a seasonal (cyclical) component. Thus, in accordance with the nature of monitoring data,\nan appropriate Bayesian DLM enabling to describe time series data of different features, can be formulated for damage detection of a variety of structures subject to different operational/environmental conditions.Administrative Region, China (Project No. PolyU 152024/17E).

The rapid\ngrowth of HSR, however, has posed great challenges regarding operation safety, reliability\nand ride comfort. Irregular wheel defects can induce high-magnitude impact forces hindering safety and ride comfort of HSR and may also cause damage to rail tracks and vehicles.real time. The proposed methodology embraces logics for (i) prognosis, (ii) potential outlier\ndetection, (iii) identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and (iv) quantification of damage extent and uncertainty. Relying on the strain monitoring data acquired from high-speed train bogies, the Bayesian DLM for characterizing the actual stress ranges is established, by which one-step forecast distribution is elicited before proceeding to the\nnext observation. The detection of change-point is executed by comparing the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM) and an alternative model\n(the mean value is shifted by a prescribed offset) to determine which better fits the actual observation. If the comparison results are in favor of the alternative model, it is claimed that a potential change has occurred. Whether such an observation is an outlier or the beginning of a genuine change (change-point), three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum\ncumulative Bayes factor and run length) are performed for further identification.

Rail accidents were occasionally caused by failures such as severe defects or fatigue of railway components. To maintain a good service quality and operation safety, it is paramount to develop\nonline monitoring techniques that not only quickly recognize faults of mission-critical HSR components but also can anticipate of long-term mechanisms and gradual deterioration in performance.\nWheelsets in a high-speed train are physically connected with and controlled by the bogie system which corrects alignment for stable running and reduces the vibration caused by wheel-rail interaction . However, the wheel performance\nprogressively deteriorates in different mechanisms (e.g., wheel flat and wheel polygonization) during the routine operation of a high-speed train . Wheel performance deterioration increases stresses experienced by the bogie system. In addition,\nthe increased stress within bogie frames caused by wheel quality deterioration can be unexpectedly large, thus posing a serious threat to the operation safety of concerned trains. According to the statistics of train accidents caused by failure in\nmechanical components during 2004 to 2007 in the United States, the wheelsets faults are the most cause with a rate of\n44.7% . Therefore, the railway managers are keen to keep wheels in an adequate condition and detect potential failure\nas soon as possible. For railway wheels, there are three different ways of estimating the conditions: physical modeling, statistical modeling and condition monitoring . However, the first two ways are not applicable to in-service\nwheel condition assessment, and in contrast, the third way is most feasible for wheel condition estimation. The monitoring approaches available to wheel defect detection can be divided into in-workshop inspection and in-service detection . The\nlatter provides the real-time data required for maintenance planning, while the former is normally carried out at workshops at fixed intervals. The commonly used in-workshop methods for wheel defect inspection include the ultrasonic techniques, infrared camera and magnetic methods . In-service monitoring approaches can be categorized as on-board and wayside methods. The on-board methods implement sensors on the train and continuously obtain comprehensive data from\nthe system. The methods of this category include magnetic technique , ultrasonic technique , acoustic technique, and vibration technique . On the other hand, wayside methods attempt to detect the wheel or vehicle performance\nby installing sensors on the rail or its surrounding areas. Such indirect measurements give rise to limited information of the wheel condition while they can monitor all train wheels going by with using only one or a few sensors. According to the type\nof sensors used, wayside detection approaches include strain sensing technology , fiber optic sensing technology ,\nultrasonic technique , vibration technique , acoustic emission , lasers and high-speed cameras . However,\nthe study on data interpretation techniques enabling the extraction of defect-sensitive features is far from sufficient.\nBayesian dynamic linear model (DLM) is an elegant system approach to handling time series data from a Bayesian perspective, which originates from the field of applied statistics and is extensively used in other fields such as economics\nand engineering [25–30]. The Bayesian DLM treats the time series as the output of a dynamic system perturbed by random disturbances. It is suitable for modeling both univariate and multivariate time series, and also for representing the structural changes, non-stationarity and irregular patterns . Unlike the classical time series method which assumes a fixed relationship between the dependent variables (response variables) and the independent variables (regressors), the DLM considers\nthe relationship changes over time and is able to directly capture time series data features, such as trend, seasonality,\nand regression effects. Moreover, the DLM allows for descriptions of temporary or permanent shifts in time series parameters that occur abruptly, which are necessary for outlier and damage detection in structural health monitoring (SHM) paradigms. Recently, Goulet and his collaborator adopted the Bayesian DLM theory in SHM to model the time-dependent\nresponses of structures by breaking them into subcomponents. In the perspective of real-time damage detection, only few studies are available. The first attempt was conducted by Lipowsky et al. with the development of a Bayesian DLM-based\nreal-time detection algorithm to evaluate the performance of a gas turbine using simulated data. Later on, Wang et al.\nand Zhang et al. adopted the above algorithm for detecting high-speed train defects by using real-world monitoring\ndata. In the previous studies, however, the real-time detection algorithm devised possesses only outlier identification and\nchange detection abilities, without the function of damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.context of Bayesian DLM, which incorporates logics for prognosis, potential outlier detection, identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and damage extent and uncertainty quantification. The Bayesian DLM is considered as a tool\nfor time series analysis, while Bayesian forecasting is executed to enable the calculation of one-step ahead forecast distribution. The change-point detection is performed by checking the current observation against the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM for current instant) as well as against an alternative model of which the mean value\nis shifted by a prescribed offset. The detection rule is that if the alternative model better fits the actual observation, a potential change is signaled. To further determine whether such an observation is only an outlier or the beginning of an actual\nchange (change-point), a specific logic is developed by introducing the Bayes factor and the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.\nThe main contributions of this study are the provision of: (i) a formula which not only enables the modeling of actual framework; (ii) three metrics (i.e., the Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) to allow for outlier\nand change-point detection in real-time manner; and (iii) an efficient way for damage extent assessment and uncertainty\nquantification. The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the Bayesian DLM theory and an elaboration of the Bayesian forecasting philosophy. Section 3 presents the defect detection methodology that incorporates logics for\noutlier detection, change-point identification, and damage assessment. In Section 4, two case studies making use of timeseries strain data acquired by fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors affixed on the bogies of an in-service high-speed train are offered to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the proposed methodology. Finally, conclusions are drawn in2. Bayesian DLM and forecastingThe Bayesian DLM is a kind of process-based Bayesian prediction model which provides a flexible way to intuitively capture how processes evolve over time. It consists of two basic equations: an observation (measurement) equation and a system (evolution) equation . The observation (measurement) equation describes the relationship between the observed\nrandom vectors with mean zero and unknown covariance matrices V t and W t. The DLM defined above amounts to treating ht\nrange level at time t, and at represents the stress range change between time t 1 and t. v t is the zero-mean Gaussian random variable representing the error of measurement at moment t. x1t and x2t are both zero-mean Gaussian random variables representing the evolution of DLM from time t 1 to t. In association with the form of DLM in Equation (1), we haveThe Bayesian forecasting philosophy is based on the description of an observed process using its probability density function (PDF). As implied by the name, the Bayesian forecasting approach commences from Bayes’ theorem, hence enabling the calculation of conditional probabilities. The details of using DLM for the recursive one-step ahead forecasting of the (posterior) distribution of monitoring-derived stress ranges under the Bayesian framework are presented as follows\nNote that in Step 4, Atþ1 is the adaptive coefficient which can be viewed as the information tuner. It scales the correction term according to the relative variances of the prior and likelihood, as measured by Rtþ1=Q tþ1 and regressor value Ftþ1. etþ1 is\nthe one-step forward forecast error, the difference between the observed value ytþ1 and its expectation f tþ1. More details\nabout the recursive one-step ahead forecast method can be found in .3. Defect detection methodologyThe proposed defect detection methodology contains three logical processes: outlier detection, change-point detection,\nand damage assessment. By comparing the real-time measurement with the predicted values, the named outlier detection and change-point detection are devised to determine whether the measurement is a single outlier or the first observation of a remarkable change, the former being executed by calculating the Bayes factor, while the latter being based on the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once a change-point is affirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for further damagePotential outlier detection is the first step in the process of the proposed defect detection approach, accomplished by the Bayes factor calculation. Bayes factor is advocated because of its straightforward and natural interpretation of evidence afforded by data. At every time step t, the Bayesian DLM can yield a PDF for the next measurement, labeled as M0. Meanwhile, an artificial alternative model labeled as M1 is defined by shifting the mean of M0 by +h. The underlying idea of outlier\ndetection is to check the current observation against both M0 and M1. For each time step t, the Bayes factor is the ratio of thewhere yt is the measurement at time t and Dt1 refers to the history information up to time t 1. In the case of Gaussianwhere h is the shift value; yt is the observation value; f t and rt are the mean and standard deviation of the forecasting distribution for observation at time t. A Bayes factor H ¼ 1 indicates that the probability of the observation derived from model M1 is identical to the probability of that derived from Model M0. For better quantitative comparison between any two models, Jeffreys suggested interpreting the Bayes factor as a scale of evidence and provided descriptive statements although\nthe partitions are somewhat arbitrary. According to his suggestion, a Bayes factor can be divided into several intervals for assessing the significance of discrimination: 1 < H < 3 is ‘barely worth mentioning’, 3 < H < 10 is ‘substantial’,\n10 < H < 30 is ‘strong’, 30 < H < 100 is ‘very strong’, and H > 100 is ‘decisive’. In this study, Hmin ¼ 10 is set as a threshold\nAfter the confirmation of Hmin and h, an uncertainty limit (ucl) can be procured by the following equationFor instance, when the confidence level a and threshold of Bayes factor Hmin are set as 90% and 10 respectively, the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt. Thus, an observation is diagnosed as an outlier if its deviation from the mean value of M0 is larger\nWith the Bayes factor defined in Equation (9), only outliers with a positive deviation can be detected. To enable the outliers with negative deviation to be detected as well, a second Bayes factor is defined asIn the automatic monitoring process, both the Bayes factors H1;t and H2;t should be examined in parallel to enable thebehavior, rather than judgments based on long past performances. Change-point is an abrupt variation in time series data,\nrepresenting a transition that occurs between states. Change-point detection aims to detect abrupt change in the generative\nprocess of sequential data. It is assumed that a sequence of observations y1; ; yT could be divided into several nonoverlapping partitions, e.g. dataset j 1, dataset j, and dataset j + 1 as shown in Fig. 2. The delineations between partitions\nare known as change-points (e.g. TOC j 1 and TOC j); the goal of change-point detection is the determination of where the\nboundary of two adjacent partitions is located in a sequence of observations. Change-point detection approaches can be classified into offline and online methods. The former needs to observe the whole sequential observations before aiming to make\ninference on the generative process of the sequence [37–40], wheras the latter aims to update the inference at each time step\nwith the newly acquired measurements from the sequence [41–43]. In particular, the Bayesian online change-point detection methods are based on computing the probability distribution of the run length.differentiate between the single-point outlier and the beginning of a continual change. To overcome this problem, cumulative Bayes factor (local Bayes factors) is recommended to detect change-point(s) in the sequence of observations, by definingwhere lmax is the maximum number of Bayes factors taken into account. Unlike Bayes factor with implicitly no historical influence in the judgement, the consecutive Bayes factors collect evidence of change over a series of observation (from time\net al. . Akin to the Bayes factor threshold for outlier detection, the threshold of maximal cumulative Bayes factors is set as Lmin ¼ 10. If the conditions Lt > Lmin and lt > lmin occur simultaneously, an alarm of change is immediately issued at time t\n(time of notification, TON). The real time of occurrence (TOC) is (t lt þ 1), that is, TOC =t lt þ 1.Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is performed to assess damage extent and quantify the\nassociated uncertainty. The proposed approach directly quantifies the likelihoods of two scenarios (e.g., the sequential observations before and after the change-point), that is, ‘‘no fault” and ‘‘fault”, and the yielded results are easy to interpret. An\nadditional merit of the proposed approach is its ability to quantify the uncertainty in damage detection. Assume that the observed sequential data can be divided into two non-overlapping partitions, the first of which is regarded as healthy\nof the observations. Thus, the damage detection problem becomes the test of H0 : l ¼ l0 versus H1 : l–l0 with\nWith the above, damage detection can be achieved by means of Bayes factor which is defined as the ratio of the probability of observations given the alternate hypothesis to the probability of observations given the null hypothesiswhere D ¼ yf 1; ; yng refers to the observed data. It is proven to bewhere refers to the mean of the observed data fy1; ; yng. If no prior information is available, the initial mean and variance can be set as q ¼ l0 and s ¼ r 0 [][. The two assumptions take the prior mean and variance in the alternative hypothesis as]where z ¼ pfn **f** i ffi l0 0 [ At each time step (i.e.,][ n][=1), the Bayes factor][ B][ is larger for the larger values of][ z][j j][, which is reasonable]and easy to interpret. The logarithm of the Bayes factor, for convenience of comparison among a larger of values, is derived asIf the Bayes factor B10 is larger than 1, the implication is that the observed data provide evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis H1 (i.e., the structure is damaged). Otherwise, the observed data are judged to support the null hypothesis H0 (i.e.,\nthe structure is healthy). As with the previous threshold, B10 10 is set as a threshold for damage indication.\nIntegrating together the outlier detection, change-point detection and damage assessment, the implementation procedures of the proposed methodology are shown in Fig. 3. Beginning at time t, the single Bayes factor is firstly evaluated to\njudge whether yt is an outlier. If not, the maximum cumulative Bayes factor Lt and run length lt for change-point detection are calculated. Once a change-point is detected, the intervention is carried out by resetting the time to the time of occurrence\n(i.e., TOC = t lt þ 1) and by adjusting the mean value of M0 to the observation yt (i.e., f t ¼ yt), and the subsequent analysis\nwill then be started at TOC. Meanwhile, Bayesian hypothesis testing is executed for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification from the current TOC to the next TOC.4. Application to in-service monitoring data of high-speed trainAn onboard monitoring system has been designed and implemented on an in-service high-speed passenger train running on the Lanzhou-Urumqi High-Speed Railway (LUHSR) in China . As shown in Fig. 4, the monitoring system is composed\nof a total of 52 FBG strain sensors, 4 FBG temperature sensors, 11 accelerometers (tri-axial) and 1 noise sensor deployed on both motor and trailer bogies. Also, one tri-axial FBG accelerometer, one video camera and two GPS sensors are installed inside a train carriage. As the present work is focused on the real-time detection of potentially defective wheels by using strain monitoring data from bogies, only the deployment of strain sensors is concerned. The strain sensors are mounted\non 4 measurement zones of the bogies: (i) the zone with the action of high loads; (ii) the stress transmission zone; (iii)\nthe zone with high responses predicted by finite element analysis; and (iv) welded joints. FBG strain (and temperature) sensors are deployed and attached to the surface of the train bogie with industrial glue and tapes, and connected to the interrogator (data logger) with laptop inside the train carriage through optical fiber cables.\nThe data utilized in this study were obtained from a monitoring schedule spanning 18 days as shown in Table 1. The total length of the LUHSR between Lanzhou and Urumqi is 1777 km. In the trip from Lanzhou to Urumqi, the high-speed train\nstops by 14 stations and travels cross 13 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 13th); in trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou, the high-speed train stops by 15 stations and travels cross 14 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 14th). During the monitoring\nperiod, the train operated at its normal speed around 200–250 km/h. The sampling rate for all the sensors was set at 5000\nSince the train wheels were lathed (lathing is a process to make wheels perfectly rounded) during the monitoring period,\nthe recorded data contain information in line with two different states (before lathing and after lathing). The wheels can be considered as potentially unhealthy (defective) before lathing and as healthy after lathing. To verify the effectiveness of theproposed real-time defect detection methodology, the strain monitoring data obtained from the bogies before and afterThe train’s dynamic responses may be influenced by different subgrade conditions of the railroad, such as ground, tunnel,\nand bridge. To eliminate the effects of different railroad conditions, the strain data recorded from the same railroad sectionbefore and after lathing, are used in each scenario. In addition, the passenger loads in different trips are deemed statistically identical and the speed of train is assumed to be constant as in normal operation. Without loss of generality, the monitoring\ndata respectively obtained from two typical railroad sections (1st and 14th) in the trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou are chosen to illustrate the proposed real-time defect detection methodology, which are from the strain gauge (MS3-7) deployed at the For the sake of brevity, the monitoring data collected from the 1st railroad section are denoted as Case 1, while those from the 14th railroad section are denoted as Case 2. Firstly, the measured strain is converted to stress for the subsequent stress\nrange calculation. For the strain gauges mounted on the steel surface, the conversion of the measured strain to stress is made by rs ¼ Ee, where E is the elasticity modulus of steel and e is the strain after eliminating the effect of varying temperatures.where em is the measured strain, T m is the measured temperature in the vicinity of the strain sensor, T 0 is the temperature at\nthe installation, and a1 is a constant coefficient. In our case, the original temperature is 4, i.e., T 0 ¼ 4. The results of temperature compensation are demonstrated in Fig. 5. It is obvious that the trend in strain responses caused by temperature\nAfterwards, the stress ranges are extracted from the monitoring-derived stress data by the application of the rainflow\ncounting algorithm. From each stress cycle, the stress range Sa is obtained by calculating the difference between the maximum stress rmax and the minimum stress rmin measured in that stress cycle, i.e., Sa ¼ rmax rmin. More details on the stress ranges extraction are given in . The stress ranges with amplitudes lower than 1 MPa need to be culled because the majority are caused by noise. To decrease the uncertainty arising from the measurement facilities, the average stress ranges for\nevery ten minutes are used as the target quantities. Due to the different lengths of the two selected railroad sections (1st and 14th), the traveling time of the train in each section is also different. This results in different data lengths. The data\nlengths of the average stress ranges in Case 1 and Case 2 are 110 and 90, respectively. Figs. and 7 show the original measured strain responses before and after lathing in Case 1 and Case 2, respectively.Following the implementation procedures mentioned before, the defect detection results for Case 1 are demonstrated in\nFigs. and 9. Fig. 8(a) shows the average stress range (red point) together with 1-step ahead prediction (blue solid line) and\nthe corresponding 90% prediction interval (grey shadow). It is observed that, although some observations at the time interval t 2 fall outside the 90% prediction interval, only the Bayes factor at time t ¼ 55 exceeds the established threshold of Hmin ¼ 10 as shown in Fig. 9(a). It is thus judged as an outlier (marked as h). The reason is that because when applying the proposed approach, the shift parameter is set as h ¼ 1:645rt, resulting in the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt while the other\nfour observations are still within the uncertainty limit. On the other hand, Fig. 9(b)–(c) shows the results of the maximum cumulative Bayes factor and the corresponding run length for change detection. It is seen that the maximum cumulative\nBayes factor values at time instants t ¼ 56; 57 and 58 are larger than the threshold of Lmin ¼ 10, while merely the run length at instant t ¼ 58 surpasses the threshold of lmin ¼ 4. Apparently, this observation at time t ¼ 58 fulfills the conditions of change-point detection causing an alarm to be issued (i.e., TON ¼ 58). The identified real occurrence time of change-point is t ¼ 55 (i.e., TOC ¼ 58 4 þ 1 ¼ 55), which coincides well with the actual time point of lathing the wheels. In accordance\nwith the real-time identification of change-point occurrence, the prediction model is refined by altering the guessed mean\nvalue at TOC, as shown in Fig. 8(b). The predictions near TOC in the refined model obviously agree well with the actual observations, thus offering a better prediction performance than that of the original model.\nThe results of defect detection by means of Bayesian hypothesis testing are illustrated in Fig. 9(d). The discrimination between ‘‘healthy” and ‘‘defective” is quantified by the logarithm value of Bayes factor. It is seen from Fig. 9(d) that the vast\nmajority of logarithm values of Bayes factor before TOC are nearly zero and below the threshold level (dotted red line), which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘healthy state” (no defect). This is consistent with the actual health condition and thus validatesthe capability of the Bayesian hypothesis testing. On the contrary, all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than 2, meaning that the corresponding Bayes factor values exceed 100. According to the classification of Bayes factor stipulated in Sub-section 3.1, this result (H > 100) favors the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity is classified as ‘‘decisive”. Indeed, wheels immediately before being sent to depot for lathing were in the state of ‘heavily defective’.\nMaking use of Eq. (21), the probabilities of damage after TOC are obtained as 100%, that is, the wheels are identified as defective with a very high confidence.\nThe defect detection results for Case 2 are similar to Case 1, and are illustrated in Figs. and 11. As seen in Fig. 11(a)–(c)\nno outlier exists throughout the whole period, but a change-point is identified, of which the time of notification is t ¼ 44 (i.e.,\nTON ¼ 44) and the real time of occurrence is t ¼ 41 (i.e., TOC ¼ 44 4 þ 1 ¼ 41). The result matches well with the actual time point when wheel lathing is inflicted. For the predictions near the change-point, the modified prediction model\n(Fig. 10(b)) offers a better performance than the original model (Fig. 10(a)). As illustrated in Fig. 11(d), all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than the threshold (dotted red line), whereas the values before TOC are within thethreshold line. The values of Bayes factor after TOC are obtained to be higher than 100 (H > 100) and the corresponding probabilities of damage are approximately 100%, which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity\nApart from the accuracy of the proposed approach, the computational efficiency is also of concern. The algorithmic implementation is performed on a Lenovo ThinkCentre M720t desktop (Lenovo, Beijing, China) with Dual Intel Core i7-8700 processor (Intel, California, USA) and 24 GB of memory. The computation times consumed in Case 1 and Case 2 are 4.0109 s and\n3.7704 s respectively. In this sense, it realizes the detection of wheel defects in real time.5. ConclusionsA novel methodology for real-time defect detection of high-speed train wheels using Bayesian forecasting and dynamic linear model (DLM) has been developed and validated in this study. First, the DLM is formulated to approximate the actual\nframework. Afterwards, three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) are elicited for outlier detection and change-point detection. After the change-point has been confirmed, damage assessment is executed by the Bayesian hypothesis testing of the sequential observations before and after the change-point. Due to accommodating the dynamic evolution process and the statistical nature of the method, the proposed approach not only possesses the ability of real-time damage detection, but also enables damage quantification (through classifying the range of Bayes factor) and uncertainty assessment (through calculating the probability of damage). The methodology is illustrated by using the onlinelathing). In the two cases addressed, wheel defects are successfully identified, hence validating the effectiveness of the developed method. The quantitative results about the damage extent and confidence would provide useful information helping to\nmake cost-effective, risk-based decisions with the aim of maintaining the operation safety of high-speed rail.\nDespite the proposed methodology being developed for wheel defect detection of high-speed trains, it can also be applied to low-speed passenger and freight trains as well as extended to SHM for a wide variety of civil infrastructure (e.g., bridges,\nbuildings and tunnels) when vibration signals are available via monitoring. In this study, the second-order polynomial DLM\nis employed to model the stress ranges, which only considers the change of stress range level and trend. However, most longterm SHM data, especially long-term strain monitoring data, are generally contaminated by trend, seasonal (cyclical) and\nregression effects, which require a more complex model. The Bayesian DLM enables the modeling of time-dependent responses of a structure by integrating appropriate components, for instance, the response with cyclical characteristics\ncan be depicted by embedding a seasonal (cyclical) component. Thus, in accordance with the nature of monitoring data,\nan appropriate Bayesian DLM enabling to describe time series data of different features, can be formulated for damage detection of a variety of structures subject to different operational/environmental conditions.Administrative Region, China (Project No. PolyU 152024/17E).

IntroductionHigh-speed rail (HSR) is being developed in Asian and European countries to satisfy the rapidly growing demand for intercity services and to shore up economic growth. The rapid\ngrowth of HSR, however, has posed great challenges regarding operation safety, reliability\nand ride comfort. Irregular wheel defects can induce high-magnitude impact forces hindering safety and ride comfort of HSR and may also cause damage to rail tracks and vehicles.real time. The proposed methodology embraces logics for (i) prognosis, (ii) potential outlier\ndetection, (iii) identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and (iv) quantification of damage extent and uncertainty. Relying on the strain monitoring data acquired from high-speed train bogies, the Bayesian DLM for characterizing the actual stress ranges is established, by which one-step forecast distribution is elicited before proceeding to the\nnext observation. The detection of change-point is executed by comparing the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM) and an alternative model\n(the mean value is shifted by a prescribed offset) to determine which better fits the actual observation. If the comparison results are in favor of the alternative model, it is claimed that a potential change has occurred. Whether such an observation is an outlier or the beginning of a genuine change (change-point), three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum\ncumulative Bayes factor and run length) are performed for further identification.

Rail accidents were occasionally caused by failures such as severe defects or fatigue of railway components. To maintain a good service quality and operation safety, it is paramount to develop\nonline monitoring techniques that not only quickly recognize faults of mission-critical HSR components but also can anticipate of long-term mechanisms and gradual deterioration in performance.\nWheelsets in a high-speed train are physically connected with and controlled by the bogie system which corrects alignment for stable running and reduces the vibration caused by wheel-rail interaction . However, the wheel performance\nprogressively deteriorates in different mechanisms (e.g., wheel flat and wheel polygonization) during the routine operation of a high-speed train . Wheel performance deterioration increases stresses experienced by the bogie system. In addition,\nthe increased stress within bogie frames caused by wheel quality deterioration can be unexpectedly large, thus posing a serious threat to the operation safety of concerned trains. According to the statistics of train accidents caused by failure in\nmechanical components during 2004 to 2007 in the United States, the wheelsets faults are the most cause with a rate of\n44.7% . Therefore, the railway managers are keen to keep wheels in an adequate condition and detect potential failure\nas soon as possible. For railway wheels, there are three different ways of estimating the conditions: physical modeling, statistical modeling and condition monitoring . However, the first two ways are not applicable to in-service\nwheel condition assessment, and in contrast, the third way is most feasible for wheel condition estimation. The monitoring approaches available to wheel defect detection can be divided into in-workshop inspection and in-service detection . The\nlatter provides the real-time data required for maintenance planning, while the former is normally carried out at workshops at fixed intervals. The commonly used in-workshop methods for wheel defect inspection include the ultrasonic techniques, infrared camera and magnetic methods . In-service monitoring approaches can be categorized as on-board and wayside methods. The on-board methods implement sensors on the train and continuously obtain comprehensive data from\nthe system. The methods of this category include magnetic technique , ultrasonic technique , acoustic technique, and vibration technique . On the other hand, wayside methods attempt to detect the wheel or vehicle performance\nby installing sensors on the rail or its surrounding areas. Such indirect measurements give rise to limited information of the wheel condition while they can monitor all train wheels going by with using only one or a few sensors. According to the type\nof sensors used, wayside detection approaches include strain sensing technology , fiber optic sensing technology ,\nultrasonic technique , vibration technique , acoustic emission , lasers and high-speed cameras . However,\nthe study on data interpretation techniques enabling the extraction of defect-sensitive features is far from sufficient.\nBayesian dynamic linear model (DLM) is an elegant system approach to handling time series data from a Bayesian perspective, which originates from the field of applied statistics and is extensively used in other fields such as economics\nand engineering [25–30]. The Bayesian DLM treats the time series as the output of a dynamic system perturbed by random disturbances. It is suitable for modeling both univariate and multivariate time series, and also for representing the structural changes, non-stationarity and irregular patterns . Unlike the classical time series method which assumes a fixed relationship between the dependent variables (response variables) and the independent variables (regressors), the DLM considers\nthe relationship changes over time and is able to directly capture time series data features, such as trend, seasonality,\nand regression effects. Moreover, the DLM allows for descriptions of temporary or permanent shifts in time series parameters that occur abruptly, which are necessary for outlier and damage detection in structural health monitoring (SHM) paradigms. Recently, Goulet and his collaborator adopted the Bayesian DLM theory in SHM to model the time-dependent\nresponses of structures by breaking them into subcomponents. In the perspective of real-time damage detection, only few studies are available. The first attempt was conducted by Lipowsky et al. with the development of a Bayesian DLM-based\nreal-time detection algorithm to evaluate the performance of a gas turbine using simulated data. Later on, Wang et al.\nand Zhang et al. adopted the above algorithm for detecting high-speed train defects by using real-world monitoring\ndata. In the previous studies, however, the real-time detection algorithm devised possesses only outlier identification and\nchange detection abilities, without the function of damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.context of Bayesian DLM, which incorporates logics for prognosis, potential outlier detection, identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and damage extent and uncertainty quantification. The Bayesian DLM is considered as a tool\nfor time series analysis, while Bayesian forecasting is executed to enable the calculation of one-step ahead forecast distribution. The change-point detection is performed by checking the current observation against the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM for current instant) as well as against an alternative model of which the mean value\nis shifted by a prescribed offset. The detection rule is that if the alternative model better fits the actual observation, a potential change is signaled. To further determine whether such an observation is only an outlier or the beginning of an actual\nchange (change-point), a specific logic is developed by introducing the Bayes factor and the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.\nThe main contributions of this study are the provision of: (i) a formula which not only enables the modeling of actual framework; (ii) three metrics (i.e., the Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) to allow for outlier\nand change-point detection in real-time manner; and (iii) an efficient way for damage extent assessment and uncertainty\nquantification. The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the Bayesian DLM theory and an elaboration of the Bayesian forecasting philosophy. Section 3 presents the defect detection methodology that incorporates logics for\noutlier detection, change-point identification, and damage assessment. In Section 4, two case studies making use of timeseries strain data acquired by fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors affixed on the bogies of an in-service high-speed train are offered to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the proposed methodology. Finally, conclusions are drawn in2. Bayesian DLM and forecastingThe Bayesian DLM is a kind of process-based Bayesian prediction model which provides a flexible way to intuitively capture how processes evolve over time. It consists of two basic equations: an observation (measurement) equation and a system (evolution) equation . The observation (measurement) equation describes the relationship between the observed\nrandom vectors with mean zero and unknown covariance matrices V t and W t. The DLM defined above amounts to treating ht\nrange level at time t, and at represents the stress range change between time t 1 and t. v t is the zero-mean Gaussian random variable representing the error of measurement at moment t. x1t and x2t are both zero-mean Gaussian random variables representing the evolution of DLM from time t 1 to t. In association with the form of DLM in Equation (1), we haveThe Bayesian forecasting philosophy is based on the description of an observed process using its probability density function (PDF). As implied by the name, the Bayesian forecasting approach commences from Bayes’ theorem, hence enabling the calculation of conditional probabilities. The details of using DLM for the recursive one-step ahead forecasting of the (posterior) distribution of monitoring-derived stress ranges under the Bayesian framework are presented as follows\nNote that in Step 4, Atþ1 is the adaptive coefficient which can be viewed as the information tuner. It scales the correction term according to the relative variances of the prior and likelihood, as measured by Rtþ1=Q tþ1 and regressor value Ftþ1. etþ1 is\nthe one-step forward forecast error, the difference between the observed value ytþ1 and its expectation f tþ1. More details\nabout the recursive one-step ahead forecast method can be found in .3. Defect detection methodologyThe proposed defect detection methodology contains three logical processes: outlier detection, change-point detection,\nand damage assessment. By comparing the real-time measurement with the predicted values, the named outlier detection and change-point detection are devised to determine whether the measurement is a single outlier or the first observation of a remarkable change, the former being executed by calculating the Bayes factor, while the latter being based on the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once a change-point is affirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for further damagePotential outlier detection is the first step in the process of the proposed defect detection approach, accomplished by the Bayes factor calculation. Bayes factor is advocated because of its straightforward and natural interpretation of evidence afforded by data. At every time step t, the Bayesian DLM can yield a PDF for the next measurement, labeled as M0. Meanwhile, an artificial alternative model labeled as M1 is defined by shifting the mean of M0 by +h. The underlying idea of outlier\ndetection is to check the current observation against both M0 and M1. For each time step t, the Bayes factor is the ratio of thewhere yt is the measurement at time t and Dt1 refers to the history information up to time t 1. In the case of Gaussianwhere h is the shift value; yt is the observation value; f t and rt are the mean and standard deviation of the forecasting distribution for observation at time t. A Bayes factor H ¼ 1 indicates that the probability of the observation derived from model M1 is identical to the probability of that derived from Model M0. For better quantitative comparison between any two models, Jeffreys suggested interpreting the Bayes factor as a scale of evidence and provided descriptive statements although\nthe partitions are somewhat arbitrary. According to his suggestion, a Bayes factor can be divided into several intervals for assessing the significance of discrimination: 1 < H < 3 is ‘barely worth mentioning’, 3 < H < 10 is ‘substantial’,\n10 < H < 30 is ‘strong’, 30 < H < 100 is ‘very strong’, and H > 100 is ‘decisive’. In this study, Hmin ¼ 10 is set as a threshold\nAfter the confirmation of Hmin and h, an uncertainty limit (ucl) can be procured by the following equationFor instance, when the confidence level a and threshold of Bayes factor Hmin are set as 90% and 10 respectively, the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt. Thus, an observation is diagnosed as an outlier if its deviation from the mean value of M0 is larger\nWith the Bayes factor defined in Equation (9), only outliers with a positive deviation can be detected. To enable the outliers with negative deviation to be detected as well, a second Bayes factor is defined asIn the automatic monitoring process, both the Bayes factors H1;t and H2;t should be examined in parallel to enable thebehavior, rather than judgments based on long past performances. Change-point is an abrupt variation in time series data,\nrepresenting a transition that occurs between states. Change-point detection aims to detect abrupt change in the generative\nprocess of sequential data. It is assumed that a sequence of observations y1; ; yT could be divided into several nonoverlapping partitions, e.g. dataset j 1, dataset j, and dataset j + 1 as shown in Fig. 2. The delineations between partitions\nare known as change-points (e.g. TOC j 1 and TOC j); the goal of change-point detection is the determination of where the\nboundary of two adjacent partitions is located in a sequence of observations. Change-point detection approaches can be classified into offline and online methods. The former needs to observe the whole sequential observations before aiming to make\ninference on the generative process of the sequence [37–40], wheras the latter aims to update the inference at each time step\nwith the newly acquired measurements from the sequence [41–43]. In particular, the Bayesian online change-point detection methods are based on computing the probability distribution of the run length.differentiate between the single-point outlier and the beginning of a continual change. To overcome this problem, cumulative Bayes factor (local Bayes factors) is recommended to detect change-point(s) in the sequence of observations, by definingwhere lmax is the maximum number of Bayes factors taken into account. Unlike Bayes factor with implicitly no historical influence in the judgement, the consecutive Bayes factors collect evidence of change over a series of observation (from time\net al. . Akin to the Bayes factor threshold for outlier detection, the threshold of maximal cumulative Bayes factors is set as Lmin ¼ 10. If the conditions Lt > Lmin and lt > lmin occur simultaneously, an alarm of change is immediately issued at time t\n(time of notification, TON). The real time of occurrence (TOC) is (t lt þ 1), that is, TOC =t lt þ 1.Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is performed to assess damage extent and quantify the\nassociated uncertainty. The proposed approach directly quantifies the likelihoods of two scenarios (e.g., the sequential observations before and after the change-point), that is, ‘‘no fault” and ‘‘fault”, and the yielded results are easy to interpret. An\nadditional merit of the proposed approach is its ability to quantify the uncertainty in damage detection. Assume that the observed sequential data can be divided into two non-overlapping partitions, the first of which is regarded as healthy\nof the observations. Thus, the damage detection problem becomes the test of H0 : l ¼ l0 versus H1 : l–l0 with\nWith the above, damage detection can be achieved by means of Bayes factor which is defined as the ratio of the probability of observations given the alternate hypothesis to the probability of observations given the null hypothesiswhere D ¼ yf 1; ; yng refers to the observed data. It is proven to bewhere refers to the mean of the observed data fy1; ; yng. If no prior information is available, the initial mean and variance can be set as q ¼ l0 and s ¼ r 0 [][. The two assumptions take the prior mean and variance in the alternative hypothesis as]where z ¼ pfn **f** i ffi l0 0 [ At each time step (i.e.,][ n][=1), the Bayes factor][ B][ is larger for the larger values of][ z][j j][, which is reasonable]and easy to interpret. The logarithm of the Bayes factor, for convenience of comparison among a larger of values, is derived asIf the Bayes factor B10 is larger than 1, the implication is that the observed data provide evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis H1 (i.e., the structure is damaged). Otherwise, the observed data are judged to support the null hypothesis H0 (i.e.,\nthe structure is healthy). As with the previous threshold, B10 10 is set as a threshold for damage indication.\nIntegrating together the outlier detection, change-point detection and damage assessment, the implementation procedures of the proposed methodology are shown in Fig. 3. Beginning at time t, the single Bayes factor is firstly evaluated to\njudge whether yt is an outlier. If not, the maximum cumulative Bayes factor Lt and run length lt for change-point detection are calculated. Once a change-point is detected, the intervention is carried out by resetting the time to the time of occurrence\n(i.e., TOC = t lt þ 1) and by adjusting the mean value of M0 to the observation yt (i.e., f t ¼ yt), and the subsequent analysis\nwill then be started at TOC. Meanwhile, Bayesian hypothesis testing is executed for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification from the current TOC to the next TOC.4. Application to in-service monitoring data of high-speed trainAn onboard monitoring system has been designed and implemented on an in-service high-speed passenger train running on the Lanzhou-Urumqi High-Speed Railway (LUHSR) in China . As shown in Fig. 4, the monitoring system is composed\nof a total of 52 FBG strain sensors, 4 FBG temperature sensors, 11 accelerometers (tri-axial) and 1 noise sensor deployed on both motor and trailer bogies. Also, one tri-axial FBG accelerometer, one video camera and two GPS sensors are installed inside a train carriage. As the present work is focused on the real-time detection of potentially defective wheels by using strain monitoring data from bogies, only the deployment of strain sensors is concerned. The strain sensors are mounted\non 4 measurement zones of the bogies: (i) the zone with the action of high loads; (ii) the stress transmission zone; (iii)\nthe zone with high responses predicted by finite element analysis; and (iv) welded joints. FBG strain (and temperature) sensors are deployed and attached to the surface of the train bogie with industrial glue and tapes, and connected to the interrogator (data logger) with laptop inside the train carriage through optical fiber cables.\nThe data utilized in this study were obtained from a monitoring schedule spanning 18 days as shown in Table 1. The total length of the LUHSR between Lanzhou and Urumqi is 1777 km. In the trip from Lanzhou to Urumqi, the high-speed train\nstops by 14 stations and travels cross 13 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 13th); in trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou, the high-speed train stops by 15 stations and travels cross 14 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 14th). During the monitoring\nperiod, the train operated at its normal speed around 200–250 km/h. The sampling rate for all the sensors was set at 5000\nSince the train wheels were lathed (lathing is a process to make wheels perfectly rounded) during the monitoring period,\nthe recorded data contain information in line with two different states (before lathing and after lathing). The wheels can be considered as potentially unhealthy (defective) before lathing and as healthy after lathing. To verify the effectiveness of theproposed real-time defect detection methodology, the strain monitoring data obtained from the bogies before and afterThe train’s dynamic responses may be influenced by different subgrade conditions of the railroad, such as ground, tunnel,\nand bridge. To eliminate the effects of different railroad conditions, the strain data recorded from the same railroad sectionbefore and after lathing, are used in each scenario. In addition, the passenger loads in different trips are deemed statistically identical and the speed of train is assumed to be constant as in normal operation. Without loss of generality, the monitoring\ndata respectively obtained from two typical railroad sections (1st and 14th) in the trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou are chosen to illustrate the proposed real-time defect detection methodology, which are from the strain gauge (MS3-7) deployed at the For the sake of brevity, the monitoring data collected from the 1st railroad section are denoted as Case 1, while those from the 14th railroad section are denoted as Case 2. Firstly, the measured strain is converted to stress for the subsequent stress\nrange calculation. For the strain gauges mounted on the steel surface, the conversion of the measured strain to stress is made by rs ¼ Ee, where E is the elasticity modulus of steel and e is the strain after eliminating the effect of varying temperatures.where em is the measured strain, T m is the measured temperature in the vicinity of the strain sensor, T 0 is the temperature at\nthe installation, and a1 is a constant coefficient. In our case, the original temperature is 4, i.e., T 0 ¼ 4. The results of temperature compensation are demonstrated in Fig. 5. It is obvious that the trend in strain responses caused by temperature\nAfterwards, the stress ranges are extracted from the monitoring-derived stress data by the application of the rainflow\ncounting algorithm. From each stress cycle, the stress range Sa is obtained by calculating the difference between the maximum stress rmax and the minimum stress rmin measured in that stress cycle, i.e., Sa ¼ rmax rmin. More details on the stress ranges extraction are given in . The stress ranges with amplitudes lower than 1 MPa need to be culled because the majority are caused by noise. To decrease the uncertainty arising from the measurement facilities, the average stress ranges for\nevery ten minutes are used as the target quantities. Due to the different lengths of the two selected railroad sections (1st and 14th), the traveling time of the train in each section is also different. This results in different data lengths. The data\nlengths of the average stress ranges in Case 1 and Case 2 are 110 and 90, respectively. Figs. and 7 show the original measured strain responses before and after lathing in Case 1 and Case 2, respectively.Following the implementation procedures mentioned before, the defect detection results for Case 1 are demonstrated in\nFigs. and 9. Fig. 8(a) shows the average stress range (red point) together with 1-step ahead prediction (blue solid line) and\nthe corresponding 90% prediction interval (grey shadow). It is observed that, although some observations at the time interval t 2 fall outside the 90% prediction interval, only the Bayes factor at time t ¼ 55 exceeds the established threshold of Hmin ¼ 10 as shown in Fig. 9(a). It is thus judged as an outlier (marked as h). The reason is that because when applying the proposed approach, the shift parameter is set as h ¼ 1:645rt, resulting in the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt while the other\nfour observations are still within the uncertainty limit. On the other hand, Fig. 9(b)–(c) shows the results of the maximum cumulative Bayes factor and the corresponding run length for change detection. It is seen that the maximum cumulative\nBayes factor values at time instants t ¼ 56; 57 and 58 are larger than the threshold of Lmin ¼ 10, while merely the run length at instant t ¼ 58 surpasses the threshold of lmin ¼ 4. Apparently, this observation at time t ¼ 58 fulfills the conditions of change-point detection causing an alarm to be issued (i.e., TON ¼ 58). The identified real occurrence time of change-point is t ¼ 55 (i.e., TOC ¼ 58 4 þ 1 ¼ 55), which coincides well with the actual time point of lathing the wheels. In accordance\nwith the real-time identification of change-point occurrence, the prediction model is refined by altering the guessed mean\nvalue at TOC, as shown in Fig. 8(b). The predictions near TOC in the refined model obviously agree well with the actual observations, thus offering a better prediction performance than that of the original model.\nThe results of defect detection by means of Bayesian hypothesis testing are illustrated in Fig. 9(d). The discrimination between ‘‘healthy” and ‘‘defective” is quantified by the logarithm value of Bayes factor. It is seen from Fig. 9(d) that the vast\nmajority of logarithm values of Bayes factor before TOC are nearly zero and below the threshold level (dotted red line), which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘healthy state” (no defect). This is consistent with the actual health condition and thus validatesthe capability of the Bayesian hypothesis testing. On the contrary, all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than 2, meaning that the corresponding Bayes factor values exceed 100. According to the classification of Bayes factor stipulated in Sub-section 3.1, this result (H > 100) favors the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity is classified as ‘‘decisive”. Indeed, wheels immediately before being sent to depot for lathing were in the state of ‘heavily defective’.\nMaking use of Eq. (21), the probabilities of damage after TOC are obtained as 100%, that is, the wheels are identified as defective with a very high confidence.\nThe defect detection results for Case 2 are similar to Case 1, and are illustrated in Figs. and 11. As seen in Fig. 11(a)–(c)\nno outlier exists throughout the whole period, but a change-point is identified, of which the time of notification is t ¼ 44 (i.e.,\nTON ¼ 44) and the real time of occurrence is t ¼ 41 (i.e., TOC ¼ 44 4 þ 1 ¼ 41). The result matches well with the actual time point when wheel lathing is inflicted. For the predictions near the change-point, the modified prediction model\n(Fig. 10(b)) offers a better performance than the original model (Fig. 10(a)). As illustrated in Fig. 11(d), all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than the threshold (dotted red line), whereas the values before TOC are within thethreshold line. The values of Bayes factor after TOC are obtained to be higher than 100 (H > 100) and the corresponding probabilities of damage are approximately 100%, which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity\nApart from the accuracy of the proposed approach, the computational efficiency is also of concern. The algorithmic implementation is performed on a Lenovo ThinkCentre M720t desktop (Lenovo, Beijing, China) with Dual Intel Core i7-8700 processor (Intel, California, USA) and 24 GB of memory. The computation times consumed in Case 1 and Case 2 are 4.0109 s and\n3.7704 s respectively. In this sense, it realizes the detection of wheel defects in real time.5. ConclusionsA novel methodology for real-time defect detection of high-speed train wheels using Bayesian forecasting and dynamic linear model (DLM) has been developed and validated in this study. First, the DLM is formulated to approximate the actual\nframework. Afterwards, three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) are elicited for outlier detection and change-point detection. After the change-point has been confirmed, damage assessment is executed by the Bayesian hypothesis testing of the sequential observations before and after the change-point. Due to accommodating the dynamic evolution process and the statistical nature of the method, the proposed approach not only possesses the ability of real-time damage detection, but also enables damage quantification (through classifying the range of Bayes factor) and uncertainty assessment (through calculating the probability of damage). The methodology is illustrated by using the onlinelathing). In the two cases addressed, wheel defects are successfully identified, hence validating the effectiveness of the developed method. The quantitative results about the damage extent and confidence would provide useful information helping to\nmake cost-effective, risk-based decisions with the aim of maintaining the operation safety of high-speed rail.\nDespite the proposed methodology being developed for wheel defect detection of high-speed trains, it can also be applied to low-speed passenger and freight trains as well as extended to SHM for a wide variety of civil infrastructure (e.g., bridges,\nbuildings and tunnels) when vibration signals are available via monitoring. In this study, the second-order polynomial DLM\nis employed to model the stress ranges, which only considers the change of stress range level and trend. However, most longterm SHM data, especially long-term strain monitoring data, are generally contaminated by trend, seasonal (cyclical) and\nregression effects, which require a more complex model. The Bayesian DLM enables the modeling of time-dependent responses of a structure by integrating appropriate components, for instance, the response with cyclical characteristics\ncan be depicted by embedding a seasonal (cyclical) component. Thus, in accordance with the nature of monitoring data,\nan appropriate Bayesian DLM enabling to describe time series data of different features, can be formulated for damage detection of a variety of structures subject to different operational/environmental conditions.Administrative Region, China (Project No. PolyU 152024/17E).

IntroductionHigh-speed rail (HSR) is being developed in Asian and European countries to satisfy the rapidly growing demand for intercity services and to shore up economic growth. The rapid\ngrowth of HSR, however, has posed great challenges regarding operation safety, reliability\nand ride comfort. Irregular wheel defects can induce high-magnitude impact forces hindering safety and ride comfort of HSR and may also cause damage to rail tracks and vehicles.real time. The proposed methodology embraces logics for (i) prognosis, (ii) potential outlier\ndetection, (iii) identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and (iv) quantification of damage extent and uncertainty. Relying on the strain monitoring data acquired from high-speed train bogies, the Bayesian DLM for characterizing the actual stress ranges is established, by which one-step forecast distribution is elicited before proceeding to the\nnext observation. The detection of change-point is executed by comparing the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM) and an alternative model\n(the mean value is shifted by a prescribed offset) to determine which better fits the actual observation. If the comparison results are in favor of the alternative model, it is claimed that a potential change has occurred. Whether such an observation is an outlier or the beginning of a genuine change (change-point), three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum\ncumulative Bayes factor and run length) are performed for further identification. Once a change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for the purpose of\ndamage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification. A severe change, if identified,\ndefects.

Rail accidents were occasionally caused by failures such as severe defects or fatigue of railway components. To maintain a good service quality and operation safety, it is paramount to develop\nonline monitoring techniques that not only quickly recognize faults of mission-critical HSR components but also can anticipate of long-term mechanisms and gradual deterioration in performance.\nWheelsets in a high-speed train are physically connected with and controlled by the bogie system which corrects alignment for stable running and reduces the vibration caused by wheel-rail interaction . However, the wheel performance\nprogressively deteriorates in different mechanisms (e.g., wheel flat and wheel polygonization) during the routine operation of a high-speed train . Wheel performance deterioration increases stresses experienced by the bogie system. In addition,\nthe increased stress within bogie frames caused by wheel quality deterioration can be unexpectedly large, thus posing a serious threat to the operation safety of concerned trains. According to the statistics of train accidents caused by failure in\nmechanical components during 2004 to 2007 in the United States, the wheelsets faults are the most cause with a rate of\n44.7% . Therefore, the railway managers are keen to keep wheels in an adequate condition and detect potential failure\nas soon as possible. For railway wheels, there are three different ways of estimating the conditions: physical modeling, statistical modeling and condition monitoring . However, the first two ways are not applicable to in-service\nwheel condition assessment, and in contrast, the third way is most feasible for wheel condition estimation. The monitoring approaches available to wheel defect detection can be divided into in-workshop inspection and in-service detection . The\nlatter provides the real-time data required for maintenance planning, while the former is normally carried out at workshops at fixed intervals. The commonly used in-workshop methods for wheel defect inspection include the ultrasonic techniques, infrared camera and magnetic methods . In-service monitoring approaches can be categorized as on-board and wayside methods. The on-board methods implement sensors on the train and continuously obtain comprehensive data from\nthe system. The methods of this category include magnetic technique , ultrasonic technique , acoustic technique, and vibration technique . On the other hand, wayside methods attempt to detect the wheel or vehicle performance\nby installing sensors on the rail or its surrounding areas. Such indirect measurements give rise to limited information of the wheel condition while they can monitor all train wheels going by with using only one or a few sensors. According to the type\nof sensors used, wayside detection approaches include strain sensing technology , fiber optic sensing technology ,\nultrasonic technique , vibration technique , acoustic emission , lasers and high-speed cameras . However,\nthe study on data interpretation techniques enabling the extraction of defect-sensitive features is far from sufficient.\nBayesian dynamic linear model (DLM) is an elegant system approach to handling time series data from a Bayesian perspective, which originates from the field of applied statistics and is extensively used in other fields such as economics\nand engineering [25–30]. The Bayesian DLM treats the time series as the output of a dynamic system perturbed by random disturbances. It is suitable for modeling both univariate and multivariate time series, and also for representing the structural changes, non-stationarity and irregular patterns . Unlike the classical time series method which assumes a fixed relationship between the dependent variables (response variables) and the independent variables (regressors), the DLM considers\nthe relationship changes over time and is able to directly capture time series data features, such as trend, seasonality,\nand regression effects. Moreover, the DLM allows for descriptions of temporary or permanent shifts in time series parameters that occur abruptly, which are necessary for outlier and damage detection in structural health monitoring (SHM) paradigms. Recently, Goulet and his collaborator adopted the Bayesian DLM theory in SHM to model the time-dependent\nresponses of structures by breaking them into subcomponents. In the perspective of real-time damage detection, only few studies are available. The first attempt was conducted by Lipowsky et al. with the development of a Bayesian DLM-based\nreal-time detection algorithm to evaluate the performance of a gas turbine using simulated data. Later on, Wang et al.\nand Zhang et al. adopted the above algorithm for detecting high-speed train defects by using real-world monitoring\ndata. In the previous studies, however, the real-time detection algorithm devised possesses only outlier identification and\nchange detection abilities, without the function of damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.context of Bayesian DLM, which incorporates logics for prognosis, potential outlier detection, identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and damage extent and uncertainty quantification. The Bayesian DLM is considered as a tool\nfor time series analysis, while Bayesian forecasting is executed to enable the calculation of one-step ahead forecast distribution. The change-point detection is performed by checking the current observation against the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM for current instant) as well as against an alternative model of which the mean value\nis shifted by a prescribed offset. The detection rule is that if the alternative model better fits the actual observation, a potential change is signaled. To further determine whether such an observation is only an outlier or the beginning of an actual\nchange (change-point), a specific logic is developed by introducing the Bayes factor and the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.\nThe main contributions of this study are the provision of: (i) a formula which not only enables the modeling of actual framework; (ii) three metrics (i.e., the Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) to allow for outlier\nand change-point detection in real-time manner; and (iii) an efficient way for damage extent assessment and uncertainty\nquantification. The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the Bayesian DLM theory and an elaboration of the Bayesian forecasting philosophy. Section 3 presents the defect detection methodology that incorporates logics for\noutlier detection, change-point identification, and damage assessment. In Section 4, two case studies making use of timeseries strain data acquired by fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors affixed on the bogies of an in-service high-speed train are offered to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the proposed methodology. Finally, conclusions are drawn in2. Bayesian DLM and forecastingThe Bayesian DLM is a kind of process-based Bayesian prediction model which provides a flexible way to intuitively capture how processes evolve over time. It consists of two basic equations: an observation (measurement) equation and a system (evolution) equation . The observation (measurement) equation describes the relationship between the observed\nrandom vectors with mean zero and unknown covariance matrices V t and W t. The DLM defined above amounts to treating ht\nrange level at time t, and at represents the stress range change between time t 1 and t. v t is the zero-mean Gaussian random variable representing the error of measurement at moment t. x1t and x2t are both zero-mean Gaussian random variables representing the evolution of DLM from time t 1 to t. In association with the form of DLM in Equation (1), we haveThe Bayesian forecasting philosophy is based on the description of an observed process using its probability density function (PDF). As implied by the name, the Bayesian forecasting approach commences from Bayes’ theorem, hence enabling the calculation of conditional probabilities. The details of using DLM for the recursive one-step ahead forecasting of the (posterior) distribution of monitoring-derived stress ranges under the Bayesian framework are presented as follows\nNote that in Step 4, Atþ1 is the adaptive coefficient which can be viewed as the information tuner. It scales the correction term according to the relative variances of the prior and likelihood, as measured by Rtþ1=Q tþ1 and regressor value Ftþ1. etþ1 is\nthe one-step forward forecast error, the difference between the observed value ytþ1 and its expectation f tþ1. More details\nabout the recursive one-step ahead forecast method can be found in .3. Defect detection methodologyThe proposed defect detection methodology contains three logical processes: outlier detection, change-point detection,\nand damage assessment. By comparing the real-time measurement with the predicted values, the named outlier detection and change-point detection are devised to determine whether the measurement is a single outlier or the first observation of a remarkable change, the former being executed by calculating the Bayes factor, while the latter being based on the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once a change-point is affirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for further damagePotential outlier detection is the first step in the process of the proposed defect detection approach, accomplished by the Bayes factor calculation. Bayes factor is advocated because of its straightforward and natural interpretation of evidence afforded by data. At every time step t, the Bayesian DLM can yield a PDF for the next measurement, labeled as M0. Meanwhile, an artificial alternative model labeled as M1 is defined by shifting the mean of M0 by +h. The underlying idea of outlier\ndetection is to check the current observation against both M0 and M1. For each time step t, the Bayes factor is the ratio of thewhere yt is the measurement at time t and Dt1 refers to the history information up to time t 1. In the case of Gaussianwhere h is the shift value; yt is the observation value; f t and rt are the mean and standard deviation of the forecasting distribution for observation at time t. A Bayes factor H ¼ 1 indicates that the probability of the observation derived from model M1 is identical to the probability of that derived from Model M0. For better quantitative comparison between any two models, Jeffreys suggested interpreting the Bayes factor as a scale of evidence and provided descriptive statements although\nthe partitions are somewhat arbitrary. According to his suggestion, a Bayes factor can be divided into several intervals for assessing the significance of discrimination: 1 < H < 3 is ‘barely worth mentioning’, 3 < H < 10 is ‘substantial’,\n10 < H < 30 is ‘strong’, 30 < H < 100 is ‘very strong’, and H > 100 is ‘decisive’. In this study, Hmin ¼ 10 is set as a threshold\nAfter the confirmation of Hmin and h, an uncertainty limit (ucl) can be procured by the following equationFor instance, when the confidence level a and threshold of Bayes factor Hmin are set as 90% and 10 respectively, the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt. Thus, an observation is diagnosed as an outlier if its deviation from the mean value of M0 is larger\nWith the Bayes factor defined in Equation (9), only outliers with a positive deviation can be detected. To enable the outliers with negative deviation to be detected as well, a second Bayes factor is defined asIn the automatic monitoring process, both the Bayes factors H1;t and H2;t should be examined in parallel to enable thebehavior, rather than judgments based on long past performances. Change-point is an abrupt variation in time series data,\nrepresenting a transition that occurs between states. Change-point detection aims to detect abrupt change in the generative\nprocess of sequential data. It is assumed that a sequence of observations y1; ; yT could be divided into several nonoverlapping partitions, e.g. dataset j 1, dataset j, and dataset j + 1 as shown in Fig. 2. The delineations between partitions\nare known as change-points (e.g. TOC j 1 and TOC j); the goal of change-point detection is the determination of where the\nboundary of two adjacent partitions is located in a sequence of observations. Change-point detection approaches can be classified into offline and online methods. The former needs to observe the whole sequential observations before aiming to make\ninference on the generative process of the sequence [37–40], wheras the latter aims to update the inference at each time step\nwith the newly acquired measurements from the sequence [41–43]. In particular, the Bayesian online change-point detection methods are based on computing the probability distribution of the run length.differentiate between the single-point outlier and the beginning of a continual change. To overcome this problem, cumulative Bayes factor (local Bayes factors) is recommended to detect change-point(s) in the sequence of observations, by definingwhere lmax is the maximum number of Bayes factors taken into account. Unlike Bayes factor with implicitly no historical influence in the judgement, the consecutive Bayes factors collect evidence of change over a series of observation (from time\net al. . Akin to the Bayes factor threshold for outlier detection, the threshold of maximal cumulative Bayes factors is set as Lmin ¼ 10. If the conditions Lt > Lmin and lt > lmin occur simultaneously, an alarm of change is immediately issued at time t\n(time of notification, TON). The real time of occurrence (TOC) is (t lt þ 1), that is, TOC =t lt þ 1.Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is performed to assess damage extent and quantify the\nassociated uncertainty. The proposed approach directly quantifies the likelihoods of two scenarios (e.g., the sequential observations before and after the change-point), that is, ‘‘no fault” and ‘‘fault”, and the yielded results are easy to interpret. An\nadditional merit of the proposed approach is its ability to quantify the uncertainty in damage detection. Assume that the observed sequential data can be divided into two non-overlapping partitions, the first of which is regarded as healthy\nof the observations. Thus, the damage detection problem becomes the test of H0 : l ¼ l0 versus H1 : l–l0 with\nWith the above, damage detection can be achieved by means of Bayes factor which is defined as the ratio of the probability of observations given the alternate hypothesis to the probability of observations given the null hypothesiswhere D ¼ yf 1; ; yng refers to the observed data. It is proven to bewhere refers to the mean of the observed data fy1; ; yng. If no prior information is available, the initial mean and variance can be set as q ¼ l0 and s ¼ r 0 [][. The two assumptions take the prior mean and variance in the alternative hypothesis as]where z ¼ pfn **f** i ffi l0 0 [ At each time step (i.e.,][ n][=1), the Bayes factor][ B][ is larger for the larger values of][ z][j j][, which is reasonable]and easy to interpret. The logarithm of the Bayes factor, for convenience of comparison among a larger of values, is derived asIf the Bayes factor B10 is larger than 1, the implication is that the observed data provide evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis H1 (i.e., the structure is damaged). Otherwise, the observed data are judged to support the null hypothesis H0 (i.e.,\nthe structure is healthy). As with the previous threshold, B10 10 is set as a threshold for damage indication.\nIntegrating together the outlier detection, change-point detection and damage assessment, the implementation procedures of the proposed methodology are shown in Fig. 3. Beginning at time t, the single Bayes factor is firstly evaluated to\njudge whether yt is an outlier. If not, the maximum cumulative Bayes factor Lt and run length lt for change-point detection are calculated. Once a change-point is detected, the intervention is carried out by resetting the time to the time of occurrence\n(i.e., TOC = t lt þ 1) and by adjusting the mean value of M0 to the observation yt (i.e., f t ¼ yt), and the subsequent analysis\nwill then be started at TOC. Meanwhile, Bayesian hypothesis testing is executed for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification from the current TOC to the next TOC.4. Application to in-service monitoring data of high-speed trainAn onboard monitoring system has been designed and implemented on an in-service high-speed passenger train running on the Lanzhou-Urumqi High-Speed Railway (LUHSR) in China . As shown in Fig. 4, the monitoring system is composed\nof a total of 52 FBG strain sensors, 4 FBG temperature sensors, 11 accelerometers (tri-axial) and 1 noise sensor deployed on both motor and trailer bogies. Also, one tri-axial FBG accelerometer, one video camera and two GPS sensors are installed inside a train carriage. As the present work is focused on the real-time detection of potentially defective wheels by using strain monitoring data from bogies, only the deployment of strain sensors is concerned. The strain sensors are mounted\non 4 measurement zones of the bogies: (i) the zone with the action of high loads; (ii) the stress transmission zone; (iii)\nthe zone with high responses predicted by finite element analysis; and (iv) welded joints. FBG strain (and temperature) sensors are deployed and attached to the surface of the train bogie with industrial glue and tapes, and connected to the interrogator (data logger) with laptop inside the train carriage through optical fiber cables.\nThe data utilized in this study were obtained from a monitoring schedule spanning 18 days as shown in Table 1. The total length of the LUHSR between Lanzhou and Urumqi is 1777 km. In the trip from Lanzhou to Urumqi, the high-speed train\nstops by 14 stations and travels cross 13 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 13th); in trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou, the high-speed train stops by 15 stations and travels cross 14 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 14th). During the monitoring\nperiod, the train operated at its normal speed around 200–250 km/h. The sampling rate for all the sensors was set at 5000\nSince the train wheels were lathed (lathing is a process to make wheels perfectly rounded) during the monitoring period,\nthe recorded data contain information in line with two different states (before lathing and after lathing). The wheels can be considered as potentially unhealthy (defective) before lathing and as healthy after lathing. To verify the effectiveness of theproposed real-time defect detection methodology, the strain monitoring data obtained from the bogies before and afterThe train’s dynamic responses may be influenced by different subgrade conditions of the railroad, such as ground, tunnel,\nand bridge. To eliminate the effects of different railroad conditions, the strain data recorded from the same railroad sectionbefore and after lathing, are used in each scenario. In addition, the passenger loads in different trips are deemed statistically identical and the speed of train is assumed to be constant as in normal operation. Without loss of generality, the monitoring\ndata respectively obtained from two typical railroad sections (1st and 14th) in the trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou are chosen to illustrate the proposed real-time defect detection methodology, which are from the strain gauge (MS3-7) deployed at the For the sake of brevity, the monitoring data collected from the 1st railroad section are denoted as Case 1, while those from the 14th railroad section are denoted as Case 2. Firstly, the measured strain is converted to stress for the subsequent stress\nrange calculation. For the strain gauges mounted on the steel surface, the conversion of the measured strain to stress is made by rs ¼ Ee, where E is the elasticity modulus of steel and e is the strain after eliminating the effect of varying temperatures.where em is the measured strain, T m is the measured temperature in the vicinity of the strain sensor, T 0 is the temperature at\nthe installation, and a1 is a constant coefficient. In our case, the original temperature is 4, i.e., T 0 ¼ 4. The results of temperature compensation are demonstrated in Fig. 5. It is obvious that the trend in strain responses caused by temperature\nAfterwards, the stress ranges are extracted from the monitoring-derived stress data by the application of the rainflow\ncounting algorithm. From each stress cycle, the stress range Sa is obtained by calculating the difference between the maximum stress rmax and the minimum stress rmin measured in that stress cycle, i.e., Sa ¼ rmax rmin. More details on the stress ranges extraction are given in . The stress ranges with amplitudes lower than 1 MPa need to be culled because the majority are caused by noise. To decrease the uncertainty arising from the measurement facilities, the average stress ranges for\nevery ten minutes are used as the target quantities. Due to the different lengths of the two selected railroad sections (1st and 14th), the traveling time of the train in each section is also different. This results in different data lengths. The data\nlengths of the average stress ranges in Case 1 and Case 2 are 110 and 90, respectively. Figs. and 7 show the original measured strain responses before and after lathing in Case 1 and Case 2, respectively.Following the implementation procedures mentioned before, the defect detection results for Case 1 are demonstrated in\nFigs. and 9. Fig. 8(a) shows the average stress range (red point) together with 1-step ahead prediction (blue solid line) and\nthe corresponding 90% prediction interval (grey shadow). It is observed that, although some observations at the time interval t 2 fall outside the 90% prediction interval, only the Bayes factor at time t ¼ 55 exceeds the established threshold of Hmin ¼ 10 as shown in Fig. 9(a). It is thus judged as an outlier (marked as h). The reason is that because when applying the proposed approach, the shift parameter is set as h ¼ 1:645rt, resulting in the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt while the other\nfour observations are still within the uncertainty limit. On the other hand, Fig. 9(b)–(c) shows the results of the maximum cumulative Bayes factor and the corresponding run length for change detection. It is seen that the maximum cumulative\nBayes factor values at time instants t ¼ 56; 57 and 58 are larger than the threshold of Lmin ¼ 10, while merely the run length at instant t ¼ 58 surpasses the threshold of lmin ¼ 4. Apparently, this observation at time t ¼ 58 fulfills the conditions of change-point detection causing an alarm to be issued (i.e., TON ¼ 58). The identified real occurrence time of change-point is t ¼ 55 (i.e., TOC ¼ 58 4 þ 1 ¼ 55), which coincides well with the actual time point of lathing the wheels. In accordance\nwith the real-time identification of change-point occurrence, the prediction model is refined by altering the guessed mean\nvalue at TOC, as shown in Fig. 8(b). The predictions near TOC in the refined model obviously agree well with the actual observations, thus offering a better prediction performance than that of the original model.\nThe results of defect detection by means of Bayesian hypothesis testing are illustrated in Fig. 9(d). The discrimination between ‘‘healthy” and ‘‘defective” is quantified by the logarithm value of Bayes factor. It is seen from Fig. 9(d) that the vast\nmajority of logarithm values of Bayes factor before TOC are nearly zero and below the threshold level (dotted red line), which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘healthy state” (no defect). This is consistent with the actual health condition and thus validatesthe capability of the Bayesian hypothesis testing. On the contrary, all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than 2, meaning that the corresponding Bayes factor values exceed 100. According to the classification of Bayes factor stipulated in Sub-section 3.1, this result (H > 100) favors the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity is classified as ‘‘decisive”. Indeed, wheels immediately before being sent to depot for lathing were in the state of ‘heavily defective’.\nMaking use of Eq. (21), the probabilities of damage after TOC are obtained as 100%, that is, the wheels are identified as defective with a very high confidence.\nThe defect detection results for Case 2 are similar to Case 1, and are illustrated in Figs. and 11. As seen in Fig. 11(a)–(c)\nno outlier exists throughout the whole period, but a change-point is identified, of which the time of notification is t ¼ 44 (i.e.,\nTON ¼ 44) and the real time of occurrence is t ¼ 41 (i.e., TOC ¼ 44 4 þ 1 ¼ 41). The result matches well with the actual time point when wheel lathing is inflicted. For the predictions near the change-point, the modified prediction model\n(Fig. 10(b)) offers a better performance than the original model (Fig. 10(a)). As illustrated in Fig. 11(d), all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than the threshold (dotted red line), whereas the values before TOC are within thethreshold line. The values of Bayes factor after TOC are obtained to be higher than 100 (H > 100) and the corresponding probabilities of damage are approximately 100%, which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity\nApart from the accuracy of the proposed approach, the computational efficiency is also of concern. The algorithmic implementation is performed on a Lenovo ThinkCentre M720t desktop (Lenovo, Beijing, China) with Dual Intel Core i7-8700 processor (Intel, California, USA) and 24 GB of memory. The computation times consumed in Case 1 and Case 2 are 4.0109 s and\n3.7704 s respectively. In this sense, it realizes the detection of wheel defects in real time.5. ConclusionsA novel methodology for real-time defect detection of high-speed train wheels using Bayesian forecasting and dynamic linear model (DLM) has been developed and validated in this study. First, the DLM is formulated to approximate the actual\nframework. Afterwards, three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) are elicited for outlier detection and change-point detection. After the change-point has been confirmed, damage assessment is executed by the Bayesian hypothesis testing of the sequential observations before and after the change-point. Due to accommodating the dynamic evolution process and the statistical nature of the method, the proposed approach not only possesses the ability of real-time damage detection, but also enables damage quantification (through classifying the range of Bayes factor) and uncertainty assessment (through calculating the probability of damage). The methodology is illustrated by using the onlinelathing). In the two cases addressed, wheel defects are successfully identified, hence validating the effectiveness of the developed method. The quantitative results about the damage extent and confidence would provide useful information helping to\nmake cost-effective, risk-based decisions with the aim of maintaining the operation safety of high-speed rail.\nDespite the proposed methodology being developed for wheel defect detection of high-speed trains, it can also be applied to low-speed passenger and freight trains as well as extended to SHM for a wide variety of civil infrastructure (e.g., bridges,\nbuildings and tunnels) when vibration signals are available via monitoring. In this study, the second-order polynomial DLM\nis employed to model the stress ranges, which only considers the change of stress range level and trend. However, most longterm SHM data, especially long-term strain monitoring data, are generally contaminated by trend, seasonal (cyclical) and\nregression effects, which require a more complex model. The Bayesian DLM enables the modeling of time-dependent responses of a structure by integrating appropriate components, for instance, the response with cyclical characteristics\ncan be depicted by embedding a seasonal (cyclical) component. Thus, in accordance with the nature of monitoring data,\nan appropriate Bayesian DLM enabling to describe time series data of different features, can be formulated for damage detection of a variety of structures subject to different operational/environmental conditions.Administrative Region, China (Project No. PolyU 152024/17E).

IntroductionHigh-speed rail (HSR) is being developed in Asian and European countries to satisfy the rapidly growing demand for intercity services and to shore up economic growth. The rapid\ngrowth of HSR, however, has posed great challenges regarding operation safety, reliability\nand ride comfort. Irregular wheel defects can induce high-magnitude impact forces hindering safety and ride comfort of HSR and may also cause damage to rail tracks and vehicles.real time. The proposed methodology embraces logics for (i) prognosis, (ii) potential outlier\ndetection, (iii) identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and (iv) quantification of damage extent and uncertainty. Relying on the strain monitoring data acquired from high-speed train bogies, the Bayesian DLM for characterizing the actual stress ranges is established, by which one-step forecast distribution is elicited before proceeding to the\nnext observation. The detection of change-point is executed by comparing the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM) and an alternative model\n(the mean value is shifted by a prescribed offset) to determine which better fits the actual observation. If the comparison results are in favor of the alternative model, it is claimed that a potential change has occurred. Whether such an observation is an outlier or the beginning of a genuine change (change-point), three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum\ncumulative Bayes factor and run length) are performed for further identification.

Rail accidents were occasionally caused by failures such as severe defects or fatigue of railway components. To maintain a good service quality and operation safety, it is paramount to develop\nonline monitoring techniques that not only quickly recognize faults of mission-critical HSR components but also can anticipate of long-term mechanisms and gradual deterioration in performance.\nWheelsets in a high-speed train are physically connected with and controlled by the bogie system which corrects alignment for stable running and reduces the vibration caused by wheel-rail interaction . However, the wheel performance\nprogressively deteriorates in different mechanisms (e.g., wheel flat and wheel polygonization) during the routine operation of a high-speed train . Wheel performance deterioration increases stresses experienced by the bogie system. In addition,\nthe increased stress within bogie frames caused by wheel quality deterioration can be unexpectedly large, thus posing a serious threat to the operation safety of concerned trains. According to the statistics of train accidents caused by failure in\nmechanical components during 2004 to 2007 in the United States, the wheelsets faults are the most cause with a rate of\n44.7% . Therefore, the railway managers are keen to keep wheels in an adequate condition and detect potential failure\nas soon as possible. For railway wheels, there are three different ways of estimating the conditions: physical modeling, statistical modeling and condition monitoring . However, the first two ways are not applicable to in-service\nwheel condition assessment, and in contrast, the third way is most feasible for wheel condition estimation. The monitoring approaches available to wheel defect detection can be divided into in-workshop inspection and in-service detection . The\nlatter provides the real-time data required for maintenance planning, while the former is normally carried out at workshops at fixed intervals. The commonly used in-workshop methods for wheel defect inspection include the ultrasonic techniques, infrared camera and magnetic methods . In-service monitoring approaches can be categorized as on-board and wayside methods. The on-board methods implement sensors on the train and continuously obtain comprehensive data from\nthe system. The methods of this category include magnetic technique , ultrasonic technique , acoustic technique, and vibration technique . On the other hand, wayside methods attempt to detect the wheel or vehicle performance\nby installing sensors on the rail or its surrounding areas. Such indirect measurements give rise to limited information of the wheel condition while they can monitor all train wheels going by with using only one or a few sensors. According to the type\nof sensors used, wayside detection approaches include strain sensing technology , fiber optic sensing technology ,\nultrasonic technique , vibration technique , acoustic emission , lasers and high-speed cameras . However,\nthe study on data interpretation techniques enabling the extraction of defect-sensitive features is far from sufficient.\nBayesian dynamic linear model (DLM) is an elegant system approach to handling time series data from a Bayesian perspective, which originates from the field of applied statistics and is extensively used in other fields such as economics\nand engineering [25–30]. The Bayesian DLM treats the time series as the output of a dynamic system perturbed by random disturbances. It is suitable for modeling both univariate and multivariate time series, and also for representing the structural changes, non-stationarity and irregular patterns . Unlike the classical time series method which assumes a fixed relationship between the dependent variables (response variables) and the independent variables (regressors), the DLM considers\nthe relationship changes over time and is able to directly capture time series data features, such as trend, seasonality,\nand regression effects. Moreover, the DLM allows for descriptions of temporary or permanent shifts in time series parameters that occur abruptly, which are necessary for outlier and damage detection in structural health monitoring (SHM) paradigms. Recently, Goulet and his collaborator adopted the Bayesian DLM theory in SHM to model the time-dependent\nresponses of structures by breaking them into subcomponents. In the perspective of real-time damage detection, only few studies are available. The first attempt was conducted by Lipowsky et al. with the development of a Bayesian DLM-based\nreal-time detection algorithm to evaluate the performance of a gas turbine using simulated data. Later on, Wang et al.\nand Zhang et al. adopted the above algorithm for detecting high-speed train defects by using real-world monitoring\ndata. In the previous studies, however, the real-time detection algorithm devised possesses only outlier identification and\nchange detection abilities, without the function of damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.context of Bayesian DLM, which incorporates logics for prognosis, potential outlier detection, identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and damage extent and uncertainty quantification. The Bayesian DLM is considered as a tool\nfor time series analysis, while Bayesian forecasting is executed to enable the calculation of one-step ahead forecast distribution. The change-point detection is performed by checking the current observation against the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM for current instant) as well as against an alternative model of which the mean value\nis shifted by a prescribed offset. The detection rule is that if the alternative model better fits the actual observation, a potential change is signaled. To further determine whether such an observation is only an outlier or the beginning of an actual\nchange (change-point), a specific logic is developed by introducing the Bayes factor and the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.\nThe main contributions of this study are the provision of: (i) a formula which not only enables the modeling of actual framework; (ii) three metrics (i.e., the Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) to allow for outlier\nand change-point detection in real-time manner; and (iii) an efficient way for damage extent assessment and uncertainty\nquantification. The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the Bayesian DLM theory and an elaboration of the Bayesian forecasting philosophy. Section 3 presents the defect detection methodology that incorporates logics for\noutlier detection, change-point identification, and damage assessment. In Section 4, two case studies making use of timeseries strain data acquired by fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors affixed on the bogies of an in-service high-speed train are offered to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the proposed methodology. Finally, conclusions are drawn in2. Bayesian DLM and forecastingThe Bayesian DLM is a kind of process-based Bayesian prediction model which provides a flexible way to intuitively capture how processes evolve over time. It consists of two basic equations: an observation (measurement) equation and a system (evolution) equation . The observation (measurement) equation describes the relationship between the observed\nrandom vectors with mean zero and unknown covariance matrices V t and W t. The DLM defined above amounts to treating ht\nrange level at time t, and at represents the stress range change between time t 1 and t. v t is the zero-mean Gaussian random variable representing the error of measurement at moment t. x1t and x2t are both zero-mean Gaussian random variables representing the evolution of DLM from time t 1 to t. In association with the form of DLM in Equation (1), we haveThe Bayesian forecasting philosophy is based on the description of an observed process using its probability density function (PDF). As implied by the name, the Bayesian forecasting approach commences from Bayes’ theorem, hence enabling the calculation of conditional probabilities. The details of using DLM for the recursive one-step ahead forecasting of the (posterior) distribution of monitoring-derived stress ranges under the Bayesian framework are presented as follows\nNote that in Step 4, Atþ1 is the adaptive coefficient which can be viewed as the information tuner. It scales the correction term according to the relative variances of the prior and likelihood, as measured by Rtþ1=Q tþ1 and regressor value Ftþ1. etþ1 is\nthe one-step forward forecast error, the difference between the observed value ytþ1 and its expectation f tþ1. More details\nabout the recursive one-step ahead forecast method can be found in .3. Defect detection methodologyThe proposed defect detection methodology contains three logical processes: outlier detection, change-point detection,\nand damage assessment. By comparing the real-time measurement with the predicted values, the named outlier detection and change-point detection are devised to determine whether the measurement is a single outlier or the first observation of a remarkable change, the former being executed by calculating the Bayes factor, while the latter being based on the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once a change-point is affirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for further damagePotential outlier detection is the first step in the process of the proposed defect detection approach, accomplished by the Bayes factor calculation. Bayes factor is advocated because of its straightforward and natural interpretation of evidence afforded by data. At every time step t, the Bayesian DLM can yield a PDF for the next measurement, labeled as M0. Meanwhile, an artificial alternative model labeled as M1 is defined by shifting the mean of M0 by +h. The underlying idea of outlier\ndetection is to check the current observation against both M0 and M1. For each time step t, the Bayes factor is the ratio of thewhere yt is the measurement at time t and Dt1 refers to the history information up to time t 1. In the case of Gaussianwhere h is the shift value; yt is the observation value; f t and rt are the mean and standard deviation of the forecasting distribution for observation at time t. A Bayes factor H ¼ 1 indicates that the probability of the observation derived from model M1 is identical to the probability of that derived from Model M0. For better quantitative comparison between any two models, Jeffreys suggested interpreting the Bayes factor as a scale of evidence and provided descriptive statements although\nthe partitions are somewhat arbitrary. According to his suggestion, a Bayes factor can be divided into several intervals for assessing the significance of discrimination: 1 < H < 3 is ‘barely worth mentioning’, 3 < H < 10 is ‘substantial’,\n10 < H < 30 is ‘strong’, 30 < H < 100 is ‘very strong’, and H > 100 is ‘decisive’. In this study, Hmin ¼ 10 is set as a threshold\nAfter the confirmation of Hmin and h, an uncertainty limit (ucl) can be procured by the following equationFor instance, when the confidence level a and threshold of Bayes factor Hmin are set as 90% and 10 respectively, the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt. Thus, an observation is diagnosed as an outlier if its deviation from the mean value of M0 is larger\nWith the Bayes factor defined in Equation (9), only outliers with a positive deviation can be detected. To enable the outliers with negative deviation to be detected as well, a second Bayes factor is defined asIn the automatic monitoring process, both the Bayes factors H1;t and H2;t should be examined in parallel to enable thebehavior, rather than judgments based on long past performances. Change-point is an abrupt variation in time series data,\nrepresenting a transition that occurs between states. Change-point detection aims to detect abrupt change in the generative\nprocess of sequential data. It is assumed that a sequence of observations y1; ; yT could be divided into several nonoverlapping partitions, e.g. dataset j 1, dataset j, and dataset j + 1 as shown in Fig. 2. The delineations between partitions\nare known as change-points (e.g. TOC j 1 and TOC j); the goal of change-point detection is the determination of where the\nboundary of two adjacent partitions is located in a sequence of observations. Change-point detection approaches can be classified into offline and online methods. The former needs to observe the whole sequential observations before aiming to make\ninference on the generative process of the sequence [37–40], wheras the latter aims to update the inference at each time step\nwith the newly acquired measurements from the sequence [41–43]. In particular, the Bayesian online change-point detection methods are based on computing the probability distribution of the run length.differentiate between the single-point outlier and the beginning of a continual change. To overcome this problem, cumulative Bayes factor (local Bayes factors) is recommended to detect change-point(s) in the sequence of observations, by definingwhere lmax is the maximum number of Bayes factors taken into account. Unlike Bayes factor with implicitly no historical influence in the judgement, the consecutive Bayes factors collect evidence of change over a series of observation (from time\net al. . Akin to the Bayes factor threshold for outlier detection, the threshold of maximal cumulative Bayes factors is set as Lmin ¼ 10. If the conditions Lt > Lmin and lt > lmin occur simultaneously, an alarm of change is immediately issued at time t\n(time of notification, TON). The real time of occurrence (TOC) is (t lt þ 1), that is, TOC =t lt þ 1.Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is performed to assess damage extent and quantify the\nassociated uncertainty. The proposed approach directly quantifies the likelihoods of two scenarios (e.g., the sequential observations before and after the change-point), that is, ‘‘no fault” and ‘‘fault”, and the yielded results are easy to interpret. An\nadditional merit of the proposed approach is its ability to quantify the uncertainty in damage detection. Assume that the observed sequential data can be divided into two non-overlapping partitions, the first of which is regarded as healthy\nof the observations. Thus, the damage detection problem becomes the test of H0 : l ¼ l0 versus H1 : l–l0 with\nWith the above, damage detection can be achieved by means of Bayes factor which is defined as the ratio of the probability of observations given the alternate hypothesis to the probability of observations given the null hypothesiswhere D ¼ yf 1; ; yng refers to the observed data. It is proven to bewhere refers to the mean of the observed data fy1; ; yng. If no prior information is available, the initial mean and variance can be set as q ¼ l0 and s ¼ r 0 [][. The two assumptions take the prior mean and variance in the alternative hypothesis as]where z ¼ pfn **f** i ffi l0 0 [ At each time step (i.e.,][ n][=1), the Bayes factor][ B][ is larger for the larger values of][ z][j j][, which is reasonable]and easy to interpret. The logarithm of the Bayes factor, for convenience of comparison among a larger of values, is derived asIf the Bayes factor B10 is larger than 1, the implication is that the observed data provide evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis H1 (i.e., the structure is damaged). Otherwise, the observed data are judged to support the null hypothesis H0 (i.e.,\nthe structure is healthy). As with the previous threshold, B10 10 is set as a threshold for damage indication.\nIntegrating together the outlier detection, change-point detection and damage assessment, the implementation procedures of the proposed methodology are shown in Fig. 3. Beginning at time t, the single Bayes factor is firstly evaluated to\njudge whether yt is an outlier. If not, the maximum cumulative Bayes factor Lt and run length lt for change-point detection are calculated. Once a change-point is detected, the intervention is carried out by resetting the time to the time of occurrence\n(i.e., TOC = t lt þ 1) and by adjusting the mean value of M0 to the observation yt (i.e., f t ¼ yt), and the subsequent analysis\nwill then be started at TOC. Meanwhile, Bayesian hypothesis testing is executed for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification from the current TOC to the next TOC.4. Application to in-service monitoring data of high-speed trainAn onboard monitoring system has been designed and implemented on an in-service high-speed passenger train running on the Lanzhou-Urumqi High-Speed Railway (LUHSR) in China . As shown in Fig. 4, the monitoring system is composed\nof a total of 52 FBG strain sensors, 4 FBG temperature sensors, 11 accelerometers (tri-axial) and 1 noise sensor deployed on both motor and trailer bogies. Also, one tri-axial FBG accelerometer, one video camera and two GPS sensors are installed inside a train carriage. As the present work is focused on the real-time detection of potentially defective wheels by using strain monitoring data from bogies, only the deployment of strain sensors is concerned. The strain sensors are mounted\non 4 measurement zones of the bogies: (i) the zone with the action of high loads; (ii) the stress transmission zone; (iii)\nthe zone with high responses predicted by finite element analysis; and (iv) welded joints. FBG strain (and temperature) sensors are deployed and attached to the surface of the train bogie with industrial glue and tapes, and connected to the interrogator (data logger) with laptop inside the train carriage through optical fiber cables.\nThe data utilized in this study were obtained from a monitoring schedule spanning 18 days as shown in Table 1. The total length of the LUHSR between Lanzhou and Urumqi is 1777 km. In the trip from Lanzhou to Urumqi, the high-speed train\nstops by 14 stations and travels cross 13 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 13th); in trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou, the high-speed train stops by 15 stations and travels cross 14 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 14th). During the monitoring\nperiod, the train operated at its normal speed around 200–250 km/h. The sampling rate for all the sensors was set at 5000\nSince the train wheels were lathed (lathing is a process to make wheels perfectly rounded) during the monitoring period,\nthe recorded data contain information in line with two different states (before lathing and after lathing). The wheels can be considered as potentially unhealthy (defective) before lathing and as healthy after lathing. To verify the effectiveness of theproposed real-time defect detection methodology, the strain monitoring data obtained from the bogies before and afterThe train’s dynamic responses may be influenced by different subgrade conditions of the railroad, such as ground, tunnel,\nand bridge. To eliminate the effects of different railroad conditions, the strain data recorded from the same railroad sectionbefore and after lathing, are used in each scenario. In addition, the passenger loads in different trips are deemed statistically identical and the speed of train is assumed to be constant as in normal operation. Without loss of generality, the monitoring\ndata respectively obtained from two typical railroad sections (1st and 14th) in the trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou are chosen to illustrate the proposed real-time defect detection methodology, which are from the strain gauge (MS3-7) deployed at the For the sake of brevity, the monitoring data collected from the 1st railroad section are denoted as Case 1, while those from the 14th railroad section are denoted as Case 2. Firstly, the measured strain is converted to stress for the subsequent stress\nrange calculation. For the strain gauges mounted on the steel surface, the conversion of the measured strain to stress is made by rs ¼ Ee, where E is the elasticity modulus of steel and e is the strain after eliminating the effect of varying temperatures.where em is the measured strain, T m is the measured temperature in the vicinity of the strain sensor, T 0 is the temperature at\nthe installation, and a1 is a constant coefficient. In our case, the original temperature is 4, i.e., T 0 ¼ 4. The results of temperature compensation are demonstrated in Fig. 5. It is obvious that the trend in strain responses caused by temperature\nAfterwards, the stress ranges are extracted from the monitoring-derived stress data by the application of the rainflow\ncounting algorithm. From each stress cycle, the stress range Sa is obtained by calculating the difference between the maximum stress rmax and the minimum stress rmin measured in that stress cycle, i.e., Sa ¼ rmax rmin. More details on the stress ranges extraction are given in . The stress ranges with amplitudes lower than 1 MPa need to be culled because the majority are caused by noise. To decrease the uncertainty arising from the measurement facilities, the average stress ranges for\nevery ten minutes are used as the target quantities. Due to the different lengths of the two selected railroad sections (1st and 14th), the traveling time of the train in each section is also different. This results in different data lengths. The data\nlengths of the average stress ranges in Case 1 and Case 2 are 110 and 90, respectively. Figs. and 7 show the original measured strain responses before and after lathing in Case 1 and Case 2, respectively.Following the implementation procedures mentioned before, the defect detection results for Case 1 are demonstrated in\nFigs. and 9. Fig. 8(a) shows the average stress range (red point) together with 1-step ahead prediction (blue solid line) and\nthe corresponding 90% prediction interval (grey shadow). It is observed that, although some observations at the time interval t 2 fall outside the 90% prediction interval, only the Bayes factor at time t ¼ 55 exceeds the established threshold of Hmin ¼ 10 as shown in Fig. 9(a). It is thus judged as an outlier (marked as h). The reason is that because when applying the proposed approach, the shift parameter is set as h ¼ 1:645rt, resulting in the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt while the other\nfour observations are still within the uncertainty limit. On the other hand, Fig. 9(b)–(c) shows the results of the maximum cumulative Bayes factor and the corresponding run length for change detection. It is seen that the maximum cumulative\nBayes factor values at time instants t ¼ 56; 57 and 58 are larger than the threshold of Lmin ¼ 10, while merely the run length at instant t ¼ 58 surpasses the threshold of lmin ¼ 4. Apparently, this observation at time t ¼ 58 fulfills the conditions of change-point detection causing an alarm to be issued (i.e., TON ¼ 58). The identified real occurrence time of change-point is t ¼ 55 (i.e., TOC ¼ 58 4 þ 1 ¼ 55), which coincides well with the actual time point of lathing the wheels. In accordance\nwith the real-time identification of change-point occurrence, the prediction model is refined by altering the guessed mean\nvalue at TOC, as shown in Fig. 8(b). The predictions near TOC in the refined model obviously agree well with the actual observations, thus offering a better prediction performance than that of the original model.\nThe results of defect detection by means of Bayesian hypothesis testing are illustrated in Fig. 9(d). The discrimination between ‘‘healthy” and ‘‘defective” is quantified by the logarithm value of Bayes factor. It is seen from Fig. 9(d) that the vast\nmajority of logarithm values of Bayes factor before TOC are nearly zero and below the threshold level (dotted red line), which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘healthy state” (no defect). This is consistent with the actual health condition and thus validatesthe capability of the Bayesian hypothesis testing. On the contrary, all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than 2, meaning that the corresponding Bayes factor values exceed 100. According to the classification of Bayes factor stipulated in Sub-section 3.1, this result (H > 100) favors the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity is classified as ‘‘decisive”. Indeed, wheels immediately before being sent to depot for lathing were in the state of ‘heavily defective’.\nMaking use of Eq. (21), the probabilities of damage after TOC are obtained as 100%, that is, the wheels are identified as defective with a very high confidence.\nThe defect detection results for Case 2 are similar to Case 1, and are illustrated in Figs. and 11. As seen in Fig. 11(a)–(c)\nno outlier exists throughout the whole period, but a change-point is identified, of which the time of notification is t ¼ 44 (i.e.,\nTON ¼ 44) and the real time of occurrence is t ¼ 41 (i.e., TOC ¼ 44 4 þ 1 ¼ 41). The result matches well with the actual time point when wheel lathing is inflicted. For the predictions near the change-point, the modified prediction model\n(Fig. 10(b)) offers a better performance than the original model (Fig. 10(a)). As illustrated in Fig. 11(d), all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than the threshold (dotted red line), whereas the values before TOC are within thethreshold line. The values of Bayes factor after TOC are obtained to be higher than 100 (H > 100) and the corresponding probabilities of damage are approximately 100%, which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity\nApart from the accuracy of the proposed approach, the computational efficiency is also of concern. The algorithmic implementation is performed on a Lenovo ThinkCentre M720t desktop (Lenovo, Beijing, China) with Dual Intel Core i7-8700 processor (Intel, California, USA) and 24 GB of memory. The computation times consumed in Case 1 and Case 2 are 4.0109 s and\n3.7704 s respectively. In this sense, it realizes the detection of wheel defects in real time.5. ConclusionsA novel methodology for real-time defect detection of high-speed train wheels using Bayesian forecasting and dynamic linear model (DLM) has been developed and validated in this study. First, the DLM is formulated to approximate the actual\nframework. Afterwards, three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) are elicited for outlier detection and change-point detection. After the change-point has been confirmed, damage assessment is executed by the Bayesian hypothesis testing of the sequential observations before and after the change-point. Due to accommodating the dynamic evolution process and the statistical nature of the method, the proposed approach not only possesses the ability of real-time damage detection, but also enables damage quantification (through classifying the range of Bayes factor) and uncertainty assessment (through calculating the probability of damage). The methodology is illustrated by using the onlinelathing). In the two cases addressed, wheel defects are successfully identified, hence validating the effectiveness of the developed method. The quantitative results about the damage extent and confidence would provide useful information helping to\nmake cost-effective, risk-based decisions with the aim of maintaining the operation safety of high-speed rail.\nDespite the proposed methodology being developed for wheel defect detection of high-speed trains, it can also be applied to low-speed passenger and freight trains as well as extended to SHM for a wide variety of civil infrastructure (e.g., bridges,\nbuildings and tunnels) when vibration signals are available via monitoring. In this study, the second-order polynomial DLM\nis employed to model the stress ranges, which only considers the change of stress range level and trend. However, most longterm SHM data, especially long-term strain monitoring data, are generally contaminated by trend, seasonal (cyclical) and\nregression effects, which require a more complex model. The Bayesian DLM enables the modeling of time-dependent responses of a structure by integrating appropriate components, for instance, the response with cyclical characteristics\ncan be depicted by embedding a seasonal (cyclical) component. Thus, in accordance with the nature of monitoring data,\nan appropriate Bayesian DLM enabling to describe time series data of different features, can be formulated for damage detection of a variety of structures subject to different operational/environmental conditions.Administrative Region, China (Project No. PolyU 152024/17E).

IntroductionHigh-speed rail (HSR) is being developed in Asian and European countries to satisfy the rapidly growing demand for intercity services and to shore up economic growth. The rapid\ngrowth of HSR, however, has posed great challenges regarding operation safety, reliability\nand ride comfort. Irregular wheel defects can induce high-magnitude impact forces hindering safety and ride comfort of HSR and may also cause damage to rail tracks and vehicles.real time. The proposed methodology embraces logics for (i) prognosis, (ii) potential outlier\ndetection, (iii) identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and (iv) quantification of damage extent and uncertainty. Relying on the strain monitoring data acquired from high-speed train bogies, the Bayesian DLM for characterizing the actual stress ranges is established, by which one-step forecast distribution is elicited before proceeding to the\nnext observation. The detection of change-point is executed by comparing the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM) and an alternative model\n(the mean value is shifted by a prescribed offset) to determine which better fits the actual observation. If the comparison results are in favor of the alternative model, it is claimed that a potential change has occurred. Whether such an observation is an outlier or the beginning of a genuine change (change-point), three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum\ncumulative Bayes factor and run length) are performed for further identification.

Rail accidents were occasionally caused by failures such as severe defects or fatigue of railway components. To maintain a good service quality and operation safety, it is paramount to develop\nonline monitoring techniques that not only quickly recognize faults of mission-critical HSR components but also can anticipate of long-term mechanisms and gradual deterioration in performance.\nWheelsets in a high-speed train are physically connected with and controlled by the bogie system which corrects alignment for stable running and reduces the vibration caused by wheel-rail interaction . However, the wheel performance\nprogressively deteriorates in different mechanisms (e.g., wheel flat and wheel polygonization) during the routine operation of a high-speed train . Wheel performance deterioration increases stresses experienced by the bogie system. In addition,\nthe increased stress within bogie frames caused by wheel quality deterioration can be unexpectedly large, thus posing a serious threat to the operation safety of concerned trains. According to the statistics of train accidents caused by failure in\nmechanical components during 2004 to 2007 in the United States, the wheelsets faults are the most cause with a rate of\n44.7% . Therefore, the railway managers are keen to keep wheels in an adequate condition and detect potential failure\nas soon as possible. For railway wheels, there are three different ways of estimating the conditions: physical modeling, statistical modeling and condition monitoring . However, the first two ways are not applicable to in-service\nwheel condition assessment, and in contrast, the third way is most feasible for wheel condition estimation. The monitoring approaches available to wheel defect detection can be divided into in-workshop inspection and in-service detection . The\nlatter provides the real-time data required for maintenance planning, while the former is normally carried out at workshops at fixed intervals. The commonly used in-workshop methods for wheel defect inspection include the ultrasonic techniques, infrared camera and magnetic methods . In-service monitoring approaches can be categorized as on-board and wayside methods. The on-board methods implement sensors on the train and continuously obtain comprehensive data from\nthe system. The methods of this category include magnetic technique , ultrasonic technique , acoustic technique, and vibration technique . On the other hand, wayside methods attempt to detect the wheel or vehicle performance\nby installing sensors on the rail or its surrounding areas. Such indirect measurements give rise to limited information of the wheel condition while they can monitor all train wheels going by with using only one or a few sensors. According to the type\nof sensors used, wayside detection approaches include strain sensing technology , fiber optic sensing technology ,\nultrasonic technique , vibration technique , acoustic emission , lasers and high-speed cameras . However,\nthe study on data interpretation techniques enabling the extraction of defect-sensitive features is far from sufficient.\nBayesian dynamic linear model (DLM) is an elegant system approach to handling time series data from a Bayesian perspective, which originates from the field of applied statistics and is extensively used in other fields such as economics\nand engineering [25–30]. The Bayesian DLM treats the time series as the output of a dynamic system perturbed by random disturbances. It is suitable for modeling both univariate and multivariate time series, and also for representing the structural changes, non-stationarity and irregular patterns . Unlike the classical time series method which assumes a fixed relationship between the dependent variables (response variables) and the independent variables (regressors), the DLM considers\nthe relationship changes over time and is able to directly capture time series data features, such as trend, seasonality,\nand regression effects. Moreover, the DLM allows for descriptions of temporary or permanent shifts in time series parameters that occur abruptly, which are necessary for outlier and damage detection in structural health monitoring (SHM) paradigms. Recently, Goulet and his collaborator adopted the Bayesian DLM theory in SHM to model the time-dependent\nresponses of structures by breaking them into subcomponents. In the perspective of real-time damage detection, only few studies are available. The first attempt was conducted by Lipowsky et al. with the development of a Bayesian DLM-based\nreal-time detection algorithm to evaluate the performance of a gas turbine using simulated data. Later on, Wang et al.\nand Zhang et al. adopted the above algorithm for detecting high-speed train defects by using real-world monitoring\ndata. In the previous studies, however, the real-time detection algorithm devised possesses only outlier identification and\nchange detection abilities, without the function of damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.context of Bayesian DLM, which incorporates logics for prognosis, potential outlier detection, identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and damage extent and uncertainty quantification. The Bayesian DLM is considered as a tool\nfor time series analysis, while Bayesian forecasting is executed to enable the calculation of one-step ahead forecast distribution. The change-point detection is performed by checking the current observation against the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM for current instant) as well as against an alternative model of which the mean value\nis shifted by a prescribed offset. The detection rule is that if the alternative model better fits the actual observation, a potential change is signaled. To further determine whether such an observation is only an outlier or the beginning of an actual\nchange (change-point), a specific logic is developed by introducing the Bayes factor and the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.\nThe main contributions of this study are the provision of: (i) a formula which not only enables the modeling of actual framework; (ii) three metrics (i.e., the Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) to allow for outlier\nand change-point detection in real-time manner; and (iii) an efficient way for damage extent assessment and uncertainty\nquantification. The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the Bayesian DLM theory and an elaboration of the Bayesian forecasting philosophy. Section 3 presents the defect detection methodology that incorporates logics for\noutlier detection, change-point identification, and damage assessment. In Section 4, two case studies making use of timeseries strain data acquired by fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors affixed on the bogies of an in-service high-speed train are offered to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the proposed methodology. Finally, conclusions are drawn in2. Bayesian DLM and forecastingThe Bayesian DLM is a kind of process-based Bayesian prediction model which provides a flexible way to intuitively capture how processes evolve over time. It consists of two basic equations: an observation (measurement) equation and a system (evolution) equation . The observation (measurement) equation describes the relationship between the observed\nrandom vectors with mean zero and unknown covariance matrices V t and W t. The DLM defined above amounts to treating ht\nrange level at time t, and at represents the stress range change between time t 1 and t. v t is the zero-mean Gaussian random variable representing the error of measurement at moment t. x1t and x2t are both zero-mean Gaussian random variables representing the evolution of DLM from time t 1 to t. In association with the form of DLM in Equation (1), we haveThe Bayesian forecasting philosophy is based on the description of an observed process using its probability density function (PDF). As implied by the name, the Bayesian forecasting approach commences from Bayes’ theorem, hence enabling the calculation of conditional probabilities. The details of using DLM for the recursive one-step ahead forecasting of the (posterior) distribution of monitoring-derived stress ranges under the Bayesian framework are presented as follows\nNote that in Step 4, Atþ1 is the adaptive coefficient which can be viewed as the information tuner. It scales the correction term according to the relative variances of the prior and likelihood, as measured by Rtþ1=Q tþ1 and regressor value Ftþ1. etþ1 is\nthe one-step forward forecast error, the difference between the observed value ytþ1 and its expectation f tþ1. More details\nabout the recursive one-step ahead forecast method can be found in .3. Defect detection methodologyThe proposed defect detection methodology contains three logical processes: outlier detection, change-point detection,\nand damage assessment. By comparing the real-time measurement with the predicted values, the named outlier detection and change-point detection are devised to determine whether the measurement is a single outlier or the first observation of a remarkable change, the former being executed by calculating the Bayes factor, while the latter being based on the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once a change-point is affirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for further damagePotential outlier detection is the first step in the process of the proposed defect detection approach, accomplished by the Bayes factor calculation. Bayes factor is advocated because of its straightforward and natural interpretation of evidence afforded by data. At every time step t, the Bayesian DLM can yield a PDF for the next measurement, labeled as M0. Meanwhile, an artificial alternative model labeled as M1 is defined by shifting the mean of M0 by +h. The underlying idea of outlier\ndetection is to check the current observation against both M0 and M1. For each time step t, the Bayes factor is the ratio of thewhere yt is the measurement at time t and Dt1 refers to the history information up to time t 1. In the case of Gaussianwhere h is the shift value; yt is the observation value; f t and rt are the mean and standard deviation of the forecasting distribution for observation at time t. A Bayes factor H ¼ 1 indicates that the probability of the observation derived from model M1 is identical to the probability of that derived from Model M0. For better quantitative comparison between any two models, Jeffreys suggested interpreting the Bayes factor as a scale of evidence and provided descriptive statements although\nthe partitions are somewhat arbitrary. According to his suggestion, a Bayes factor can be divided into several intervals for assessing the significance of discrimination: 1 < H < 3 is ‘barely worth mentioning’, 3 < H < 10 is ‘substantial’,\n10 < H < 30 is ‘strong’, 30 < H < 100 is ‘very strong’, and H > 100 is ‘decisive’. In this study, Hmin ¼ 10 is set as a threshold\nAfter the confirmation of Hmin and h, an uncertainty limit (ucl) can be procured by the following equationFor instance, when the confidence level a and threshold of Bayes factor Hmin are set as 90% and 10 respectively, the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt. Thus, an observation is diagnosed as an outlier if its deviation from the mean value of M0 is larger\nWith the Bayes factor defined in Equation (9), only outliers with a positive deviation can be detected. To enable the outliers with negative deviation to be detected as well, a second Bayes factor is defined asIn the automatic monitoring process, both the Bayes factors H1;t and H2;t should be examined in parallel to enable thebehavior, rather than judgments based on long past performances. Change-point is an abrupt variation in time series data,\nrepresenting a transition that occurs between states. Change-point detection aims to detect abrupt change in the generative\nprocess of sequential data. It is assumed that a sequence of observations y1; ; yT could be divided into several nonoverlapping partitions, e.g. dataset j 1, dataset j, and dataset j + 1 as shown in Fig. 2. The delineations between partitions\nare known as change-points (e.g. TOC j 1 and TOC j); the goal of change-point detection is the determination of where the\nboundary of two adjacent partitions is located in a sequence of observations. Change-point detection approaches can be classified into offline and online methods. The former needs to observe the whole sequential observations before aiming to make\ninference on the generative process of the sequence [37–40], wheras the latter aims to update the inference at each time step\nwith the newly acquired measurements from the sequence [41–43]. In particular, the Bayesian online change-point detection methods are based on computing the probability distribution of the run length.differentiate between the single-point outlier and the beginning of a continual change. To overcome this problem, cumulative Bayes factor (local Bayes factors) is recommended to detect change-point(s) in the sequence of observations, by definingwhere lmax is the maximum number of Bayes factors taken into account. Unlike Bayes factor with implicitly no historical influence in the judgement, the consecutive Bayes factors collect evidence of change over a series of observation (from time\net al. . Akin to the Bayes factor threshold for outlier detection, the threshold of maximal cumulative Bayes factors is set as Lmin ¼ 10. If the conditions Lt > Lmin and lt > lmin occur simultaneously, an alarm of change is immediately issued at time t\n(time of notification, TON). The real time of occurrence (TOC) is (t lt þ 1), that is, TOC =t lt þ 1.Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is performed to assess damage extent and quantify the\nassociated uncertainty. The proposed approach directly quantifies the likelihoods of two scenarios (e.g., the sequential observations before and after the change-point), that is, ‘‘no fault” and ‘‘fault”, and the yielded results are easy to interpret. An\nadditional merit of the proposed approach is its ability to quantify the uncertainty in damage detection. Assume that the observed sequential data can be divided into two non-overlapping partitions, the first of which is regarded as healthy\nof the observations. Thus, the damage detection problem becomes the test of H0 : l ¼ l0 versus H1 : l–l0 with\nWith the above, damage detection can be achieved by means of Bayes factor which is defined as the ratio of the probability of observations given the alternate hypothesis to the probability of observations given the null hypothesiswhere D ¼ yf 1; ; yng refers to the observed data. It is proven to bewhere refers to the mean of the observed data fy1; ; yng. If no prior information is available, the initial mean and variance can be set as q ¼ l0 and s ¼ r 0 [][. The two assumptions take the prior mean and variance in the alternative hypothesis as]where z ¼ pfn **f** i ffi l0 0 [ At each time step (i.e.,][ n][=1), the Bayes factor][ B][ is larger for the larger values of][ z][j j][, which is reasonable]and easy to interpret. The logarithm of the Bayes factor, for convenience of comparison among a larger of values, is derived asIf the Bayes factor B10 is larger than 1, the implication is that the observed data provide evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis H1 (i.e., the structure is damaged). Otherwise, the observed data are judged to support the null hypothesis H0 (i.e.,\nthe structure is healthy). As with the previous threshold, B10 10 is set as a threshold for damage indication.\nIntegrating together the outlier detection, change-point detection and damage assessment, the implementation procedures of the proposed methodology are shown in Fig. 3. Beginning at time t, the single Bayes factor is firstly evaluated to\njudge whether yt is an outlier. If not, the maximum cumulative Bayes factor Lt and run length lt for change-point detection are calculated. Once a change-point is detected, the intervention is carried out by resetting the time to the time of occurrence\n(i.e., TOC = t lt þ 1) and by adjusting the mean value of M0 to the observation yt (i.e., f t ¼ yt), and the subsequent analysis\nwill then be started at TOC. Meanwhile, Bayesian hypothesis testing is executed for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification from the current TOC to the next TOC.4. Application to in-service monitoring data of high-speed trainAn onboard monitoring system has been designed and implemented on an in-service high-speed passenger train running on the Lanzhou-Urumqi High-Speed Railway (LUHSR) in China . As shown in Fig. 4, the monitoring system is composed\nof a total of 52 FBG strain sensors, 4 FBG temperature sensors, 11 accelerometers (tri-axial) and 1 noise sensor deployed on both motor and trailer bogies. Also, one tri-axial FBG accelerometer, one video camera and two GPS sensors are installed inside a train carriage. As the present work is focused on the real-time detection of potentially defective wheels by using strain monitoring data from bogies, only the deployment of strain sensors is concerned. The strain sensors are mounted\non 4 measurement zones of the bogies: (i) the zone with the action of high loads; (ii) the stress transmission zone; (iii)\nthe zone with high responses predicted by finite element analysis; and (iv) welded joints. FBG strain (and temperature) sensors are deployed and attached to the surface of the train bogie with industrial glue and tapes, and connected to the interrogator (data logger) with laptop inside the train carriage through optical fiber cables.\nThe data utilized in this study were obtained from a monitoring schedule spanning 18 days as shown in Table 1. The total length of the LUHSR between Lanzhou and Urumqi is 1777 km. In the trip from Lanzhou to Urumqi, the high-speed train\nstops by 14 stations and travels cross 13 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 13th); in trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou, the high-speed train stops by 15 stations and travels cross 14 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 14th). During the monitoring\nperiod, the train operated at its normal speed around 200–250 km/h. The sampling rate for all the sensors was set at 5000\nSince the train wheels were lathed (lathing is a process to make wheels perfectly rounded) during the monitoring period,\nthe recorded data contain information in line with two different states (before lathing and after lathing). The wheels can be considered as potentially unhealthy (defective) before lathing and as healthy after lathing. To verify the effectiveness of theproposed real-time defect detection methodology, the strain monitoring data obtained from the bogies before and afterThe train’s dynamic responses may be influenced by different subgrade conditions of the railroad, such as ground, tunnel,\nand bridge. To eliminate the effects of different railroad conditions, the strain data recorded from the same railroad sectionbefore and after lathing, are used in each scenario. In addition, the passenger loads in different trips are deemed statistically identical and the speed of train is assumed to be constant as in normal operation. Without loss of generality, the monitoring\ndata respectively obtained from two typical railroad sections (1st and 14th) in the trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou are chosen to illustrate the proposed real-time defect detection methodology, which are from the strain gauge (MS3-7) deployed at the For the sake of brevity, the monitoring data collected from the 1st railroad section are denoted as Case 1, while those from the 14th railroad section are denoted as Case 2. Firstly, the measured strain is converted to stress for the subsequent stress\nrange calculation. For the strain gauges mounted on the steel surface, the conversion of the measured strain to stress is made by rs ¼ Ee, where E is the elasticity modulus of steel and e is the strain after eliminating the effect of varying temperatures.where em is the measured strain, T m is the measured temperature in the vicinity of the strain sensor, T 0 is the temperature at\nthe installation, and a1 is a constant coefficient. In our case, the original temperature is 4, i.e., T 0 ¼ 4. The results of temperature compensation are demonstrated in Fig. 5. It is obvious that the trend in strain responses caused by temperature\nAfterwards, the stress ranges are extracted from the monitoring-derived stress data by the application of the rainflow\ncounting algorithm. From each stress cycle, the stress range Sa is obtained by calculating the difference between the maximum stress rmax and the minimum stress rmin measured in that stress cycle, i.e., Sa ¼ rmax rmin. More details on the stress ranges extraction are given in . The stress ranges with amplitudes lower than 1 MPa need to be culled because the majority are caused by noise. To decrease the uncertainty arising from the measurement facilities, the average stress ranges for\nevery ten minutes are used as the target quantities. Due to the different lengths of the two selected railroad sections (1st and 14th), the traveling time of the train in each section is also different. This results in different data lengths. The data\nlengths of the average stress ranges in Case 1 and Case 2 are 110 and 90, respectively. Figs. and 7 show the original measured strain responses before and after lathing in Case 1 and Case 2, respectively.Following the implementation procedures mentioned before, the defect detection results for Case 1 are demonstrated in\nFigs. and 9. Fig. 8(a) shows the average stress range (red point) together with 1-step ahead prediction (blue solid line) and\nthe corresponding 90% prediction interval (grey shadow). It is observed that, although some observations at the time interval t 2 fall outside the 90% prediction interval, only the Bayes factor at time t ¼ 55 exceeds the established threshold of Hmin ¼ 10 as shown in Fig. 9(a). It is thus judged as an outlier (marked as h). The reason is that because when applying the proposed approach, the shift parameter is set as h ¼ 1:645rt, resulting in the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt while the other\nfour observations are still within the uncertainty limit. On the other hand, Fig. 9(b)–(c) shows the results of the maximum cumulative Bayes factor and the corresponding run length for change detection. It is seen that the maximum cumulative\nBayes factor values at time instants t ¼ 56; 57 and 58 are larger than the threshold of Lmin ¼ 10, while merely the run length at instant t ¼ 58 surpasses the threshold of lmin ¼ 4. Apparently, this observation at time t ¼ 58 fulfills the conditions of change-point detection causing an alarm to be issued (i.e., TON ¼ 58). The identified real occurrence time of change-point is t ¼ 55 (i.e., TOC ¼ 58 4 þ 1 ¼ 55), which coincides well with the actual time point of lathing the wheels. In accordance\nwith the real-time identification of change-point occurrence, the prediction model is refined by altering the guessed mean\nvalue at TOC, as shown in Fig. 8(b). The predictions near TOC in the refined model obviously agree well with the actual observations, thus offering a better prediction performance than that of the original model.\nThe results of defect detection by means of Bayesian hypothesis testing are illustrated in Fig. 9(d). The discrimination between ‘‘healthy” and ‘‘defective” is quantified by the logarithm value of Bayes factor. It is seen from Fig. 9(d) that the vast\nmajority of logarithm values of Bayes factor before TOC are nearly zero and below the threshold level (dotted red line), which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘healthy state” (no defect). This is consistent with the actual health condition and thus validatesthe capability of the Bayesian hypothesis testing. On the contrary, all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than 2, meaning that the corresponding Bayes factor values exceed 100. According to the classification of Bayes factor stipulated in Sub-section 3.1, this result (H > 100) favors the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity is classified as ‘‘decisive”. Indeed, wheels immediately before being sent to depot for lathing were in the state of ‘heavily defective’.\nMaking use of Eq. (21), the probabilities of damage after TOC are obtained as 100%, that is, the wheels are identified as defective with a very high confidence.\nThe defect detection results for Case 2 are similar to Case 1, and are illustrated in Figs. and 11. As seen in Fig. 11(a)–(c)\nno outlier exists throughout the whole period, but a change-point is identified, of which the time of notification is t ¼ 44 (i.e.,\nTON ¼ 44) and the real time of occurrence is t ¼ 41 (i.e., TOC ¼ 44 4 þ 1 ¼ 41). The result matches well with the actual time point when wheel lathing is inflicted. For the predictions near the change-point, the modified prediction model\n(Fig. 10(b)) offers a better performance than the original model (Fig. 10(a)). As illustrated in Fig. 11(d), all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than the threshold (dotted red line), whereas the values before TOC are within thethreshold line. The values of Bayes factor after TOC are obtained to be higher than 100 (H > 100) and the corresponding probabilities of damage are approximately 100%, which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity\nApart from the accuracy of the proposed approach, the computational efficiency is also of concern. The algorithmic implementation is performed on a Lenovo ThinkCentre M720t desktop (Lenovo, Beijing, China) with Dual Intel Core i7-8700 processor (Intel, California, USA) and 24 GB of memory. The computation times consumed in Case 1 and Case 2 are 4.0109 s and\n3.7704 s respectively. In this sense, it realizes the detection of wheel defects in real time.5. ConclusionsA novel methodology for real-time defect detection of high-speed train wheels using Bayesian forecasting and dynamic linear model (DLM) has been developed and validated in this study. First, the DLM is formulated to approximate the actual\nframework. Afterwards, three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) are elicited for outlier detection and change-point detection. After the change-point has been confirmed, damage assessment is executed by the Bayesian hypothesis testing of the sequential observations before and after the change-point. Due to accommodating the dynamic evolution process and the statistical nature of the method, the proposed approach not only possesses the ability of real-time damage detection, but also enables damage quantification (through classifying the range of Bayes factor) and uncertainty assessment (through calculating the probability of damage). The methodology is illustrated by using the onlinelathing). In the two cases addressed, wheel defects are successfully identified, hence validating the effectiveness of the developed method. The quantitative results about the damage extent and confidence would provide useful information helping to\nmake cost-effective, risk-based decisions with the aim of maintaining the operation safety of high-speed rail.\nDespite the proposed methodology being developed for wheel defect detection of high-speed trains, it can also be applied to low-speed passenger and freight trains as well as extended to SHM for a wide variety of civil infrastructure (e.g., bridges,\nbuildings and tunnels) when vibration signals are available via monitoring. In this study, the second-order polynomial DLM\nis employed to model the stress ranges, which only considers the change of stress range level and trend. However, most longterm SHM data, especially long-term strain monitoring data, are generally contaminated by trend, seasonal (cyclical) and\nregression effects, which require a more complex model. The Bayesian DLM enables the modeling of time-dependent responses of a structure by integrating appropriate components, for instance, the response with cyclical characteristics\ncan be depicted by embedding a seasonal (cyclical) component. Thus, in accordance with the nature of monitoring data,\nan appropriate Bayesian DLM enabling to describe time series data of different features, can be formulated for damage detection of a variety of structures subject to different operational/environmental conditions.Administrative Region, China (Project No. PolyU 152024/17E).

IntroductionHigh-speed rail (HSR) is being developed in Asian and European countries to satisfy the rapidly growing demand for intercity services and to shore up economic growth. The rapid\ngrowth of HSR, however, has posed great challenges regarding operation safety, reliability\nand ride comfort. Irregular wheel defects can induce high-magnitude impact forces hindering safety and ride comfort of HSR and may also cause damage to rail tracks and vehicles.real time. The proposed methodology embraces logics for (i) prognosis, (ii) potential outlier\ndetection, (iii) identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and (iv) quantification of damage extent and uncertainty. Relying on the strain monitoring data acquired from high-speed train bogies, the Bayesian DLM for characterizing the actual stress ranges is established, by which one-step forecast distribution is elicited before proceeding to the\nnext observation. The detection of change-point is executed by comparing the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM) and an alternative model\n(the mean value is shifted by a prescribed offset) to determine which better fits the actual observation. If the comparison results are in favor of the alternative model, it is claimed that a potential change has occurred. Whether such an observation is an outlier or the beginning of a genuine change (change-point), three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum\ncumulative Bayes factor and run length) are performed for further identification.

Rail accidents were occasionally caused by failures such as severe defects or fatigue of railway components. To maintain a good service quality and operation safety, it is paramount to develop\nonline monitoring techniques that not only quickly recognize faults of mission-critical HSR components but also can anticipate of long-term mechanisms and gradual deterioration in performance.\nWheelsets in a high-speed train are physically connected with and controlled by the bogie system which corrects alignment for stable running and reduces the vibration caused by wheel-rail interaction . However, the wheel performance\nprogressively deteriorates in different mechanisms (e.g., wheel flat and wheel polygonization) during the routine operation of a high-speed train . Wheel performance deterioration increases stresses experienced by the bogie system. In addition,\nthe increased stress within bogie frames caused by wheel quality deterioration can be unexpectedly large, thus posing a serious threat to the operation safety of concerned trains. According to the statistics of train accidents caused by failure in\nmechanical components during 2004 to 2007 in the United States, the wheelsets faults are the most cause with a rate of\n44.7% . Therefore, the railway managers are keen to keep wheels in an adequate condition and detect potential failure\nas soon as possible. For railway wheels, there are three different ways of estimating the conditions: physical modeling, statistical modeling and condition monitoring . However, the first two ways are not applicable to in-service\nwheel condition assessment, and in contrast, the third way is most feasible for wheel condition estimation. The monitoring approaches available to wheel defect detection can be divided into in-workshop inspection and in-service detection . The\nlatter provides the real-time data required for maintenance planning, while the former is normally carried out at workshops at fixed intervals. The commonly used in-workshop methods for wheel defect inspection include the ultrasonic techniques, infrared camera and magnetic methods . In-service monitoring approaches can be categorized as on-board and wayside methods. The on-board methods implement sensors on the train and continuously obtain comprehensive data from\nthe system. The methods of this category include magnetic technique , ultrasonic technique , acoustic technique, and vibration technique . On the other hand, wayside methods attempt to detect the wheel or vehicle performance\nby installing sensors on the rail or its surrounding areas. Such indirect measurements give rise to limited information of the wheel condition while they can monitor all train wheels going by with using only one or a few sensors. According to the type\nof sensors used, wayside detection approaches include strain sensing technology , fiber optic sensing technology ,\nultrasonic technique , vibration technique , acoustic emission , lasers and high-speed cameras . However,\nthe study on data interpretation techniques enabling the extraction of defect-sensitive features is far from sufficient.\nBayesian dynamic linear model (DLM) is an elegant system approach to handling time series data from a Bayesian perspective, which originates from the field of applied statistics and is extensively used in other fields such as economics\nand engineering [25–30]. The Bayesian DLM treats the time series as the output of a dynamic system perturbed by random disturbances. It is suitable for modeling both univariate and multivariate time series, and also for representing the structural changes, non-stationarity and irregular patterns . Unlike the classical time series method which assumes a fixed relationship between the dependent variables (response variables) and the independent variables (regressors), the DLM considers\nthe relationship changes over time and is able to directly capture time series data features, such as trend, seasonality,\nand regression effects. Moreover, the DLM allows for descriptions of temporary or permanent shifts in time series parameters that occur abruptly, which are necessary for outlier and damage detection in structural health monitoring (SHM) paradigms. Recently, Goulet and his collaborator adopted the Bayesian DLM theory in SHM to model the time-dependent\nresponses of structures by breaking them into subcomponents. In the perspective of real-time damage detection, only few studies are available. The first attempt was conducted by Lipowsky et al. with the development of a Bayesian DLM-based\nreal-time detection algorithm to evaluate the performance of a gas turbine using simulated data. Later on, Wang et al.\nand Zhang et al. adopted the above algorithm for detecting high-speed train defects by using real-world monitoring\ndata. In the previous studies, however, the real-time detection algorithm devised possesses only outlier identification and\nchange detection abilities, without the function of damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.context of Bayesian DLM, which incorporates logics for prognosis, potential outlier detection, identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and damage extent and uncertainty quantification. The Bayesian DLM is considered as a tool\nfor time series analysis, while Bayesian forecasting is executed to enable the calculation of one-step ahead forecast distribution. The change-point detection is performed by checking the current observation against the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM for current instant) as well as against an alternative model of which the mean value\nis shifted by a prescribed offset. The detection rule is that if the alternative model better fits the actual observation, a potential change is signaled. To further determine whether such an observation is only an outlier or the beginning of an actual\nchange (change-point), a specific logic is developed by introducing the Bayes factor and the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.\nThe main contributions of this study are the provision of: (i) a formula which not only enables the modeling of actual framework; (ii) three metrics (i.e., the Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) to allow for outlier\nand change-point detection in real-time manner; and (iii) an efficient way for damage extent assessment and uncertainty\nquantification. The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the Bayesian DLM theory and an elaboration of the Bayesian forecasting philosophy. Section 3 presents the defect detection methodology that incorporates logics for\noutlier detection, change-point identification, and damage assessment. In Section 4, two case studies making use of timeseries strain data acquired by fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors affixed on the bogies of an in-service high-speed train are offered to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the proposed methodology. Finally, conclusions are drawn in2. Bayesian DLM and forecastingThe Bayesian DLM is a kind of process-based Bayesian prediction model which provides a flexible way to intuitively capture how processes evolve over time. It consists of two basic equations: an observation (measurement) equation and a system (evolution) equation . The observation (measurement) equation describes the relationship between the observed\nrandom vectors with mean zero and unknown covariance matrices V t and W t. The DLM defined above amounts to treating ht\nrange level at time t, and at represents the stress range change between time t 1 and t. v t is the zero-mean Gaussian random variable representing the error of measurement at moment t. x1t and x2t are both zero-mean Gaussian random variables representing the evolution of DLM from time t 1 to t. In association with the form of DLM in Equation (1), we haveThe Bayesian forecasting philosophy is based on the description of an observed process using its probability density function (PDF). As implied by the name, the Bayesian forecasting approach commences from Bayes’ theorem, hence enabling the calculation of conditional probabilities. The details of using DLM for the recursive one-step ahead forecasting of the (posterior) distribution of monitoring-derived stress ranges under the Bayesian framework are presented as follows\nNote that in Step 4, Atþ1 is the adaptive coefficient which can be viewed as the information tuner. It scales the correction term according to the relative variances of the prior and likelihood, as measured by Rtþ1=Q tþ1 and regressor value Ftþ1. etþ1 is\nthe one-step forward forecast error, the difference between the observed value ytþ1 and its expectation f tþ1. More details\nabout the recursive one-step ahead forecast method can be found in .3. Defect detection methodologyThe proposed defect detection methodology contains three logical processes: outlier detection, change-point detection,\nand damage assessment. By comparing the real-time measurement with the predicted values, the named outlier detection and change-point detection are devised to determine whether the measurement is a single outlier or the first observation of a remarkable change, the former being executed by calculating the Bayes factor, while the latter being based on the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once a change-point is affirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for further damagePotential outlier detection is the first step in the process of the proposed defect detection approach, accomplished by the Bayes factor calculation. Bayes factor is advocated because of its straightforward and natural interpretation of evidence afforded by data. At every time step t, the Bayesian DLM can yield a PDF for the next measurement, labeled as M0. Meanwhile, an artificial alternative model labeled as M1 is defined by shifting the mean of M0 by +h. The underlying idea of outlier\ndetection is to check the current observation against both M0 and M1. For each time step t, the Bayes factor is the ratio of thewhere yt is the measurement at time t and Dt1 refers to the history information up to time t 1. In the case of Gaussianwhere h is the shift value; yt is the observation value; f t and rt are the mean and standard deviation of the forecasting distribution for observation at time t. A Bayes factor H ¼ 1 indicates that the probability of the observation derived from model M1 is identical to the probability of that derived from Model M0. For better quantitative comparison between any two models, Jeffreys suggested interpreting the Bayes factor as a scale of evidence and provided descriptive statements although\nthe partitions are somewhat arbitrary. According to his suggestion, a Bayes factor can be divided into several intervals for assessing the significance of discrimination: 1 < H < 3 is ‘barely worth mentioning’, 3 < H < 10 is ‘substantial’,\n10 < H < 30 is ‘strong’, 30 < H < 100 is ‘very strong’, and H > 100 is ‘decisive’. In this study, Hmin ¼ 10 is set as a threshold\nAfter the confirmation of Hmin and h, an uncertainty limit (ucl) can be procured by the following equationFor instance, when the confidence level a and threshold of Bayes factor Hmin are set as 90% and 10 respectively, the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt. Thus, an observation is diagnosed as an outlier if its deviation from the mean value of M0 is larger\nWith the Bayes factor defined in Equation (9), only outliers with a positive deviation can be detected. To enable the outliers with negative deviation to be detected as well, a second Bayes factor is defined asIn the automatic monitoring process, both the Bayes factors H1;t and H2;t should be examined in parallel to enable thebehavior, rather than judgments based on long past performances. Change-point is an abrupt variation in time series data,\nrepresenting a transition that occurs between states. Change-point detection aims to detect abrupt change in the generative\nprocess of sequential data. It is assumed that a sequence of observations y1; ; yT could be divided into several nonoverlapping partitions, e.g. dataset j 1, dataset j, and dataset j + 1 as shown in Fig. 2. The delineations between partitions\nare known as change-points (e.g. TOC j 1 and TOC j); the goal of change-point detection is the determination of where the\nboundary of two adjacent partitions is located in a sequence of observations. Change-point detection approaches can be classified into offline and online methods. The former needs to observe the whole sequential observations before aiming to make\ninference on the generative process of the sequence [37–40], wheras the latter aims to update the inference at each time step\nwith the newly acquired measurements from the sequence [41–43]. In particular, the Bayesian online change-point detection methods are based on computing the probability distribution of the run length.differentiate between the single-point outlier and the beginning of a continual change. To overcome this problem, cumulative Bayes factor (local Bayes factors) is recommended to detect change-point(s) in the sequence of observations, by definingwhere lmax is the maximum number of Bayes factors taken into account. Unlike Bayes factor with implicitly no historical influence in the judgement, the consecutive Bayes factors collect evidence of change over a series of observation (from time\net al. . Akin to the Bayes factor threshold for outlier detection, the threshold of maximal cumulative Bayes factors is set as Lmin ¼ 10. If the conditions Lt > Lmin and lt > lmin occur simultaneously, an alarm of change is immediately issued at time t\n(time of notification, TON). The real time of occurrence (TOC) is (t lt þ 1), that is, TOC =t lt þ 1.Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is performed to assess damage extent and quantify the\nassociated uncertainty. The proposed approach directly quantifies the likelihoods of two scenarios (e.g., the sequential observations before and after the change-point), that is, ‘‘no fault” and ‘‘fault”, and the yielded results are easy to interpret. An\nadditional merit of the proposed approach is its ability to quantify the uncertainty in damage detection. Assume that the observed sequential data can be divided into two non-overlapping partitions, the first of which is regarded as healthy\nof the observations. Thus, the damage detection problem becomes the test of H0 : l ¼ l0 versus H1 : l–l0 with\nWith the above, damage detection can be achieved by means of Bayes factor which is defined as the ratio of the probability of observations given the alternate hypothesis to the probability of observations given the null hypothesiswhere D ¼ yf 1; ; yng refers to the observed data. It is proven to bewhere refers to the mean of the observed data fy1; ; yng. If no prior information is available, the initial mean and variance can be set as q ¼ l0 and s ¼ r 0 [][. The two assumptions take the prior mean and variance in the alternative hypothesis as]where z ¼ pfn **f** i ffi l0 0 [ At each time step (i.e.,][ n][=1), the Bayes factor][ B][ is larger for the larger values of][ z][j j][, which is reasonable]and easy to interpret. The logarithm of the Bayes factor, for convenience of comparison among a larger of values, is derived asIf the Bayes factor B10 is larger than 1, the implication is that the observed data provide evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis H1 (i.e., the structure is damaged). Otherwise, the observed data are judged to support the null hypothesis H0 (i.e.,\nthe structure is healthy). As with the previous threshold, B10 10 is set as a threshold for damage indication.\nIntegrating together the outlier detection, change-point detection and damage assessment, the implementation procedures of the proposed methodology are shown in Fig. 3. Beginning at time t, the single Bayes factor is firstly evaluated to\njudge whether yt is an outlier. If not, the maximum cumulative Bayes factor Lt and run length lt for change-point detection are calculated. Once a change-point is detected, the intervention is carried out by resetting the time to the time of occurrence\n(i.e., TOC = t lt þ 1) and by adjusting the mean value of M0 to the observation yt (i.e., f t ¼ yt), and the subsequent analysis\nwill then be started at TOC. Meanwhile, Bayesian hypothesis testing is executed for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification from the current TOC to the next TOC.4. Application to in-service monitoring data of high-speed trainAn onboard monitoring system has been designed and implemented on an in-service high-speed passenger train running on the Lanzhou-Urumqi High-Speed Railway (LUHSR) in China . As shown in Fig. 4, the monitoring system is composed\nof a total of 52 FBG strain sensors, 4 FBG temperature sensors, 11 accelerometers (tri-axial) and 1 noise sensor deployed on both motor and trailer bogies. Also, one tri-axial FBG accelerometer, one video camera and two GPS sensors are installed inside a train carriage. As the present work is focused on the real-time detection of potentially defective wheels by using strain monitoring data from bogies, only the deployment of strain sensors is concerned. The strain sensors are mounted\non 4 measurement zones of the bogies: (i) the zone with the action of high loads; (ii) the stress transmission zone; (iii)\nthe zone with high responses predicted by finite element analysis; and (iv) welded joints. FBG strain (and temperature) sensors are deployed and attached to the surface of the train bogie with industrial glue and tapes, and connected to the interrogator (data logger) with laptop inside the train carriage through optical fiber cables.\nThe data utilized in this study were obtained from a monitoring schedule spanning 18 days as shown in Table 1. The total length of the LUHSR between Lanzhou and Urumqi is 1777 km. In the trip from Lanzhou to Urumqi, the high-speed train\nstops by 14 stations and travels cross 13 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 13th); in trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou, the high-speed train stops by 15 stations and travels cross 14 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 14th). During the monitoring\nperiod, the train operated at its normal speed around 200–250 km/h. The sampling rate for all the sensors was set at 5000\nSince the train wheels were lathed (lathing is a process to make wheels perfectly rounded) during the monitoring period,\nthe recorded data contain information in line with two different states (before lathing and after lathing). The wheels can be considered as potentially unhealthy (defective) before lathing and as healthy after lathing. To verify the effectiveness of theproposed real-time defect detection methodology, the strain monitoring data obtained from the bogies before and afterThe train’s dynamic responses may be influenced by different subgrade conditions of the railroad, such as ground, tunnel,\nand bridge. To eliminate the effects of different railroad conditions, the strain data recorded from the same railroad sectionbefore and after lathing, are used in each scenario. In addition, the passenger loads in different trips are deemed statistically identical and the speed of train is assumed to be constant as in normal operation. Without loss of generality, the monitoring\ndata respectively obtained from two typical railroad sections (1st and 14th) in the trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou are chosen to illustrate the proposed real-time defect detection methodology, which are from the strain gauge (MS3-7) deployed at the For the sake of brevity, the monitoring data collected from the 1st railroad section are denoted as Case 1, while those from the 14th railroad section are denoted as Case 2. Firstly, the measured strain is converted to stress for the subsequent stress\nrange calculation. For the strain gauges mounted on the steel surface, the conversion of the measured strain to stress is made by rs ¼ Ee, where E is the elasticity modulus of steel and e is the strain after eliminating the effect of varying temperatures.where em is the measured strain, T m is the measured temperature in the vicinity of the strain sensor, T 0 is the temperature at\nthe installation, and a1 is a constant coefficient. In our case, the original temperature is 4, i.e., T 0 ¼ 4. The results of temperature compensation are demonstrated in Fig. 5. It is obvious that the trend in strain responses caused by temperature\nAfterwards, the stress ranges are extracted from the monitoring-derived stress data by the application of the rainflow\ncounting algorithm. From each stress cycle, the stress range Sa is obtained by calculating the difference between the maximum stress rmax and the minimum stress rmin measured in that stress cycle, i.e., Sa ¼ rmax rmin. More details on the stress ranges extraction are given in . The stress ranges with amplitudes lower than 1 MPa need to be culled because the majority are caused by noise. To decrease the uncertainty arising from the measurement facilities, the average stress ranges for\nevery ten minutes are used as the target quantities. Due to the different lengths of the two selected railroad sections (1st and 14th), the traveling time of the train in each section is also different. This results in different data lengths. The data\nlengths of the average stress ranges in Case 1 and Case 2 are 110 and 90, respectively. Figs. and 7 show the original measured strain responses before and after lathing in Case 1 and Case 2, respectively.Following the implementation procedures mentioned before, the defect detection results for Case 1 are demonstrated in\nFigs. and 9. Fig. 8(a) shows the average stress range (red point) together with 1-step ahead prediction (blue solid line) and\nthe corresponding 90% prediction interval (grey shadow). It is observed that, although some observations at the time interval t 2 fall outside the 90% prediction interval, only the Bayes factor at time t ¼ 55 exceeds the established threshold of Hmin ¼ 10 as shown in Fig. 9(a). It is thus judged as an outlier (marked as h). The reason is that because when applying the proposed approach, the shift parameter is set as h ¼ 1:645rt, resulting in the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt while the other\nfour observations are still within the uncertainty limit. On the other hand, Fig. 9(b)–(c) shows the results of the maximum cumulative Bayes factor and the corresponding run length for change detection. It is seen that the maximum cumulative\nBayes factor values at time instants t ¼ 56; 57 and 58 are larger than the threshold of Lmin ¼ 10, while merely the run length at instant t ¼ 58 surpasses the threshold of lmin ¼ 4. Apparently, this observation at time t ¼ 58 fulfills the conditions of change-point detection causing an alarm to be issued (i.e., TON ¼ 58). The identified real occurrence time of change-point is t ¼ 55 (i.e., TOC ¼ 58 4 þ 1 ¼ 55), which coincides well with the actual time point of lathing the wheels. In accordance\nwith the real-time identification of change-point occurrence, the prediction model is refined by altering the guessed mean\nvalue at TOC, as shown in Fig. 8(b). The predictions near TOC in the refined model obviously agree well with the actual observations, thus offering a better prediction performance than that of the original model.\nThe results of defect detection by means of Bayesian hypothesis testing are illustrated in Fig. 9(d). The discrimination between ‘‘healthy” and ‘‘defective” is quantified by the logarithm value of Bayes factor. It is seen from Fig. 9(d) that the vast\nmajority of logarithm values of Bayes factor before TOC are nearly zero and below the threshold level (dotted red line), which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘healthy state” (no defect). This is consistent with the actual health condition and thus validatesthe capability of the Bayesian hypothesis testing. On the contrary, all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than 2, meaning that the corresponding Bayes factor values exceed 100. According to the classification of Bayes factor stipulated in Sub-section 3.1, this result (H > 100) favors the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity is classified as ‘‘decisive”. Indeed, wheels immediately before being sent to depot for lathing were in the state of ‘heavily defective’.\nMaking use of Eq. (21), the probabilities of damage after TOC are obtained as 100%, that is, the wheels are identified as defective with a very high confidence.\nThe defect detection results for Case 2 are similar to Case 1, and are illustrated in Figs. and 11. As seen in Fig. 11(a)–(c)\nno outlier exists throughout the whole period, but a change-point is identified, of which the time of notification is t ¼ 44 (i.e.,\nTON ¼ 44) and the real time of occurrence is t ¼ 41 (i.e., TOC ¼ 44 4 þ 1 ¼ 41). The result matches well with the actual time point when wheel lathing is inflicted. For the predictions near the change-point, the modified prediction model\n(Fig. 10(b)) offers a better performance than the original model (Fig. 10(a)). As illustrated in Fig. 11(d), all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than the threshold (dotted red line), whereas the values before TOC are within thethreshold line. The values of Bayes factor after TOC are obtained to be higher than 100 (H > 100) and the corresponding probabilities of damage are approximately 100%, which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity\nApart from the accuracy of the proposed approach, the computational efficiency is also of concern. The algorithmic implementation is performed on a Lenovo ThinkCentre M720t desktop (Lenovo, Beijing, China) with Dual Intel Core i7-8700 processor (Intel, California, USA) and 24 GB of memory. The computation times consumed in Case 1 and Case 2 are 4.0109 s and\n3.7704 s respectively. In this sense, it realizes the detection of wheel defects in real time.5. ConclusionsA novel methodology for real-time defect detection of high-speed train wheels using Bayesian forecasting and dynamic linear model (DLM) has been developed and validated in this study. First, the DLM is formulated to approximate the actual\nframework. Afterwards, three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) are elicited for outlier detection and change-point detection. After the change-point has been confirmed, damage assessment is executed by the Bayesian hypothesis testing of the sequential observations before and after the change-point. Due to accommodating the dynamic evolution process and the statistical nature of the method, the proposed approach not only possesses the ability of real-time damage detection, but also enables damage quantification (through classifying the range of Bayes factor) and uncertainty assessment (through calculating the probability of damage). The methodology is illustrated by using the onlinelathing). In the two cases addressed, wheel defects are successfully identified, hence validating the effectiveness of the developed method. The quantitative results about the damage extent and confidence would provide useful information helping to\nmake cost-effective, risk-based decisions with the aim of maintaining the operation safety of high-speed rail.\nDespite the proposed methodology being developed for wheel defect detection of high-speed trains, it can also be applied to low-speed passenger and freight trains as well as extended to SHM for a wide variety of civil infrastructure (e.g., bridges,\nbuildings and tunnels) when vibration signals are available via monitoring. In this study, the second-order polynomial DLM\nis employed to model the stress ranges, which only considers the change of stress range level and trend. However, most longterm SHM data, especially long-term strain monitoring data, are generally contaminated by trend, seasonal (cyclical) and\nregression effects, which require a more complex model. The Bayesian DLM enables the modeling of time-dependent responses of a structure by integrating appropriate components, for instance, the response with cyclical characteristics\ncan be depicted by embedding a seasonal (cyclical) component. Thus, in accordance with the nature of monitoring data,\nan appropriate Bayesian DLM enabling to describe time series data of different features, can be formulated for damage detection of a variety of structures subject to different operational/environmental conditions.Administrative Region, China (Project No. PolyU 152024/17E).

IntroductionHigh-speed rail (HSR) is being developed in Asian and European countries to satisfy the rapidly growing demand for intercity services and to shore up economic growth. The rapid\ngrowth of HSR, however, has posed great challenges regarding operation safety, reliability\nand ride comfort. Irregular wheel defects can induce high-magnitude impact forces hindering safety and ride comfort of HSR and may also cause damage to rail tracks and vehicles.real time. The proposed methodology embraces logics for (i) prognosis, (ii) potential outlier\ndetection, (iii) identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and (iv) quantification of damage extent and uncertainty. Relying on the strain monitoring data acquired from high-speed train bogies, the Bayesian DLM for characterizing the actual stress ranges is established, by which one-step forecast distribution is elicited before proceeding to the\nnext observation. The detection of change-point is executed by comparing the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM) and an alternative model\n(the mean value is shifted by a prescribed offset) to determine which better fits the actual observation. If the comparison results are in favor of the alternative model, it is claimed that a potential change has occurred. Whether such an observation is an outlier or the beginning of a genuine change (change-point), three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum\ncumulative Bayes factor and run length) are performed for further identification.

Rail accidents were occasionally caused by failures such as severe defects or fatigue of railway components. To maintain a good service quality and operation safety, it is paramount to develop\nonline monitoring techniques that not only quickly recognize faults of mission-critical HSR components but also can anticipate of long-term mechanisms and gradual deterioration in performance.\nWheelsets in a high-speed train are physically connected with and controlled by the bogie system which corrects alignment for stable running and reduces the vibration caused by wheel-rail interaction . However, the wheel performance\nprogressively deteriorates in different mechanisms (e.g., wheel flat and wheel polygonization) during the routine operation of a high-speed train . Wheel performance deterioration increases stresses experienced by the bogie system. In addition,\nthe increased stress within bogie frames caused by wheel quality deterioration can be unexpectedly large, thus posing a serious threat to the operation safety of concerned trains. According to the statistics of train accidents caused by failure in\nmechanical components during 2004 to 2007 in the United States, the wheelsets faults are the most cause with a rate of\n44.7% . Therefore, the railway managers are keen to keep wheels in an adequate condition and detect potential failure\nas soon as possible. For railway wheels, there are three different ways of estimating the conditions: physical modeling, statistical modeling and condition monitoring . However, the first two ways are not applicable to in-service\nwheel condition assessment, and in contrast, the third way is most feasible for wheel condition estimation. The monitoring approaches available to wheel defect detection can be divided into in-workshop inspection and in-service detection . The\nlatter provides the real-time data required for maintenance planning, while the former is normally carried out at workshops at fixed intervals. The commonly used in-workshop methods for wheel defect inspection include the ultrasonic techniques, infrared camera and magnetic methods . In-service monitoring approaches can be categorized as on-board and wayside methods. The on-board methods implement sensors on the train and continuously obtain comprehensive data from\nthe system. The methods of this category include magnetic technique , ultrasonic technique , acoustic technique, and vibration technique . On the other hand, wayside methods attempt to detect the wheel or vehicle performance\nby installing sensors on the rail or its surrounding areas. Such indirect measurements give rise to limited information of the wheel condition while they can monitor all train wheels going by with using only one or a few sensors. According to the type\nof sensors used, wayside detection approaches include strain sensing technology , fiber optic sensing technology ,\nultrasonic technique , vibration technique , acoustic emission , lasers and high-speed cameras . However,\nthe study on data interpretation techniques enabling the extraction of defect-sensitive features is far from sufficient.\nBayesian dynamic linear model (DLM) is an elegant system approach to handling time series data from a Bayesian perspective, which originates from the field of applied statistics and is extensively used in other fields such as economics\nand engineering [25–30]. The Bayesian DLM treats the time series as the output of a dynamic system perturbed by random disturbances. It is suitable for modeling both univariate and multivariate time series, and also for representing the structural changes, non-stationarity and irregular patterns . Unlike the classical time series method which assumes a fixed relationship between the dependent variables (response variables) and the independent variables (regressors), the DLM considers\nthe relationship changes over time and is able to directly capture time series data features, such as trend, seasonality,\nand regression effects. Moreover, the DLM allows for descriptions of temporary or permanent shifts in time series parameters that occur abruptly, which are necessary for outlier and damage detection in structural health monitoring (SHM) paradigms. Recently, Goulet and his collaborator adopted the Bayesian DLM theory in SHM to model the time-dependent\nresponses of structures by breaking them into subcomponents. In the perspective of real-time damage detection, only few studies are available. The first attempt was conducted by Lipowsky et al. with the development of a Bayesian DLM-based\nreal-time detection algorithm to evaluate the performance of a gas turbine using simulated data. Later on, Wang et al.\nand Zhang et al. adopted the above algorithm for detecting high-speed train defects by using real-world monitoring\ndata. In the previous studies, however, the real-time detection algorithm devised possesses only outlier identification and\nchange detection abilities, without the function of damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.context of Bayesian DLM, which incorporates logics for prognosis, potential outlier detection, identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and damage extent and uncertainty quantification. The Bayesian DLM is considered as a tool\nfor time series analysis, while Bayesian forecasting is executed to enable the calculation of one-step ahead forecast distribution. The change-point detection is performed by checking the current observation against the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM for current instant) as well as against an alternative model of which the mean value\nis shifted by a prescribed offset. The detection rule is that if the alternative model better fits the actual observation, a potential change is signaled. To further determine whether such an observation is only an outlier or the beginning of an actual\nchange (change-point), a specific logic is developed by introducing the Bayes factor and the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.\nThe main contributions of this study are the provision of: (i) a formula which not only enables the modeling of actual framework; (ii) three metrics (i.e., the Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) to allow for outlier\nand change-point detection in real-time manner; and (iii) an efficient way for damage extent assessment and uncertainty\nquantification. The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the Bayesian DLM theory and an elaboration of the Bayesian forecasting philosophy. Section 3 presents the defect detection methodology that incorporates logics for\noutlier detection, change-point identification, and damage assessment. In Section 4, two case studies making use of timeseries strain data acquired by fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors affixed on the bogies of an in-service high-speed train are offered to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the proposed methodology. Finally, conclusions are drawn in2. Bayesian DLM and forecastingThe Bayesian DLM is a kind of process-based Bayesian prediction model which provides a flexible way to intuitively capture how processes evolve over time. It consists of two basic equations: an observation (measurement) equation and a system (evolution) equation . The observation (measurement) equation describes the relationship between the observed\nrandom vectors with mean zero and unknown covariance matrices V t and W t. The DLM defined above amounts to treating ht\nrange level at time t, and at represents the stress range change between time t 1 and t. v t is the zero-mean Gaussian random variable representing the error of measurement at moment t. x1t and x2t are both zero-mean Gaussian random variables representing the evolution of DLM from time t 1 to t. In association with the form of DLM in Equation (1), we haveThe Bayesian forecasting philosophy is based on the description of an observed process using its probability density function (PDF). As implied by the name, the Bayesian forecasting approach commences from Bayes’ theorem, hence enabling the calculation of conditional probabilities. The details of using DLM for the recursive one-step ahead forecasting of the (posterior) distribution of monitoring-derived stress ranges under the Bayesian framework are presented as follows\nNote that in Step 4, Atþ1 is the adaptive coefficient which can be viewed as the information tuner. It scales the correction term according to the relative variances of the prior and likelihood, as measured by Rtþ1=Q tþ1 and regressor value Ftþ1. etþ1 is\nthe one-step forward forecast error, the difference between the observed value ytþ1 and its expectation f tþ1. More details\nabout the recursive one-step ahead forecast method can be found in .3. Defect detection methodologyThe proposed defect detection methodology contains three logical processes: outlier detection, change-point detection,\nand damage assessment. By comparing the real-time measurement with the predicted values, the named outlier detection and change-point detection are devised to determine whether the measurement is a single outlier or the first observation of a remarkable change, the former being executed by calculating the Bayes factor, while the latter being based on the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once a change-point is affirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for further damagePotential outlier detection is the first step in the process of the proposed defect detection approach, accomplished by the Bayes factor calculation. Bayes factor is advocated because of its straightforward and natural interpretation of evidence afforded by data. At every time step t, the Bayesian DLM can yield a PDF for the next measurement, labeled as M0. Meanwhile, an artificial alternative model labeled as M1 is defined by shifting the mean of M0 by +h. The underlying idea of outlier\ndetection is to check the current observation against both M0 and M1. For each time step t, the Bayes factor is the ratio of thewhere yt is the measurement at time t and Dt1 refers to the history information up to time t 1. In the case of Gaussianwhere h is the shift value; yt is the observation value; f t and rt are the mean and standard deviation of the forecasting distribution for observation at time t. A Bayes factor H ¼ 1 indicates that the probability of the observation derived from model M1 is identical to the probability of that derived from Model M0. For better quantitative comparison between any two models, Jeffreys suggested interpreting the Bayes factor as a scale of evidence and provided descriptive statements although\nthe partitions are somewhat arbitrary. According to his suggestion, a Bayes factor can be divided into several intervals for assessing the significance of discrimination: 1 < H < 3 is ‘barely worth mentioning’, 3 < H < 10 is ‘substantial’,\n10 < H < 30 is ‘strong’, 30 < H < 100 is ‘very strong’, and H > 100 is ‘decisive’. In this study, Hmin ¼ 10 is set as a threshold\nAfter the confirmation of Hmin and h, an uncertainty limit (ucl) can be procured by the following equationFor instance, when the confidence level a and threshold of Bayes factor Hmin are set as 90% and 10 respectively, the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt. Thus, an observation is diagnosed as an outlier if its deviation from the mean value of M0 is larger\nWith the Bayes factor defined in Equation (9), only outliers with a positive deviation can be detected. To enable the outliers with negative deviation to be detected as well, a second Bayes factor is defined asIn the automatic monitoring process, both the Bayes factors H1;t and H2;t should be examined in parallel to enable thebehavior, rather than judgments based on long past performances. Change-point is an abrupt variation in time series data,\nrepresenting a transition that occurs between states. Change-point detection aims to detect abrupt change in the generative\nprocess of sequential data. It is assumed that a sequence of observations y1; ; yT could be divided into several nonoverlapping partitions, e.g. dataset j 1, dataset j, and dataset j + 1 as shown in Fig. 2. The delineations between partitions\nare known as change-points (e.g. TOC j 1 and TOC j); the goal of change-point detection is the determination of where the\nboundary of two adjacent partitions is located in a sequence of observations. Change-point detection approaches can be classified into offline and online methods. The former needs to observe the whole sequential observations before aiming to make\ninference on the generative process of the sequence [37–40], wheras the latter aims to update the inference at each time step\nwith the newly acquired measurements from the sequence [41–43]. In particular, the Bayesian online change-point detection methods are based on computing the probability distribution of the run length.differentiate between the single-point outlier and the beginning of a continual change. To overcome this problem, cumulative Bayes factor (local Bayes factors) is recommended to detect change-point(s) in the sequence of observations, by definingwhere lmax is the maximum number of Bayes factors taken into account. Unlike Bayes factor with implicitly no historical influence in the judgement, the consecutive Bayes factors collect evidence of change over a series of observation (from time\net al. . Akin to the Bayes factor threshold for outlier detection, the threshold of maximal cumulative Bayes factors is set as Lmin ¼ 10. If the conditions Lt > Lmin and lt > lmin occur simultaneously, an alarm of change is immediately issued at time t\n(time of notification, TON). The real time of occurrence (TOC) is (t lt þ 1), that is, TOC =t lt þ 1.Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is performed to assess damage extent and quantify the\nassociated uncertainty. The proposed approach directly quantifies the likelihoods of two scenarios (e.g., the sequential observations before and after the change-point), that is, ‘‘no fault” and ‘‘fault”, and the yielded results are easy to interpret. An\nadditional merit of the proposed approach is its ability to quantify the uncertainty in damage detection. Assume that the observed sequential data can be divided into two non-overlapping partitions, the first of which is regarded as healthy\nof the observations. Thus, the damage detection problem becomes the test of H0 : l ¼ l0 versus H1 : l–l0 with\nWith the above, damage detection can be achieved by means of Bayes factor which is defined as the ratio of the probability of observations given the alternate hypothesis to the probability of observations given the null hypothesiswhere D ¼ yf 1; ; yng refers to the observed data. It is proven to bewhere refers to the mean of the observed data fy1; ; yng. If no prior information is available, the initial mean and variance can be set as q ¼ l0 and s ¼ r 0 [][. The two assumptions take the prior mean and variance in the alternative hypothesis as]where z ¼ pfn **f** i ffi l0 0 [ At each time step (i.e.,][ n][=1), the Bayes factor][ B][ is larger for the larger values of][ z][j j][, which is reasonable]and easy to interpret. The logarithm of the Bayes factor, for convenience of comparison among a larger of values, is derived asIf the Bayes factor B10 is larger than 1, the implication is that the observed data provide evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis H1 (i.e., the structure is damaged). Otherwise, the observed data are judged to support the null hypothesis H0 (i.e.,\nthe structure is healthy). As with the previous threshold, B10 10 is set as a threshold for damage indication.\nIntegrating together the outlier detection, change-point detection and damage assessment, the implementation procedures of the proposed methodology are shown in Fig. 3. Beginning at time t, the single Bayes factor is firstly evaluated to\njudge whether yt is an outlier. If not, the maximum cumulative Bayes factor Lt and run length lt for change-point detection are calculated. Once a change-point is detected, the intervention is carried out by resetting the time to the time of occurrence\n(i.e., TOC = t lt þ 1) and by adjusting the mean value of M0 to the observation yt (i.e., f t ¼ yt), and the subsequent analysis\nwill then be started at TOC. Meanwhile, Bayesian hypothesis testing is executed for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification from the current TOC to the next TOC.4. Application to in-service monitoring data of high-speed trainAn onboard monitoring system has been designed and implemented on an in-service high-speed passenger train running on the Lanzhou-Urumqi High-Speed Railway (LUHSR) in China . As shown in Fig. 4, the monitoring system is composed\nof a total of 52 FBG strain sensors, 4 FBG temperature sensors, 11 accelerometers (tri-axial) and 1 noise sensor deployed on both motor and trailer bogies. Also, one tri-axial FBG accelerometer, one video camera and two GPS sensors are installed inside a train carriage. As the present work is focused on the real-time detection of potentially defective wheels by using strain monitoring data from bogies, only the deployment of strain sensors is concerned. The strain sensors are mounted\non 4 measurement zones of the bogies: (i) the zone with the action of high loads; (ii) the stress transmission zone; (iii)\nthe zone with high responses predicted by finite element analysis; and (iv) welded joints. FBG strain (and temperature) sensors are deployed and attached to the surface of the train bogie with industrial glue and tapes, and connected to the interrogator (data logger) with laptop inside the train carriage through optical fiber cables.\nThe data utilized in this study were obtained from a monitoring schedule spanning 18 days as shown in Table 1. The total length of the LUHSR between Lanzhou and Urumqi is 1777 km. In the trip from Lanzhou to Urumqi, the high-speed train\nstops by 14 stations and travels cross 13 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 13th); in trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou, the high-speed train stops by 15 stations and travels cross 14 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 14th). During the monitoring\nperiod, the train operated at its normal speed around 200–250 km/h. The sampling rate for all the sensors was set at 5000\nSince the train wheels were lathed (lathing is a process to make wheels perfectly rounded) during the monitoring period,\nthe recorded data contain information in line with two different states (before lathing and after lathing). The wheels can be considered as potentially unhealthy (defective) before lathing and as healthy after lathing. To verify the effectiveness of theproposed real-time defect detection methodology, the strain monitoring data obtained from the bogies before and afterThe train’s dynamic responses may be influenced by different subgrade conditions of the railroad, such as ground, tunnel,\nand bridge. To eliminate the effects of different railroad conditions, the strain data recorded from the same railroad sectionbefore and after lathing, are used in each scenario. In addition, the passenger loads in different trips are deemed statistically identical and the speed of train is assumed to be constant as in normal operation. Without loss of generality, the monitoring\ndata respectively obtained from two typical railroad sections (1st and 14th) in the trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou are chosen to illustrate the proposed real-time defect detection methodology, which are from the strain gauge (MS3-7) deployed at the For the sake of brevity, the monitoring data collected from the 1st railroad section are denoted as Case 1, while those from the 14th railroad section are denoted as Case 2. Firstly, the measured strain is converted to stress for the subsequent stress\nrange calculation. For the strain gauges mounted on the steel surface, the conversion of the measured strain to stress is made by rs ¼ Ee, where E is the elasticity modulus of steel and e is the strain after eliminating the effect of varying temperatures.where em is the measured strain, T m is the measured temperature in the vicinity of the strain sensor, T 0 is the temperature at\nthe installation, and a1 is a constant coefficient. In our case, the original temperature is 4, i.e., T 0 ¼ 4. The results of temperature compensation are demonstrated in Fig. 5. It is obvious that the trend in strain responses caused by temperature\nAfterwards, the stress ranges are extracted from the monitoring-derived stress data by the application of the rainflow\ncounting algorithm. From each stress cycle, the stress range Sa is obtained by calculating the difference between the maximum stress rmax and the minimum stress rmin measured in that stress cycle, i.e., Sa ¼ rmax rmin. More details on the stress ranges extraction are given in . The stress ranges with amplitudes lower than 1 MPa need to be culled because the majority are caused by noise. To decrease the uncertainty arising from the measurement facilities, the average stress ranges for\nevery ten minutes are used as the target quantities. Due to the different lengths of the two selected railroad sections (1st and 14th), the traveling time of the train in each section is also different. This results in different data lengths. The data\nlengths of the average stress ranges in Case 1 and Case 2 are 110 and 90, respectively. Figs. and 7 show the original measured strain responses before and after lathing in Case 1 and Case 2, respectively.Following the implementation procedures mentioned before, the defect detection results for Case 1 are demonstrated in\nFigs. and 9. Fig. 8(a) shows the average stress range (red point) together with 1-step ahead prediction (blue solid line) and\nthe corresponding 90% prediction interval (grey shadow). It is observed that, although some observations at the time interval t 2 fall outside the 90% prediction interval, only the Bayes factor at time t ¼ 55 exceeds the established threshold of Hmin ¼ 10 as shown in Fig. 9(a). It is thus judged as an outlier (marked as h). The reason is that because when applying the proposed approach, the shift parameter is set as h ¼ 1:645rt, resulting in the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt while the other\nfour observations are still within the uncertainty limit. On the other hand, Fig. 9(b)–(c) shows the results of the maximum cumulative Bayes factor and the corresponding run length for change detection. It is seen that the maximum cumulative\nBayes factor values at time instants t ¼ 56; 57 and 58 are larger than the threshold of Lmin ¼ 10, while merely the run length at instant t ¼ 58 surpasses the threshold of lmin ¼ 4. Apparently, this observation at time t ¼ 58 fulfills the conditions of change-point detection causing an alarm to be issued (i.e., TON ¼ 58). The identified real occurrence time of change-point is t ¼ 55 (i.e., TOC ¼ 58 4 þ 1 ¼ 55), which coincides well with the actual time point of lathing the wheels. In accordance\nwith the real-time identification of change-point occurrence, the prediction model is refined by altering the guessed mean\nvalue at TOC, as shown in Fig. 8(b). The predictions near TOC in the refined model obviously agree well with the actual observations, thus offering a better prediction performance than that of the original model.\nThe results of defect detection by means of Bayesian hypothesis testing are illustrated in Fig. 9(d). The discrimination between ‘‘healthy” and ‘‘defective” is quantified by the logarithm value of Bayes factor. It is seen from Fig. 9(d) that the vast\nmajority of logarithm values of Bayes factor before TOC are nearly zero and below the threshold level (dotted red line), which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘healthy state” (no defect). This is consistent with the actual health condition and thus validatesthe capability of the Bayesian hypothesis testing. On the contrary, all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than 2, meaning that the corresponding Bayes factor values exceed 100. According to the classification of Bayes factor stipulated in Sub-section 3.1, this result (H > 100) favors the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity is classified as ‘‘decisive”. Indeed, wheels immediately before being sent to depot for lathing were in the state of ‘heavily defective’.\nMaking use of Eq. (21), the probabilities of damage after TOC are obtained as 100%, that is, the wheels are identified as defective with a very high confidence.\nThe defect detection results for Case 2 are similar to Case 1, and are illustrated in Figs. and 11. As seen in Fig. 11(a)–(c)\nno outlier exists throughout the whole period, but a change-point is identified, of which the time of notification is t ¼ 44 (i.e.,\nTON ¼ 44) and the real time of occurrence is t ¼ 41 (i.e., TOC ¼ 44 4 þ 1 ¼ 41). The result matches well with the actual time point when wheel lathing is inflicted. For the predictions near the change-point, the modified prediction model\n(Fig. 10(b)) offers a better performance than the original model (Fig. 10(a)). As illustrated in Fig. 11(d), all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than the threshold (dotted red line), whereas the values before TOC are within thethreshold line. The values of Bayes factor after TOC are obtained to be higher than 100 (H > 100) and the corresponding probabilities of damage are approximately 100%, which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity\nApart from the accuracy of the proposed approach, the computational efficiency is also of concern. The algorithmic implementation is performed on a Lenovo ThinkCentre M720t desktop (Lenovo, Beijing, China) with Dual Intel Core i7-8700 processor (Intel, California, USA) and 24 GB of memory. The computation times consumed in Case 1 and Case 2 are 4.0109 s and\n3.7704 s respectively. In this sense, it realizes the detection of wheel defects in real time.5. ConclusionsA novel methodology for real-time defect detection of high-speed train wheels using Bayesian forecasting and dynamic linear model (DLM) has been developed and validated in this study. First, the DLM is formulated to approximate the actual\nframework. Afterwards, three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) are elicited for outlier detection and change-point detection. After the change-point has been confirmed, damage assessment is executed by the Bayesian hypothesis testing of the sequential observations before and after the change-point. Due to accommodating the dynamic evolution process and the statistical nature of the method, the proposed approach not only possesses the ability of real-time damage detection, but also enables damage quantification (through classifying the range of Bayes factor) and uncertainty assessment (through calculating the probability of damage). The methodology is illustrated by using the onlinelathing). In the two cases addressed, wheel defects are successfully identified, hence validating the effectiveness of the developed method. The quantitative results about the damage extent and confidence would provide useful information helping to\nmake cost-effective, risk-based decisions with the aim of maintaining the operation safety of high-speed rail.\nDespite the proposed methodology being developed for wheel defect detection of high-speed trains, it can also be applied to low-speed passenger and freight trains as well as extended to SHM for a wide variety of civil infrastructure (e.g., bridges,\nbuildings and tunnels) when vibration signals are available via monitoring. In this study, the second-order polynomial DLM\nis employed to model the stress ranges, which only considers the change of stress range level and trend. However, most longterm SHM data, especially long-term strain monitoring data, are generally contaminated by trend, seasonal (cyclical) and\nregression effects, which require a more complex model. The Bayesian DLM enables the modeling of time-dependent responses of a structure by integrating appropriate components, for instance, the response with cyclical characteristics\ncan be depicted by embedding a seasonal (cyclical) component. Thus, in accordance with the nature of monitoring data,\nan appropriate Bayesian DLM enabling to describe time series data of different features, can be formulated for damage detection of a variety of structures subject to different operational/environmental conditions.Administrative Region, China (Project No. PolyU 152024/17E).

IntroductionHigh-speed rail (HSR) is being developed in Asian and European countries to satisfy the rapidly growing demand for intercity services and to shore up economic growth. The rapid\ngrowth of HSR, however, has posed great challenges regarding operation safety, reliability\nand ride comfort. Irregular wheel defects can induce high-magnitude impact forces hindering safety and ride comfort of HSR and may also cause damage to rail tracks and vehicles.real time. The proposed methodology embraces logics for (i) prognosis, (ii) potential outlier\ndetection, (iii) identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and (iv) quantification of damage extent and uncertainty. Relying on the strain monitoring data acquired from high-speed train bogies, the Bayesian DLM for characterizing the actual stress ranges is established, by which one-step forecast distribution is elicited before proceeding to the\nnext observation. The detection of change-point is executed by comparing the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM) and an alternative model\n(the mean value is shifted by a prescribed offset) to determine which better fits the actual observation. If the comparison results are in favor of the alternative model, it is claimed that a potential change has occurred. Whether such an observation is an outlier or the beginning of a genuine change (change-point), three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum\ncumulative Bayes factor and run length) are performed for further identification.

Rail accidents were occasionally caused by failures such as severe defects or fatigue of railway components. To maintain a good service quality and operation safety, it is paramount to develop\nonline monitoring techniques that not only quickly recognize faults of mission-critical HSR components but also can anticipate of long-term mechanisms and gradual deterioration in performance.\nWheelsets in a high-speed train are physically connected with and controlled by the bogie system which corrects alignment for stable running and reduces the vibration caused by wheel-rail interaction . However, the wheel performance\nprogressively deteriorates in different mechanisms (e.g., wheel flat and wheel polygonization) during the routine operation of a high-speed train . Wheel performance deterioration increases stresses experienced by the bogie system. In addition,\nthe increased stress within bogie frames caused by wheel quality deterioration can be unexpectedly large, thus posing a serious threat to the operation safety of concerned trains. According to the statistics of train accidents caused by failure in\nmechanical components during 2004 to 2007 in the United States, the wheelsets faults are the most cause with a rate of\n44.7% . Therefore, the railway managers are keen to keep wheels in an adequate condition and detect potential failure\nas soon as possible. For railway wheels, there are three different ways of estimating the conditions: physical modeling, statistical modeling and condition monitoring . However, the first two ways are not applicable to in-service\nwheel condition assessment, and in contrast, the third way is most feasible for wheel condition estimation. The monitoring approaches available to wheel defect detection can be divided into in-workshop inspection and in-service detection . The\nlatter provides the real-time data required for maintenance planning, while the former is normally carried out at workshops at fixed intervals. The commonly used in-workshop methods for wheel defect inspection include the ultrasonic techniques, infrared camera and magnetic methods . In-service monitoring approaches can be categorized as on-board and wayside methods. The on-board methods implement sensors on the train and continuously obtain comprehensive data from\nthe system. The methods of this category include magnetic technique , ultrasonic technique , acoustic technique, and vibration technique . On the other hand, wayside methods attempt to detect the wheel or vehicle performance\nby installing sensors on the rail or its surrounding areas. Such indirect measurements give rise to limited information of the wheel condition while they can monitor all train wheels going by with using only one or a few sensors. According to the type\nof sensors used, wayside detection approaches include strain sensing technology , fiber optic sensing technology ,\nultrasonic technique , vibration technique , acoustic emission , lasers and high-speed cameras . However,\nthe study on data interpretation techniques enabling the extraction of defect-sensitive features is far from sufficient.\nBayesian dynamic linear model (DLM) is an elegant system approach to handling time series data from a Bayesian perspective, which originates from the field of applied statistics and is extensively used in other fields such as economics\nand engineering [25–30]. The Bayesian DLM treats the time series as the output of a dynamic system perturbed by random disturbances. It is suitable for modeling both univariate and multivariate time series, and also for representing the structural changes, non-stationarity and irregular patterns . Unlike the classical time series method which assumes a fixed relationship between the dependent variables (response variables) and the independent variables (regressors), the DLM considers\nthe relationship changes over time and is able to directly capture time series data features, such as trend, seasonality,\nand regression effects. Moreover, the DLM allows for descriptions of temporary or permanent shifts in time series parameters that occur abruptly, which are necessary for outlier and damage detection in structural health monitoring (SHM) paradigms. Recently, Goulet and his collaborator adopted the Bayesian DLM theory in SHM to model the time-dependent\nresponses of structures by breaking them into subcomponents. In the perspective of real-time damage detection, only few studies are available. The first attempt was conducted by Lipowsky et al. with the development of a Bayesian DLM-based\nreal-time detection algorithm to evaluate the performance of a gas turbine using simulated data. Later on, Wang et al.\nand Zhang et al. adopted the above algorithm for detecting high-speed train defects by using real-world monitoring\ndata. In the previous studies, however, the real-time detection algorithm devised possesses only outlier identification and\nchange detection abilities, without the function of damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.context of Bayesian DLM, which incorporates logics for prognosis, potential outlier detection, identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and damage extent and uncertainty quantification. The Bayesian DLM is considered as a tool\nfor time series analysis, while Bayesian forecasting is executed to enable the calculation of one-step ahead forecast distribution. The change-point detection is performed by checking the current observation against the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM for current instant) as well as against an alternative model of which the mean value\nis shifted by a prescribed offset. The detection rule is that if the alternative model better fits the actual observation, a potential change is signaled. To further determine whether such an observation is only an outlier or the beginning of an actual\nchange (change-point), a specific logic is developed by introducing the Bayes factor and the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.\nThe main contributions of this study are the provision of: (i) a formula which not only enables the modeling of actual framework; (ii) three metrics (i.e., the Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) to allow for outlier\nand change-point detection in real-time manner; and (iii) an efficient way for damage extent assessment and uncertainty\nquantification. The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the Bayesian DLM theory and an elaboration of the Bayesian forecasting philosophy. Section 3 presents the defect detection methodology that incorporates logics for\noutlier detection, change-point identification, and damage assessment. In Section 4, two case studies making use of timeseries strain data acquired by fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors affixed on the bogies of an in-service high-speed train are offered to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the proposed methodology. Finally, conclusions are drawn in2. Bayesian DLM and forecastingThe Bayesian DLM is a kind of process-based Bayesian prediction model which provides a flexible way to intuitively capture how processes evolve over time. It consists of two basic equations: an observation (measurement) equation and a system (evolution) equation . The observation (measurement) equation describes the relationship between the observed\nrandom vectors with mean zero and unknown covariance matrices V t and W t. The DLM defined above amounts to treating ht\nrange level at time t, and at represents the stress range change between time t 1 and t. v t is the zero-mean Gaussian random variable representing the error of measurement at moment t. x1t and x2t are both zero-mean Gaussian random variables representing the evolution of DLM from time t 1 to t. In association with the form of DLM in Equation (1), we haveThe Bayesian forecasting philosophy is based on the description of an observed process using its probability density function (PDF). As implied by the name, the Bayesian forecasting approach commences from Bayes’ theorem, hence enabling the calculation of conditional probabilities. The details of using DLM for the recursive one-step ahead forecasting of the (posterior) distribution of monitoring-derived stress ranges under the Bayesian framework are presented as follows\nNote that in Step 4, Atþ1 is the adaptive coefficient which can be viewed as the information tuner. It scales the correction term according to the relative variances of the prior and likelihood, as measured by Rtþ1=Q tþ1 and regressor value Ftþ1. etþ1 is\nthe one-step forward forecast error, the difference between the observed value ytþ1 and its expectation f tþ1. More details\nabout the recursive one-step ahead forecast method can be found in .3. Defect detection methodologyThe proposed defect detection methodology contains three logical processes: outlier detection, change-point detection,\nand damage assessment. By comparing the real-time measurement with the predicted values, the named outlier detection and change-point detection are devised to determine whether the measurement is a single outlier or the first observation of a remarkable change, the former being executed by calculating the Bayes factor, while the latter being based on the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once a change-point is affirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for further damagePotential outlier detection is the first step in the process of the proposed defect detection approach, accomplished by the Bayes factor calculation. Bayes factor is advocated because of its straightforward and natural interpretation of evidence afforded by data. At every time step t, the Bayesian DLM can yield a PDF for the next measurement, labeled as M0. Meanwhile, an artificial alternative model labeled as M1 is defined by shifting the mean of M0 by +h. The underlying idea of outlier\ndetection is to check the current observation against both M0 and M1. For each time step t, the Bayes factor is the ratio of thewhere yt is the measurement at time t and Dt1 refers to the history information up to time t 1. In the case of Gaussianwhere h is the shift value; yt is the observation value; f t and rt are the mean and standard deviation of the forecasting distribution for observation at time t. A Bayes factor H ¼ 1 indicates that the probability of the observation derived from model M1 is identical to the probability of that derived from Model M0. For better quantitative comparison between any two models, Jeffreys suggested interpreting the Bayes factor as a scale of evidence and provided descriptive statements although\nthe partitions are somewhat arbitrary. According to his suggestion, a Bayes factor can be divided into several intervals for assessing the significance of discrimination: 1 < H < 3 is ‘barely worth mentioning’, 3 < H < 10 is ‘substantial’,\n10 < H < 30 is ‘strong’, 30 < H < 100 is ‘very strong’, and H > 100 is ‘decisive’. In this study, Hmin ¼ 10 is set as a threshold\nAfter the confirmation of Hmin and h, an uncertainty limit (ucl) can be procured by the following equationFor instance, when the confidence level a and threshold of Bayes factor Hmin are set as 90% and 10 respectively, the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt. Thus, an observation is diagnosed as an outlier if its deviation from the mean value of M0 is larger\nWith the Bayes factor defined in Equation (9), only outliers with a positive deviation can be detected. To enable the outliers with negative deviation to be detected as well, a second Bayes factor is defined asIn the automatic monitoring process, both the Bayes factors H1;t and H2;t should be examined in parallel to enable thebehavior, rather than judgments based on long past performances. Change-point is an abrupt variation in time series data,\nrepresenting a transition that occurs between states. Change-point detection aims to detect abrupt change in the generative\nprocess of sequential data. It is assumed that a sequence of observations y1; ; yT could be divided into several nonoverlapping partitions, e.g. dataset j 1, dataset j, and dataset j + 1 as shown in Fig. 2. The delineations between partitions\nare known as change-points (e.g. TOC j 1 and TOC j); the goal of change-point detection is the determination of where the\nboundary of two adjacent partitions is located in a sequence of observations. Change-point detection approaches can be classified into offline and online methods. The former needs to observe the whole sequential observations before aiming to make\ninference on the generative process of the sequence [37–40], wheras the latter aims to update the inference at each time step\nwith the newly acquired measurements from the sequence [41–43]. In particular, the Bayesian online change-point detection methods are based on computing the probability distribution of the run length.differentiate between the single-point outlier and the beginning of a continual change. To overcome this problem, cumulative Bayes factor (local Bayes factors) is recommended to detect change-point(s) in the sequence of observations, by definingwhere lmax is the maximum number of Bayes factors taken into account. Unlike Bayes factor with implicitly no historical influence in the judgement, the consecutive Bayes factors collect evidence of change over a series of observation (from time\net al. . Akin to the Bayes factor threshold for outlier detection, the threshold of maximal cumulative Bayes factors is set as Lmin ¼ 10. If the conditions Lt > Lmin and lt > lmin occur simultaneously, an alarm of change is immediately issued at time t\n(time of notification, TON). The real time of occurrence (TOC) is (t lt þ 1), that is, TOC =t lt þ 1.Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is performed to assess damage extent and quantify the\nassociated uncertainty. The proposed approach directly quantifies the likelihoods of two scenarios (e.g., the sequential observations before and after the change-point), that is, ‘‘no fault” and ‘‘fault”, and the yielded results are easy to interpret. An\nadditional merit of the proposed approach is its ability to quantify the uncertainty in damage detection. Assume that the observed sequential data can be divided into two non-overlapping partitions, the first of which is regarded as healthy\nof the observations. Thus, the damage detection problem becomes the test of H0 : l ¼ l0 versus H1 : l–l0 with\nWith the above, damage detection can be achieved by means of Bayes factor which is defined as the ratio of the probability of observations given the alternate hypothesis to the probability of observations given the null hypothesiswhere D ¼ yf 1; ; yng refers to the observed data. It is proven to bewhere refers to the mean of the observed data fy1; ; yng. If no prior information is available, the initial mean and variance can be set as q ¼ l0 and s ¼ r 0 [][. The two assumptions take the prior mean and variance in the alternative hypothesis as]where z ¼ pfn **f** i ffi l0 0 [ At each time step (i.e.,][ n][=1), the Bayes factor][ B][ is larger for the larger values of][ z][j j][, which is reasonable]and easy to interpret. The logarithm of the Bayes factor, for convenience of comparison among a larger of values, is derived asIf the Bayes factor B10 is larger than 1, the implication is that the observed data provide evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis H1 (i.e., the structure is damaged). Otherwise, the observed data are judged to support the null hypothesis H0 (i.e.,\nthe structure is healthy). As with the previous threshold, B10 10 is set as a threshold for damage indication.\nIntegrating together the outlier detection, change-point detection and damage assessment, the implementation procedures of the proposed methodology are shown in Fig. 3. Beginning at time t, the single Bayes factor is firstly evaluated to\njudge whether yt is an outlier. If not, the maximum cumulative Bayes factor Lt and run length lt for change-point detection are calculated. Once a change-point is detected, the intervention is carried out by resetting the time to the time of occurrence\n(i.e., TOC = t lt þ 1) and by adjusting the mean value of M0 to the observation yt (i.e., f t ¼ yt), and the subsequent analysis\nwill then be started at TOC. Meanwhile, Bayesian hypothesis testing is executed for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification from the current TOC to the next TOC.4. Application to in-service monitoring data of high-speed trainAn onboard monitoring system has been designed and implemented on an in-service high-speed passenger train running on the Lanzhou-Urumqi High-Speed Railway (LUHSR) in China . As shown in Fig. 4, the monitoring system is composed\nof a total of 52 FBG strain sensors, 4 FBG temperature sensors, 11 accelerometers (tri-axial) and 1 noise sensor deployed on both motor and trailer bogies. Also, one tri-axial FBG accelerometer, one video camera and two GPS sensors are installed inside a train carriage. As the present work is focused on the real-time detection of potentially defective wheels by using strain monitoring data from bogies, only the deployment of strain sensors is concerned. The strain sensors are mounted\non 4 measurement zones of the bogies: (i) the zone with the action of high loads; (ii) the stress transmission zone; (iii)\nthe zone with high responses predicted by finite element analysis; and (iv) welded joints. FBG strain (and temperature) sensors are deployed and attached to the surface of the train bogie with industrial glue and tapes, and connected to the interrogator (data logger) with laptop inside the train carriage through optical fiber cables.\nThe data utilized in this study were obtained from a monitoring schedule spanning 18 days as shown in Table 1. The total length of the LUHSR between Lanzhou and Urumqi is 1777 km. In the trip from Lanzhou to Urumqi, the high-speed train\nstops by 14 stations and travels cross 13 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 13th); in trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou, the high-speed train stops by 15 stations and travels cross 14 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 14th). During the monitoring\nperiod, the train operated at its normal speed around 200–250 km/h. The sampling rate for all the sensors was set at 5000\nSince the train wheels were lathed (lathing is a process to make wheels perfectly rounded) during the monitoring period,\nthe recorded data contain information in line with two different states (before lathing and after lathing). The wheels can be considered as potentially unhealthy (defective) before lathing and as healthy after lathing. To verify the effectiveness of theproposed real-time defect detection methodology, the strain monitoring data obtained from the bogies before and afterThe train’s dynamic responses may be influenced by different subgrade conditions of the railroad, such as ground, tunnel,\nand bridge. To eliminate the effects of different railroad conditions, the strain data recorded from the same railroad sectionbefore and after lathing, are used in each scenario. In addition, the passenger loads in different trips are deemed statistically identical and the speed of train is assumed to be constant as in normal operation. Without loss of generality, the monitoring\ndata respectively obtained from two typical railroad sections (1st and 14th) in the trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou are chosen to illustrate the proposed real-time defect detection methodology, which are from the strain gauge (MS3-7) deployed at the For the sake of brevity, the monitoring data collected from the 1st railroad section are denoted as Case 1, while those from the 14th railroad section are denoted as Case 2. Firstly, the measured strain is converted to stress for the subsequent stress\nrange calculation. For the strain gauges mounted on the steel surface, the conversion of the measured strain to stress is made by rs ¼ Ee, where E is the elasticity modulus of steel and e is the strain after eliminating the effect of varying temperatures.where em is the measured strain, T m is the measured temperature in the vicinity of the strain sensor, T 0 is the temperature at\nthe installation, and a1 is a constant coefficient. In our case, the original temperature is 4, i.e., T 0 ¼ 4. The results of temperature compensation are demonstrated in Fig. 5. It is obvious that the trend in strain responses caused by temperature\nAfterwards, the stress ranges are extracted from the monitoring-derived stress data by the application of the rainflow\ncounting algorithm. From each stress cycle, the stress range Sa is obtained by calculating the difference between the maximum stress rmax and the minimum stress rmin measured in that stress cycle, i.e., Sa ¼ rmax rmin. More details on the stress ranges extraction are given in . The stress ranges with amplitudes lower than 1 MPa need to be culled because the majority are caused by noise. To decrease the uncertainty arising from the measurement facilities, the average stress ranges for\nevery ten minutes are used as the target quantities. Due to the different lengths of the two selected railroad sections (1st and 14th), the traveling time of the train in each section is also different. This results in different data lengths. The data\nlengths of the average stress ranges in Case 1 and Case 2 are 110 and 90, respectively. Figs. and 7 show the original measured strain responses before and after lathing in Case 1 and Case 2, respectively.Following the implementation procedures mentioned before, the defect detection results for Case 1 are demonstrated in\nFigs. and 9. Fig. 8(a) shows the average stress range (red point) together with 1-step ahead prediction (blue solid line) and\nthe corresponding 90% prediction interval (grey shadow). It is observed that, although some observations at the time interval t 2 fall outside the 90% prediction interval, only the Bayes factor at time t ¼ 55 exceeds the established threshold of Hmin ¼ 10 as shown in Fig. 9(a). It is thus judged as an outlier (marked as h). The reason is that because when applying the proposed approach, the shift parameter is set as h ¼ 1:645rt, resulting in the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt while the other\nfour observations are still within the uncertainty limit. On the other hand, Fig. 9(b)–(c) shows the results of the maximum cumulative Bayes factor and the corresponding run length for change detection. It is seen that the maximum cumulative\nBayes factor values at time instants t ¼ 56; 57 and 58 are larger than the threshold of Lmin ¼ 10, while merely the run length at instant t ¼ 58 surpasses the threshold of lmin ¼ 4. Apparently, this observation at time t ¼ 58 fulfills the conditions of change-point detection causing an alarm to be issued (i.e., TON ¼ 58). The identified real occurrence time of change-point is t ¼ 55 (i.e., TOC ¼ 58 4 þ 1 ¼ 55), which coincides well with the actual time point of lathing the wheels. In accordance\nwith the real-time identification of change-point occurrence, the prediction model is refined by altering the guessed mean\nvalue at TOC, as shown in Fig. 8(b). The predictions near TOC in the refined model obviously agree well with the actual observations, thus offering a better prediction performance than that of the original model.\nThe results of defect detection by means of Bayesian hypothesis testing are illustrated in Fig. 9(d). The discrimination between ‘‘healthy” and ‘‘defective” is quantified by the logarithm value of Bayes factor. It is seen from Fig. 9(d) that the vast\nmajority of logarithm values of Bayes factor before TOC are nearly zero and below the threshold level (dotted red line), which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘healthy state” (no defect). This is consistent with the actual health condition and thus validatesthe capability of the Bayesian hypothesis testing. On the contrary, all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than 2, meaning that the corresponding Bayes factor values exceed 100. According to the classification of Bayes factor stipulated in Sub-section 3.1, this result (H > 100) favors the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity is classified as ‘‘decisive”. Indeed, wheels immediately before being sent to depot for lathing were in the state of ‘heavily defective’.\nMaking use of Eq. (21), the probabilities of damage after TOC are obtained as 100%, that is, the wheels are identified as defective with a very high confidence.\nThe defect detection results for Case 2 are similar to Case 1, and are illustrated in Figs. and 11. As seen in Fig. 11(a)–(c)\nno outlier exists throughout the whole period, but a change-point is identified, of which the time of notification is t ¼ 44 (i.e.,\nTON ¼ 44) and the real time of occurrence is t ¼ 41 (i.e., TOC ¼ 44 4 þ 1 ¼ 41). The result matches well with the actual time point when wheel lathing is inflicted. For the predictions near the change-point, the modified prediction model\n(Fig. 10(b)) offers a better performance than the original model (Fig. 10(a)). As illustrated in Fig. 11(d), all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than the threshold (dotted red line), whereas the values before TOC are within thethreshold line. The values of Bayes factor after TOC are obtained to be higher than 100 (H > 100) and the corresponding probabilities of damage are approximately 100%, which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity\nApart from the accuracy of the proposed approach, the computational efficiency is also of concern. The algorithmic implementation is performed on a Lenovo ThinkCentre M720t desktop (Lenovo, Beijing, China) with Dual Intel Core i7-8700 processor (Intel, California, USA) and 24 GB of memory. The computation times consumed in Case 1 and Case 2 are 4.0109 s and\n3.7704 s respectively. In this sense, it realizes the detection of wheel defects in real time.5. ConclusionsA novel methodology for real-time defect detection of high-speed train wheels using Bayesian forecasting and dynamic linear model (DLM) has been developed and validated in this study. First, the DLM is formulated to approximate the actual\nframework. Afterwards, three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) are elicited for outlier detection and change-point detection. After the change-point has been confirmed, damage assessment is executed by the Bayesian hypothesis testing of the sequential observations before and after the change-point. Due to accommodating the dynamic evolution process and the statistical nature of the method, the proposed approach not only possesses the ability of real-time damage detection, but also enables damage quantification (through classifying the range of Bayes factor) and uncertainty assessment (through calculating the probability of damage). The methodology is illustrated by using the onlinelathing). In the two cases addressed, wheel defects are successfully identified, hence validating the effectiveness of the developed method. The quantitative results about the damage extent and confidence would provide useful information helping to\nmake cost-effective, risk-based decisions with the aim of maintaining the operation safety of high-speed rail.\nDespite the proposed methodology being developed for wheel defect detection of high-speed trains, it can also be applied to low-speed passenger and freight trains as well as extended to SHM for a wide variety of civil infrastructure (e.g., bridges,\nbuildings and tunnels) when vibration signals are available via monitoring. In this study, the second-order polynomial DLM\nis employed to model the stress ranges, which only considers the change of stress range level and trend. However, most longterm SHM data, especially long-term strain monitoring data, are generally contaminated by trend, seasonal (cyclical) and\nregression effects, which require a more complex model. The Bayesian DLM enables the modeling of time-dependent responses of a structure by integrating appropriate components, for instance, the response with cyclical characteristics\ncan be depicted by embedding a seasonal (cyclical) component. Thus, in accordance with the nature of monitoring data,\nan appropriate Bayesian DLM enabling to describe time series data of different features, can be formulated for damage detection of a variety of structures subject to different operational/environmental conditions.Administrative Region, China (Project No. PolyU 152024/17E).

IntroductionHigh-speed rail (HSR) is being developed in Asian and European countries to satisfy the rapidly growing demand for intercity services and to shore up economic growth. The rapid\ngrowth of HSR, however, has posed great challenges regarding operation safety, reliability\nand ride comfort. Irregular wheel defects can induce high-magnitude impact forces hindering safety and ride comfort of HSR and may also cause damage to rail tracks and vehicles.real time. The proposed methodology embraces logics for (i) prognosis, (ii) potential outlier\ndetection, (iii) identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and (iv) quantification of damage extent and uncertainty. Relying on the strain monitoring data acquired from high-speed train bogies, the Bayesian DLM for characterizing the actual stress ranges is established, by which one-step forecast distribution is elicited before proceeding to the\nnext observation. The detection of change-point is executed by comparing the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM) and an alternative model\n(the mean value is shifted by a prescribed offset) to determine which better fits the actual observation. If the comparison results are in favor of the alternative model, it is claimed that a potential change has occurred. Whether such an observation is an outlier or the beginning of a genuine change (change-point), three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum\ncumulative Bayes factor and run length) are performed for further identification.

Rail accidents were occasionally caused by failures such as severe defects or fatigue of railway components. To maintain a good service quality and operation safety, it is paramount to develop\nonline monitoring techniques that not only quickly recognize faults of mission-critical HSR components but also can anticipate of long-term mechanisms and gradual deterioration in performance.\nWheelsets in a high-speed train are physically connected with and controlled by the bogie system which corrects alignment for stable running and reduces the vibration caused by wheel-rail interaction . However, the wheel performance\nprogressively deteriorates in different mechanisms (e.g., wheel flat and wheel polygonization) during the routine operation of a high-speed train . Wheel performance deterioration increases stresses experienced by the bogie system. In addition,\nthe increased stress within bogie frames caused by wheel quality deterioration can be unexpectedly large, thus posing a serious threat to the operation safety of concerned trains. According to the statistics of train accidents caused by failure in\nmechanical components during 2004 to 2007 in the United States, the wheelsets faults are the most cause with a rate of\n44.7% . Therefore, the railway managers are keen to keep wheels in an adequate condition and detect potential failure\nas soon as possible. For railway wheels, there are three different ways of estimating the conditions: physical modeling, statistical modeling and condition monitoring . However, the first two ways are not applicable to in-service\nwheel condition assessment, and in contrast, the third way is most feasible for wheel condition estimation. The monitoring approaches available to wheel defect detection can be divided into in-workshop inspection and in-service detection . The\nlatter provides the real-time data required for maintenance planning, while the former is normally carried out at workshops at fixed intervals. The commonly used in-workshop methods for wheel defect inspection include the ultrasonic techniques, infrared camera and magnetic methods . In-service monitoring approaches can be categorized as on-board and wayside methods. The on-board methods implement sensors on the train and continuously obtain comprehensive data from\nthe system. The methods of this category include magnetic technique , ultrasonic technique , acoustic technique, and vibration technique . On the other hand, wayside methods attempt to detect the wheel or vehicle performance\nby installing sensors on the rail or its surrounding areas. Such indirect measurements give rise to limited information of the wheel condition while they can monitor all train wheels going by with using only one or a few sensors. According to the type\nof sensors used, wayside detection approaches include strain sensing technology , fiber optic sensing technology ,\nultrasonic technique , vibration technique , acoustic emission , lasers and high-speed cameras . However,\nthe study on data interpretation techniques enabling the extraction of defect-sensitive features is far from sufficient.\nBayesian dynamic linear model (DLM) is an elegant system approach to handling time series data from a Bayesian perspective, which originates from the field of applied statistics and is extensively used in other fields such as economics\nand engineering [25–30]. The Bayesian DLM treats the time series as the output of a dynamic system perturbed by random disturbances. It is suitable for modeling both univariate and multivariate time series, and also for representing the structural changes, non-stationarity and irregular patterns . Unlike the classical time series method which assumes a fixed relationship between the dependent variables (response variables) and the independent variables (regressors), the DLM considers\nthe relationship changes over time and is able to directly capture time series data features, such as trend, seasonality,\nand regression effects. Moreover, the DLM allows for descriptions of temporary or permanent shifts in time series parameters that occur abruptly, which are necessary for outlier and damage detection in structural health monitoring (SHM) paradigms. Recently, Goulet and his collaborator adopted the Bayesian DLM theory in SHM to model the time-dependent\nresponses of structures by breaking them into subcomponents. In the perspective of real-time damage detection, only few studies are available. The first attempt was conducted by Lipowsky et al. with the development of a Bayesian DLM-based\nreal-time detection algorithm to evaluate the performance of a gas turbine using simulated data. Later on, Wang et al.\nand Zhang et al. adopted the above algorithm for detecting high-speed train defects by using real-world monitoring\ndata. In the previous studies, however, the real-time detection algorithm devised possesses only outlier identification and\nchange detection abilities, without the function of damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.context of Bayesian DLM, which incorporates logics for prognosis, potential outlier detection, identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and damage extent and uncertainty quantification. The Bayesian DLM is considered as a tool\nfor time series analysis, while Bayesian forecasting is executed to enable the calculation of one-step ahead forecast distribution. The change-point detection is performed by checking the current observation against the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM for current instant) as well as against an alternative model of which the mean value\nis shifted by a prescribed offset. The detection rule is that if the alternative model better fits the actual observation, a potential change is signaled. To further determine whether such an observation is only an outlier or the beginning of an actual\nchange (change-point), a specific logic is developed by introducing the Bayes factor and the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.\nThe main contributions of this study are the provision of: (i) a formula which not only enables the modeling of actual framework; (ii) three metrics (i.e., the Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) to allow for outlier\nand change-point detection in real-time manner; and (iii) an efficient way for damage extent assessment and uncertainty\nquantification. The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the Bayesian DLM theory and an elaboration of the Bayesian forecasting philosophy. Section 3 presents the defect detection methodology that incorporates logics for\noutlier detection, change-point identification, and damage assessment. In Section 4, two case studies making use of timeseries strain data acquired by fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors affixed on the bogies of an in-service high-speed train are offered to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the proposed methodology. Finally, conclusions are drawn in2. Bayesian DLM and forecastingThe Bayesian DLM is a kind of process-based Bayesian prediction model which provides a flexible way to intuitively capture how processes evolve over time. It consists of two basic equations: an observation (measurement) equation and a system (evolution) equation . The observation (measurement) equation describes the relationship between the observed\nrandom vectors with mean zero and unknown covariance matrices V t and W t. The DLM defined above amounts to treating ht\nrange level at time t, and at represents the stress range change between time t 1 and t. v t is the zero-mean Gaussian random variable representing the error of measurement at moment t. x1t and x2t are both zero-mean Gaussian random variables representing the evolution of DLM from time t 1 to t. In association with the form of DLM in Equation (1), we haveThe Bayesian forecasting philosophy is based on the description of an observed process using its probability density function (PDF). As implied by the name, the Bayesian forecasting approach commences from Bayes’ theorem, hence enabling the calculation of conditional probabilities. The details of using DLM for the recursive one-step ahead forecasting of the (posterior) distribution of monitoring-derived stress ranges under the Bayesian framework are presented as follows\nNote that in Step 4, Atþ1 is the adaptive coefficient which can be viewed as the information tuner.

More details\nabout the recursive one-step ahead forecast method can be found in .3. Defect detection methodologyThe proposed defect detection methodology contains three logical processes: outlier detection, change-point detection,\nand damage assessment. By comparing the real-time measurement with the predicted values, the named outlier detection and change-point detection are devised to determine whether the measurement is a single outlier or the first observation of a remarkable change, the former being executed by calculating the Bayes factor, while the latter being based on the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once a change-point is affirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for further damagePotential outlier detection is the first step in the process of the proposed defect detection approach, accomplished by the Bayes factor calculation. Bayes factor is advocated because of its straightforward and natural interpretation of evidence afforded by data. At every time step t, the Bayesian DLM can yield a PDF for the next measurement, labeled as M0. Meanwhile, an artificial alternative model labeled as M1 is defined by shifting the mean of M0 by +h. The underlying idea of outlier\ndetection is to check the current observation against both M0 and M1. For each time step t, the Bayes factor is the ratio of thewhere yt is the measurement at time t and Dt1 refers to the history information up to time t 1. In the case of Gaussianwhere h is the shift value; yt is the observation value; f t and rt are the mean and standard deviation of the forecasting distribution for observation at time t. A Bayes factor H ¼ 1 indicates that the probability of the observation derived from model M1 is identical to the probability of that derived from Model M0. For better quantitative comparison between any two models, Jeffreys suggested interpreting the Bayes factor as a scale of evidence and provided descriptive statements although\nthe partitions are somewhat arbitrary. According to his suggestion, a Bayes factor can be divided into several intervals for assessing the significance of discrimination: 1 < H < 3 is ‘barely worth mentioning’, 3 < H < 10 is ‘substantial’,\n10 < H < 30 is ‘strong’, 30 < H < 100 is ‘very strong’, and H > 100 is ‘decisive’. In this study, Hmin ¼ 10 is set as a threshold\nAfter the confirmation of Hmin and h, an uncertainty limit (ucl) can be procured by the following equationFor instance, when the confidence level a and threshold of Bayes factor Hmin are set as 90% and 10 respectively, the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt. Thus, an observation is diagnosed as an outlier if its deviation from the mean value of M0 is larger\nWith the Bayes factor defined in Equation (9), only outliers with a positive deviation can be detected. To enable the outliers with negative deviation to be detected as well, a second Bayes factor is defined asIn the automatic monitoring process, both the Bayes factors H1;t and H2;t should be examined in parallel to enable thebehavior, rather than judgments based on long past performances. Change-point is an abrupt variation in time series data,\nrepresenting a transition that occurs between states. Change-point detection aims to detect abrupt change in the generative\nprocess of sequential data. It is assumed that a sequence of observations y1; ; yT could be divided into several nonoverlapping partitions, e.g. dataset j 1, dataset j, and dataset j + 1 as shown in Fig. 2. The delineations between partitions\nare known as change-points (e.g. TOC j 1 and TOC j); the goal of change-point detection is the determination of where the\nboundary of two adjacent partitions is located in a sequence of observations. Change-point detection approaches can be classified into offline and online methods. The former needs to observe the whole sequential observations before aiming to make\ninference on the generative process of the sequence [37–40], wheras the latter aims to update the inference at each time step\nwith the newly acquired measurements from the sequence [41–43]. In particular, the Bayesian online change-point detection methods are based on computing the probability distribution of the run length.differentiate between the single-point outlier and the beginning of a continual change. To overcome this problem, cumulative Bayes factor (local Bayes factors) is recommended to detect change-point(s) in the sequence of observations, by definingwhere lmax is the maximum number of Bayes factors taken into account. Unlike Bayes factor with implicitly no historical influence in the judgement, the consecutive Bayes factors collect evidence of change over a series of observation (from time\net al. . Akin to the Bayes factor threshold for outlier detection, the threshold of maximal cumulative Bayes factors is set as Lmin ¼ 10. If the conditions Lt > Lmin and lt > lmin occur simultaneously, an alarm of change is immediately issued at time t\n(time of notification, TON). The real time of occurrence (TOC) is (t lt þ 1), that is, TOC =t lt þ 1.Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is performed to assess damage extent and quantify the\nassociated uncertainty. The proposed approach directly quantifies the likelihoods of two scenarios (e.g., the sequential observations before and after the change-point), that is, ‘‘no fault” and ‘‘fault”, and the yielded results are easy to interpret. An\nadditional merit of the proposed approach is its ability to quantify the uncertainty in damage detection. Assume that the observed sequential data can be divided into two non-overlapping partitions, the first of which is regarded as healthy\nof the observations. Thus, the damage detection problem becomes the test of H0 : l ¼ l0 versus H1 : l–l0 with\nWith the above, damage detection can be achieved by means of Bayes factor which is defined as the ratio of the probability of observations given the alternate hypothesis to the probability of observations given the null hypothesiswhere D ¼ yf 1; ; yng refers to the observed data. It is proven to bewhere refers to the mean of the observed data fy1; ; yng. If no prior information is available, the initial mean and variance can be set as q ¼ l0 and s ¼ r 0 [][. The two assumptions take the prior mean and variance in the alternative hypothesis as]where z ¼ pfn **f** i ffi l0 0 [ At each time step (i.e.,][ n][=1), the Bayes factor][ B][ is larger for the larger values of][ z][j j][, which is reasonable]and easy to interpret. The logarithm of the Bayes factor, for convenience of comparison among a larger of values, is derived asIf the Bayes factor B10 is larger than 1, the implication is that the observed data provide evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis H1 (i.e., the structure is damaged). Otherwise, the observed data are judged to support the null hypothesis H0 (i.e.,\nthe structure is healthy). As with the previous threshold, B10 10 is set as a threshold for damage indication.\nIntegrating together the outlier detection, change-point detection and damage assessment, the implementation procedures of the proposed methodology are shown in Fig. 3. Beginning at time t, the single Bayes factor is firstly evaluated to\njudge whether yt is an outlier. If not, the maximum cumulative Bayes factor Lt and run length lt for change-point detection are calculated. Once a change-point is detected, the intervention is carried out by resetting the time to the time of occurrence\n(i.e., TOC = t lt þ 1) and by adjusting the mean value of M0 to the observation yt (i.e., f t ¼ yt), and the subsequent analysis\nwill then be started at TOC. Meanwhile, Bayesian hypothesis testing is executed for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification from the current TOC to the next TOC.4. Application to in-service monitoring data of high-speed trainAn onboard monitoring system has been designed and implemented on an in-service high-speed passenger train running on the Lanzhou-Urumqi High-Speed Railway (LUHSR) in China . As shown in Fig. 4, the monitoring system is composed\nof a total of 52 FBG strain sensors, 4 FBG temperature sensors, 11 accelerometers (tri-axial) and 1 noise sensor deployed on both motor and trailer bogies. Also, one tri-axial FBG accelerometer, one video camera and two GPS sensors are installed inside a train carriage. As the present work is focused on the real-time detection of potentially defective wheels by using strain monitoring data from bogies, only the deployment of strain sensors is concerned. The strain sensors are mounted\non 4 measurement zones of the bogies: (i) the zone with the action of high loads; (ii) the stress transmission zone; (iii)\nthe zone with high responses predicted by finite element analysis; and (iv) welded joints. FBG strain (and temperature) sensors are deployed and attached to the surface of the train bogie with industrial glue and tapes, and connected to the interrogator (data logger) with laptop inside the train carriage through optical fiber cables.\nThe data utilized in this study were obtained from a monitoring schedule spanning 18 days as shown in Table 1. The total length of the LUHSR between Lanzhou and Urumqi is 1777 km. In the trip from Lanzhou to Urumqi, the high-speed train\nstops by 14 stations and travels cross 13 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 13th); in trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou, the high-speed train stops by 15 stations and travels cross 14 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 14th). During the monitoring\nperiod, the train operated at its normal speed around 200–250 km/h. The sampling rate for all the sensors was set at 5000\nSince the train wheels were lathed (lathing is a process to make wheels perfectly rounded) during the monitoring period,\nthe recorded data contain information in line with two different states (before lathing and after lathing). The wheels can be considered as potentially unhealthy (defective) before lathing and as healthy after lathing. To verify the effectiveness of theproposed real-time defect detection methodology, the strain monitoring data obtained from the bogies before and afterThe train’s dynamic responses may be influenced by different subgrade conditions of the railroad, such as ground, tunnel,\nand bridge. To eliminate the effects of different railroad conditions, the strain data recorded from the same railroad sectionbefore and after lathing, are used in each scenario. In addition, the passenger loads in different trips are deemed statistically identical and the speed of train is assumed to be constant as in normal operation. Without loss of generality, the monitoring\ndata respectively obtained from two typical railroad sections (1st and 14th) in the trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou are chosen to illustrate the proposed real-time defect detection methodology, which are from the strain gauge (MS3-7) deployed at the For the sake of brevity, the monitoring data collected from the 1st railroad section are denoted as Case 1, while those from the 14th railroad section are denoted as Case 2. Firstly, the measured strain is converted to stress for the subsequent stress\nrange calculation. For the strain gauges mounted on the steel surface, the conversion of the measured strain to stress is made by rs ¼ Ee, where E is the elasticity modulus of steel and e is the strain after eliminating the effect of varying temperatures.where em is the measured strain, T m is the measured temperature in the vicinity of the strain sensor, T 0 is the temperature at\nthe installation, and a1 is a constant coefficient. In our case, the original temperature is 4, i.e., T 0 ¼ 4. The results of temperature compensation are demonstrated in Fig. 5. It is obvious that the trend in strain responses caused by temperature\nAfterwards, the stress ranges are extracted from the monitoring-derived stress data by the application of the rainflow\ncounting algorithm. From each stress cycle, the stress range Sa is obtained by calculating the difference between the maximum stress rmax and the minimum stress rmin measured in that stress cycle, i.e., Sa ¼ rmax rmin. More details on the stress ranges extraction are given in . The stress ranges with amplitudes lower than 1 MPa need to be culled because the majority are caused by noise. To decrease the uncertainty arising from the measurement facilities, the average stress ranges for\nevery ten minutes are used as the target quantities. Due to the different lengths of the two selected railroad sections (1st and 14th), the traveling time of the train in each section is also different. This results in different data lengths. The data\nlengths of the average stress ranges in Case 1 and Case 2 are 110 and 90, respectively. Figs. and 7 show the original measured strain responses before and after lathing in Case 1 and Case 2, respectively.Following the implementation procedures mentioned before, the defect detection results for Case 1 are demonstrated in\nFigs. and 9. Fig. 8(a) shows the average stress range (red point) together with 1-step ahead prediction (blue solid line) and\nthe corresponding 90% prediction interval (grey shadow). It is observed that, although some observations at the time interval t 2 fall outside the 90% prediction interval, only the Bayes factor at time t ¼ 55 exceeds the established threshold of Hmin ¼ 10 as shown in Fig. 9(a). It is thus judged as an outlier (marked as h). The reason is that because when applying the proposed approach, the shift parameter is set as h ¼ 1:645rt, resulting in the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt while the other\nfour observations are still within the uncertainty limit. On the other hand, Fig. 9(b)–(c) shows the results of the maximum cumulative Bayes factor and the corresponding run length for change detection. It is seen that the maximum cumulative\nBayes factor values at time instants t ¼ 56; 57 and 58 are larger than the threshold of Lmin ¼ 10, while merely the run length at instant t ¼ 58 surpasses the threshold of lmin ¼ 4. Apparently, this observation at time t ¼ 58 fulfills the conditions of change-point detection causing an alarm to be issued (i.e., TON ¼ 58). The identified real occurrence time of change-point is t ¼ 55 (i.e., TOC ¼ 58 4 þ 1 ¼ 55), which coincides well with the actual time point of lathing the wheels. In accordance\nwith the real-time identification of change-point occurrence, the prediction model is refined by altering the guessed mean\nvalue at TOC, as shown in Fig. 8(b). The predictions near TOC in the refined model obviously agree well with the actual observations, thus offering a better prediction performance than that of the original model.\nThe results of defect detection by means of Bayesian hypothesis testing are illustrated in Fig. 9(d). The discrimination between ‘‘healthy” and ‘‘defective” is quantified by the logarithm value of Bayes factor. It is seen from Fig. 9(d) that the vast\nmajority of logarithm values of Bayes factor before TOC are nearly zero and below the threshold level (dotted red line), which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘healthy state” (no defect). This is consistent with the actual health condition and thus validatesthe capability of the Bayesian hypothesis testing. On the contrary, all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than 2, meaning that the corresponding Bayes factor values exceed 100. According to the classification of Bayes factor stipulated in Sub-section 3.1, this result (H > 100) favors the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity is classified as ‘‘decisive”. Indeed, wheels immediately before being sent to depot for lathing were in the state of ‘heavily defective’.\nMaking use of Eq. (21), the probabilities of damage after TOC are obtained as 100%, that is, the wheels are identified as defective with a very high confidence.\nThe defect detection results for Case 2 are similar to Case 1, and are illustrated in Figs. and 11. As seen in Fig. 11(a)–(c)\nno outlier exists throughout the whole period, but a change-point is identified, of which the time of notification is t ¼ 44 (i.e.,\nTON ¼ 44) and the real time of occurrence is t ¼ 41 (i.e., TOC ¼ 44 4 þ 1 ¼ 41). The result matches well with the actual time point when wheel lathing is inflicted. For the predictions near the change-point, the modified prediction model\n(Fig. 10(b)) offers a better performance than the original model (Fig. 10(a)). As illustrated in Fig. 11(d), all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than the threshold (dotted red line), whereas the values before TOC are within thethreshold line. The values of Bayes factor after TOC are obtained to be higher than 100 (H > 100) and the corresponding probabilities of damage are approximately 100%, which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity\nApart from the accuracy of the proposed approach, the computational efficiency is also of concern. The algorithmic implementation is performed on a Lenovo ThinkCentre M720t desktop (Lenovo, Beijing, China) with Dual Intel Core i7-8700 processor (Intel, California, USA) and 24 GB of memory. The computation times consumed in Case 1 and Case 2 are 4.0109 s and\n3.7704 s respectively. In this sense, it realizes the detection of wheel defects in real time.5. ConclusionsA novel methodology for real-time defect detection of high-speed train wheels using Bayesian forecasting and dynamic linear model (DLM) has been developed and validated in this study. First, the DLM is formulated to approximate the actual\nframework. Afterwards, three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) are elicited for outlier detection and change-point detection. After the change-point has been confirmed, damage assessment is executed by the Bayesian hypothesis testing of the sequential observations before and after the change-point. Due to accommodating the dynamic evolution process and the statistical nature of the method, the proposed approach not only possesses the ability of real-time damage detection, but also enables damage quantification (through classifying the range of Bayes factor) and uncertainty assessment (through calculating the probability of damage). The methodology is illustrated by using the onlinelathing). In the two cases addressed, wheel defects are successfully identified, hence validating the effectiveness of the developed method. The quantitative results about the damage extent and confidence would provide useful information helping to\nmake cost-effective, risk-based decisions with the aim of maintaining the operation safety of high-speed rail.\nDespite the proposed methodology being developed for wheel defect detection of high-speed trains, it can also be applied to low-speed passenger and freight trains as well as extended to SHM for a wide variety of civil infrastructure (e.g., bridges,\nbuildings and tunnels) when vibration signals are available via monitoring. In this study, the second-order polynomial DLM\nis employed to model the stress ranges, which only considers the change of stress range level and trend. However, most longterm SHM data, especially long-term strain monitoring data, are generally contaminated by trend, seasonal (cyclical) and\nregression effects, which require a more complex model. The Bayesian DLM enables the modeling of time-dependent responses of a structure by integrating appropriate components, for instance, the response with cyclical characteristics\ncan be depicted by embedding a seasonal (cyclical) component. Thus, in accordance with the nature of monitoring data,\nan appropriate Bayesian DLM enabling to describe time series data of different features, can be formulated for damage detection of a variety of structures subject to different operational/environmental conditions.Administrative Region, China (Project No. PolyU 152024/17E).

IntroductionHigh-speed rail (HSR) is being developed in Asian and European countries to satisfy the rapidly growing demand for intercity services and to shore up economic growth. The rapid\ngrowth of HSR, however, has posed great challenges regarding operation safety, reliability\nand ride comfort. Irregular wheel defects can induce high-magnitude impact forces hindering safety and ride comfort of HSR and may also cause damage to rail tracks and vehicles.real time. The proposed methodology embraces logics for (i) prognosis, (ii) potential outlier\ndetection, (iii) identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and (iv) quantification of damage extent and uncertainty. Relying on the strain monitoring data acquired from high-speed train bogies, the Bayesian DLM for characterizing the actual stress ranges is established, by which one-step forecast distribution is elicited before proceeding to the\nnext observation. The detection of change-point is executed by comparing the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM) and an alternative model\n(the mean value is shifted by a prescribed offset) to determine which better fits the actual observation. If the comparison results are in favor of the alternative model, it is claimed that a potential change has occurred. Whether such an observation is an outlier or the beginning of a genuine change (change-point), three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum\ncumulative Bayes factor and run length) are performed for further identification.

Rail accidents were occasionally caused by failures such as severe defects or fatigue of railway components. To maintain a good service quality and operation safety, it is paramount to develop\nonline monitoring techniques that not only quickly recognize faults of mission-critical HSR components but also can anticipate of long-term mechanisms and gradual deterioration in performance.\nWheelsets in a high-speed train are physically connected with and controlled by the bogie system which corrects alignment for stable running and reduces the vibration caused by wheel-rail interaction . However, the wheel performance\nprogressively deteriorates in different mechanisms (e.g., wheel flat and wheel polygonization) during the routine operation of a high-speed train . Wheel performance deterioration increases stresses experienced by the bogie system. In addition,\nthe increased stress within bogie frames caused by wheel quality deterioration can be unexpectedly large, thus posing a serious threat to the operation safety of concerned trains. According to the statistics of train accidents caused by failure in\nmechanical components during 2004 to 2007 in the United States, the wheelsets faults are the most cause with a rate of\n44.7% . Therefore, the railway managers are keen to keep wheels in an adequate condition and detect potential failure\nas soon as possible. For railway wheels, there are three different ways of estimating the conditions: physical modeling, statistical modeling and condition monitoring . However, the first two ways are not applicable to in-service\nwheel condition assessment, and in contrast, the third way is most feasible for wheel condition estimation. The monitoring approaches available to wheel defect detection can be divided into in-workshop inspection and in-service detection . The\nlatter provides the real-time data required for maintenance planning, while the former is normally carried out at workshops at fixed intervals. The commonly used in-workshop methods for wheel defect inspection include the ultrasonic techniques, infrared camera and magnetic methods . In-service monitoring approaches can be categorized as on-board and wayside methods. The on-board methods implement sensors on the train and continuously obtain comprehensive data from\nthe system. The methods of this category include magnetic technique , ultrasonic technique , acoustic technique, and vibration technique . On the other hand, wayside methods attempt to detect the wheel or vehicle performance\nby installing sensors on the rail or its surrounding areas. Such indirect measurements give rise to limited information of the wheel condition while they can monitor all train wheels going by with using only one or a few sensors. According to the type\nof sensors used, wayside detection approaches include strain sensing technology , fiber optic sensing technology ,\nultrasonic technique , vibration technique , acoustic emission , lasers and high-speed cameras . However,\nthe study on data interpretation techniques enabling the extraction of defect-sensitive features is far from sufficient.\nBayesian dynamic linear model (DLM) is an elegant system approach to handling time series data from a Bayesian perspective, which originates from the field of applied statistics and is extensively used in other fields such as economics\nand engineering [25–30]. The Bayesian DLM treats the time series as the output of a dynamic system perturbed by random disturbances. It is suitable for modeling both univariate and multivariate time series, and also for representing the structural changes, non-stationarity and irregular patterns . Unlike the classical time series method which assumes a fixed relationship between the dependent variables (response variables) and the independent variables (regressors), the DLM considers\nthe relationship changes over time and is able to directly capture time series data features, such as trend, seasonality,\nand regression effects. Moreover, the DLM allows for descriptions of temporary or permanent shifts in time series parameters that occur abruptly, which are necessary for outlier and damage detection in structural health monitoring (SHM) paradigms. Recently, Goulet and his collaborator adopted the Bayesian DLM theory in SHM to model the time-dependent\nresponses of structures by breaking them into subcomponents. In the perspective of real-time damage detection, only few studies are available. The first attempt was conducted by Lipowsky et al. with the development of a Bayesian DLM-based\nreal-time detection algorithm to evaluate the performance of a gas turbine using simulated data. Later on, Wang et al.\nand Zhang et al. adopted the above algorithm for detecting high-speed train defects by using real-world monitoring\ndata. In the previous studies, however, the real-time detection algorithm devised possesses only outlier identification and\nchange detection abilities, without the function of damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.context of Bayesian DLM, which incorporates logics for prognosis, potential outlier detection, identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and damage extent and uncertainty quantification. The Bayesian DLM is considered as a tool\nfor time series analysis, while Bayesian forecasting is executed to enable the calculation of one-step ahead forecast distribution. The change-point detection is performed by checking the current observation against the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM for current instant) as well as against an alternative model of which the mean value\nis shifted by a prescribed offset. The detection rule is that if the alternative model better fits the actual observation, a potential change is signaled. To further determine whether such an observation is only an outlier or the beginning of an actual\nchange (change-point), a specific logic is developed by introducing the Bayes factor and the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.\nThe main contributions of this study are the provision of: (i) a formula which not only enables the modeling of actual framework; (ii) three metrics (i.e., the Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) to allow for outlier\nand change-point detection in real-time manner; and (iii) an efficient way for damage extent assessment and uncertainty\nquantification. The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the Bayesian DLM theory and an elaboration of the Bayesian forecasting philosophy. Section 3 presents the defect detection methodology that incorporates logics for\noutlier detection, change-point identification, and damage assessment. In Section 4, two case studies making use of timeseries strain data acquired by fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors affixed on the bogies of an in-service high-speed train are offered to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the proposed methodology. Finally, conclusions are drawn in2. Bayesian DLM and forecastingThe Bayesian DLM is a kind of process-based Bayesian prediction model which provides a flexible way to intuitively capture how processes evolve over time. It consists of two basic equations: an observation (measurement) equation and a system (evolution) equation . The observation (measurement) equation describes the relationship between the observed\nrandom vectors with mean zero and unknown covariance matrices V t and W t. The DLM defined above amounts to treating ht\nrange level at time t, and at represents the stress range change between time t 1 and t. v t is the zero-mean Gaussian random variable representing the error of measurement at moment t. x1t and x2t are both zero-mean Gaussian random variables representing the evolution of DLM from time t 1 to t. In association with the form of DLM in Equation (1), we haveThe Bayesian forecasting philosophy is based on the description of an observed process using its probability density function (PDF). As implied by the name, the Bayesian forecasting approach commences from Bayes’ theorem, hence enabling the calculation of conditional probabilities. The details of using DLM for the recursive one-step ahead forecasting of the (posterior) distribution of monitoring-derived stress ranges under the Bayesian framework are presented as follows\nNote that in Step 4, Atþ1 is the adaptive coefficient which can be viewed as the information tuner. It scales the correction term according to the relative variances of the prior and likelihood, as measured by Rtþ1=Q tþ1 and regressor value Ftþ1. etþ1 is\nthe one-step forward forecast error, the difference between the observed value ytþ1 and its expectation f tþ1. More details\nabout the recursive one-step ahead forecast method can be found in .3. Defect detection methodologyThe proposed defect detection methodology contains three logical processes: outlier detection, change-point detection,\nand damage assessment. By comparing the real-time measurement with the predicted values, the named outlier detection and change-point detection are devised to determine whether the measurement is a single outlier or the first observation of a remarkable change, the former being executed by calculating the Bayes factor, while the latter being based on the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once a change-point is affirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for further damagePotential outlier detection is the first step in the process of the proposed defect detection approach, accomplished by the Bayes factor calculation. Bayes factor is advocated because of its straightforward and natural interpretation of evidence afforded by data. At every time step t, the Bayesian DLM can yield a PDF for the next measurement, labeled as M0. Meanwhile, an artificial alternative model labeled as M1 is defined by shifting the mean of M0 by +h. The underlying idea of outlier\ndetection is to check the current observation against both M0 and M1. For each time step t, the Bayes factor is the ratio of thewhere yt is the measurement at time t and Dt1 refers to the history information up to time t 1. In the case of Gaussianwhere h is the shift value; yt is the observation value; f t and rt are the mean and standard deviation of the forecasting distribution for observation at time t. A Bayes factor H ¼ 1 indicates that the probability of the observation derived from model M1 is identical to the probability of that derived from Model M0. For better quantitative comparison between any two models, Jeffreys suggested interpreting the Bayes factor as a scale of evidence and provided descriptive statements although\nthe partitions are somewhat arbitrary. According to his suggestion, a Bayes factor can be divided into several intervals for assessing the significance of discrimination: 1 < H < 3 is ‘barely worth mentioning’, 3 < H < 10 is ‘substantial’,\n10 < H < 30 is ‘strong’, 30 < H < 100 is ‘very strong’, and H > 100 is ‘decisive’. In this study, Hmin ¼ 10 is set as a threshold\nAfter the confirmation of Hmin and h, an uncertainty limit (ucl) can be procured by the following equationFor instance, when the confidence level a and threshold of Bayes factor Hmin are set as 90% and 10 respectively, the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt. Thus, an observation is diagnosed as an outlier if its deviation from the mean value of M0 is larger\nWith the Bayes factor defined in Equation (9), only outliers with a positive deviation can be detected. To enable the outliers with negative deviation to be detected as well, a second Bayes factor is defined asIn the automatic monitoring process, both the Bayes factors H1;t and H2;t should be examined in parallel to enable thebehavior, rather than judgments based on long past performances. Change-point is an abrupt variation in time series data,\nrepresenting a transition that occurs between states. Change-point detection aims to detect abrupt change in the generative\nprocess of sequential data. It is assumed that a sequence of observations y1; ; yT could be divided into several nonoverlapping partitions, e.g. dataset j 1, dataset j, and dataset j + 1 as shown in Fig. 2. The delineations between partitions\nare known as change-points (e.g. TOC j 1 and TOC j); the goal of change-point detection is the determination of where the\nboundary of two adjacent partitions is located in a sequence of observations. Change-point detection approaches can be classified into offline and online methods. The former needs to observe the whole sequential observations before aiming to make\ninference on the generative process of the sequence [37–40], wheras the latter aims to update the inference at each time step\nwith the newly acquired measurements from the sequence [41–43]. In particular, the Bayesian online change-point detection methods are based on computing the probability distribution of the run length.differentiate between the single-point outlier and the beginning of a continual change. To overcome this problem, cumulative Bayes factor (local Bayes factors) is recommended to detect change-point(s) in the sequence of observations, by definingwhere lmax is the maximum number of Bayes factors taken into account. Unlike Bayes factor with implicitly no historical influence in the judgement, the consecutive Bayes factors collect evidence of change over a series of observation (from time\net al. . Akin to the Bayes factor threshold for outlier detection, the threshold of maximal cumulative Bayes factors is set as Lmin ¼ 10. If the conditions Lt > Lmin and lt > lmin occur simultaneously, an alarm of change is immediately issued at time t\n(time of notification, TON). The real time of occurrence (TOC) is (t lt þ 1), that is, TOC =t lt þ 1.Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is performed to assess damage extent and quantify the\nassociated uncertainty. The proposed approach directly quantifies the likelihoods of two scenarios (e.g., the sequential observations before and after the change-point), that is, ‘‘no fault” and ‘‘fault”, and the yielded results are easy to interpret. An\nadditional merit of the proposed approach is its ability to quantify the uncertainty in damage detection. Assume that the observed sequential data can be divided into two non-overlapping partitions, the first of which is regarded as healthy\nof the observations. Thus, the damage detection problem becomes the test of H0 : l ¼ l0 versus H1 : l–l0 with\nWith the above, damage detection can be achieved by means of Bayes factor which is defined as the ratio of the probability of observations given the alternate hypothesis to the probability of observations given the null hypothesiswhere D ¼ yf 1; ; yng refers to the observed data. It is proven to bewhere refers to the mean of the observed data fy1; ; yng. If no prior information is available, the initial mean and variance can be set as q ¼ l0 and s ¼ r 0 [][. The two assumptions take the prior mean and variance in the alternative hypothesis as]where z ¼ pfn **f** i ffi l0 0 [ At each time step (i.e.,][ n][=1), the Bayes factor][ B][ is larger for the larger values of][ z][j j][, which is reasonable]and easy to interpret. The logarithm of the Bayes factor, for convenience of comparison among a larger of values, is derived asIf the Bayes factor B10 is larger than 1, the implication is that the observed data provide evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis H1 (i.e., the structure is damaged). Otherwise, the observed data are judged to support the null hypothesis H0 (i.e.,\nthe structure is healthy). As with the previous threshold, B10 10 is set as a threshold for damage indication.\nIntegrating together the outlier detection, change-point detection and damage assessment, the implementation procedures of the proposed methodology are shown in Fig. 3. Beginning at time t, the single Bayes factor is firstly evaluated to\njudge whether yt is an outlier. If not, the maximum cumulative Bayes factor Lt and run length lt for change-point detection are calculated. Once a change-point is detected, the intervention is carried out by resetting the time to the time of occurrence\n(i.e., TOC = t lt þ 1) and by adjusting the mean value of M0 to the observation yt (i.e., f t ¼ yt), and the subsequent analysis\nwill then be started at TOC. Meanwhile, Bayesian hypothesis testing is executed for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification from the current TOC to the next TOC.4. Application to in-service monitoring data of high-speed trainAn onboard monitoring system has been designed and implemented on an in-service high-speed passenger train running on the Lanzhou-Urumqi High-Speed Railway (LUHSR) in China . As shown in Fig. 4, the monitoring system is composed\nof a total of 52 FBG strain sensors, 4 FBG temperature sensors, 11 accelerometers (tri-axial) and 1 noise sensor deployed on both motor and trailer bogies. Also, one tri-axial FBG accelerometer, one video camera and two GPS sensors are installed inside a train carriage. As the present work is focused on the real-time detection of potentially defective wheels by using strain monitoring data from bogies, only the deployment of strain sensors is concerned. The strain sensors are mounted\non 4 measurement zones of the bogies: (i) the zone with the action of high loads; (ii) the stress transmission zone; (iii)\nthe zone with high responses predicted by finite element analysis; and (iv) welded joints. FBG strain (and temperature) sensors are deployed and attached to the surface of the train bogie with industrial glue and tapes, and connected to the interrogator (data logger) with laptop inside the train carriage through optical fiber cables.\nThe data utilized in this study were obtained from a monitoring schedule spanning 18 days as shown in Table 1. The total length of the LUHSR between Lanzhou and Urumqi is 1777 km. In the trip from Lanzhou to Urumqi, the high-speed train\nstops by 14 stations and travels cross 13 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 13th); in trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou, the high-speed train stops by 15 stations and travels cross 14 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 14th). During the monitoring\nperiod, the train operated at its normal speed around 200–250 km/h. The sampling rate for all the sensors was set at 5000\nSince the train wheels were lathed (lathing is a process to make wheels perfectly rounded) during the monitoring period,\nthe recorded data contain information in line with two different states (before lathing and after lathing). The wheels can be considered as potentially unhealthy (defective) before lathing and as healthy after lathing. To verify the effectiveness of theproposed real-time defect detection methodology, the strain monitoring data obtained from the bogies before and afterThe train’s dynamic responses may be influenced by different subgrade conditions of the railroad, such as ground, tunnel,\nand bridge. To eliminate the effects of different railroad conditions, the strain data recorded from the same railroad sectionbefore and after lathing, are used in each scenario. In addition, the passenger loads in different trips are deemed statistically identical and the speed of train is assumed to be constant as in normal operation. Without loss of generality, the monitoring\ndata respectively obtained from two typical railroad sections (1st and 14th) in the trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou are chosen to illustrate the proposed real-time defect detection methodology, which are from the strain gauge (MS3-7) deployed at the For the sake of brevity, the monitoring data collected from the 1st railroad section are denoted as Case 1, while those from the 14th railroad section are denoted as Case 2. Firstly, the measured strain is converted to stress for the subsequent stress\nrange calculation. For the strain gauges mounted on the steel surface, the conversion of the measured strain to stress is made by rs ¼ Ee, where E is the elasticity modulus of steel and e is the strain after eliminating the effect of varying temperatures.where em is the measured strain, T m is the measured temperature in the vicinity of the strain sensor, T 0 is the temperature at\nthe installation, and a1 is a constant coefficient. In our case, the original temperature is 4, i.e., T 0 ¼ 4. The results of temperature compensation are demonstrated in Fig. 5. It is obvious that the trend in strain responses caused by temperature\nAfterwards, the stress ranges are extracted from the monitoring-derived stress data by the application of the rainflow\ncounting algorithm. From each stress cycle, the stress range Sa is obtained by calculating the difference between the maximum stress rmax and the minimum stress rmin measured in that stress cycle, i.e., Sa ¼ rmax rmin. More details on the stress ranges extraction are given in . The stress ranges with amplitudes lower than 1 MPa need to be culled because the majority are caused by noise. To decrease the uncertainty arising from the measurement facilities, the average stress ranges for\nevery ten minutes are used as the target quantities. Due to the different lengths of the two selected railroad sections (1st and 14th), the traveling time of the train in each section is also different. This results in different data lengths. The data\nlengths of the average stress ranges in Case 1 and Case 2 are 110 and 90, respectively. Figs. and 7 show the original measured strain responses before and after lathing in Case 1 and Case 2, respectively.Following the implementation procedures mentioned before, the defect detection results for Case 1 are demonstrated in\nFigs. and 9. Fig. 8(a) shows the average stress range (red point) together with 1-step ahead prediction (blue solid line) and\nthe corresponding 90% prediction interval (grey shadow). It is observed that, although some observations at the time interval t 2 fall outside the 90% prediction interval, only the Bayes factor at time t ¼ 55 exceeds the established threshold of Hmin ¼ 10 as shown in Fig. 9(a). It is thus judged as an outlier (marked as h). The reason is that because when applying the proposed approach, the shift parameter is set as h ¼ 1:645rt, resulting in the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt while the other\nfour observations are still within the uncertainty limit. On the other hand, Fig. 9(b)–(c) shows the results of the maximum cumulative Bayes factor and the corresponding run length for change detection. It is seen that the maximum cumulative\nBayes factor values at time instants t ¼ 56; 57 and 58 are larger than the threshold of Lmin ¼ 10, while merely the run length at instant t ¼ 58 surpasses the threshold of lmin ¼ 4. Apparently, this observation at time t ¼ 58 fulfills the conditions of change-point detection causing an alarm to be issued (i.e., TON ¼ 58). The identified real occurrence time of change-point is t ¼ 55 (i.e., TOC ¼ 58 4 þ 1 ¼ 55), which coincides well with the actual time point of lathing the wheels. In accordance\nwith the real-time identification of change-point occurrence, the prediction model is refined by altering the guessed mean\nvalue at TOC, as shown in Fig. 8(b). The predictions near TOC in the refined model obviously agree well with the actual observations, thus offering a better prediction performance than that of the original model.\nThe results of defect detection by means of Bayesian hypothesis testing are illustrated in Fig. 9(d). The discrimination between ‘‘healthy” and ‘‘defective” is quantified by the logarithm value of Bayes factor. It is seen from Fig. 9(d) that the vast\nmajority of logarithm values of Bayes factor before TOC are nearly zero and below the threshold level (dotted red line), which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘healthy state” (no defect). This is consistent with the actual health condition and thus validatesthe capability of the Bayesian hypothesis testing. On the contrary, all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than 2, meaning that the corresponding Bayes factor values exceed 100. According to the classification of Bayes factor stipulated in Sub-section 3.1, this result (H > 100) favors the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity is classified as ‘‘decisive”. Indeed, wheels immediately before being sent to depot for lathing were in the state of ‘heavily defective’.\nMaking use of Eq. (21), the probabilities of damage after TOC are obtained as 100%, that is, the wheels are identified as defective with a very high confidence.\nThe defect detection results for Case 2 are similar to Case 1, and are illustrated in Figs. and 11. As seen in Fig. 11(a)–(c)\nno outlier exists throughout the whole period, but a change-point is identified, of which the time of notification is t ¼ 44 (i.e.,\nTON ¼ 44) and the real time of occurrence is t ¼ 41 (i.e., TOC ¼ 44 4 þ 1 ¼ 41). The result matches well with the actual time point when wheel lathing is inflicted. For the predictions near the change-point, the modified prediction model\n(Fig. 10(b)) offers a better performance than the original model (Fig. 10(a)). As illustrated in Fig. 11(d), all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than the threshold (dotted red line), whereas the values before TOC are within thethreshold line. The values of Bayes factor after TOC are obtained to be higher than 100 (H > 100) and the corresponding probabilities of damage are approximately 100%, which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity\nApart from the accuracy of the proposed approach, the computational efficiency is also of concern. The algorithmic implementation is performed on a Lenovo ThinkCentre M720t desktop (Lenovo, Beijing, China) with Dual Intel Core i7-8700 processor (Intel, California, USA) and 24 GB of memory. The computation times consumed in Case 1 and Case 2 are 4.0109 s and\n3.7704 s respectively. In this sense, it realizes the detection of wheel defects in real time.5. ConclusionsA novel methodology for real-time defect detection of high-speed train wheels using Bayesian forecasting and dynamic linear model (DLM) has been developed and validated in this study. First, the DLM is formulated to approximate the actual\nframework. Afterwards, three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) are elicited for outlier detection and change-point detection. After the change-point has been confirmed, damage assessment is executed by the Bayesian hypothesis testing of the sequential observations before and after the change-point. Due to accommodating the dynamic evolution process and the statistical nature of the method, the proposed approach not only possesses the ability of real-time damage detection, but also enables damage quantification (through classifying the range of Bayes factor) and uncertainty assessment (through calculating the probability of damage). The methodology is illustrated by using the onlinelathing). In the two cases addressed, wheel defects are successfully identified, hence validating the effectiveness of the developed method. The quantitative results about the damage extent and confidence would provide useful information helping to\nmake cost-effective, risk-based decisions with the aim of maintaining the operation safety of high-speed rail.\nDespite the proposed methodology being developed for wheel defect detection of high-speed trains, it can also be applied to low-speed passenger and freight trains as well as extended to SHM for a wide variety of civil infrastructure (e.g., bridges,\nbuildings and tunnels) when vibration signals are available via monitoring. In this study, the second-order polynomial DLM\nis employed to model the stress ranges, which only considers the change of stress range level and trend. However, most longterm SHM data, especially long-term strain monitoring data, are generally contaminated by trend, seasonal (cyclical) and\nregression effects, which require a more complex model. The Bayesian DLM enables the modeling of time-dependent responses of a structure by integrating appropriate components, for instance, the response with cyclical characteristics\ncan be depicted by embedding a seasonal (cyclical) component. Thus, in accordance with the nature of monitoring data,\nan appropriate Bayesian DLM enabling to describe time series data of different features, can be formulated for damage detection of a variety of structures subject to different operational/environmental conditions.Administrative Region, China (Project No. PolyU 152024/17E).

IntroductionHigh-speed rail (HSR) is being developed in Asian and European countries to satisfy the rapidly growing demand for intercity services and to shore up economic growth. The rapid\ngrowth of HSR, however, has posed great challenges regarding operation safety, reliability\nand ride comfort. Irregular wheel defects can induce high-magnitude impact forces hindering safety and ride comfort of HSR and may also cause damage to rail tracks and vehicles.real time. The proposed methodology embraces logics for (i) prognosis, (ii) potential outlier\ndetection, (iii) identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and (iv) quantification of damage extent and uncertainty. Relying on the strain monitoring data acquired from high-speed train bogies, the Bayesian DLM for characterizing the actual stress ranges is established, by which one-step forecast distribution is elicited before proceeding to the\nnext observation. The detection of change-point is executed by comparing the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM) and an alternative model\n(the mean value is shifted by a prescribed offset) to determine which better fits the actual observation. If the comparison results are in favor of the alternative model, it is claimed that a potential change has occurred. Whether such an observation is an outlier or the beginning of a genuine change (change-point), three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum\ncumulative Bayes factor and run length) are performed for further identification.

Rail accidents were occasionally caused by failures such as severe defects or fatigue of railway components. To maintain a good service quality and operation safety, it is paramount to develop\nonline monitoring techniques that not only quickly recognize faults of mission-critical HSR components but also can anticipate of long-term mechanisms and gradual deterioration in performance.\nWheelsets in a high-speed train are physically connected with and controlled by the bogie system which corrects alignment for stable running and reduces the vibration caused by wheel-rail interaction . However, the wheel performance\nprogressively deteriorates in different mechanisms (e.g., wheel flat and wheel polygonization) during the routine operation of a high-speed train . Wheel performance deterioration increases stresses experienced by the bogie system. In addition,\nthe increased stress within bogie frames caused by wheel quality deterioration can be unexpectedly large, thus posing a serious threat to the operation safety of concerned trains. According to the statistics of train accidents caused by failure in\nmechanical components during 2004 to 2007 in the United States, the wheelsets faults are the most cause with a rate of\n44.7% . Therefore, the railway managers are keen to keep wheels in an adequate condition and detect potential failure\nas soon as possible. For railway wheels, there are three different ways of estimating the conditions: physical modeling, statistical modeling and condition monitoring . However, the first two ways are not applicable to in-service\nwheel condition assessment, and in contrast, the third way is most feasible for wheel condition estimation. The monitoring approaches available to wheel defect detection can be divided into in-workshop inspection and in-service detection . The\nlatter provides the real-time data required for maintenance planning, while the former is normally carried out at workshops at fixed intervals. The commonly used in-workshop methods for wheel defect inspection include the ultrasonic techniques, infrared camera and magnetic methods . In-service monitoring approaches can be categorized as on-board and wayside methods. The on-board methods implement sensors on the train and continuously obtain comprehensive data from\nthe system. The methods of this category include magnetic technique , ultrasonic technique , acoustic technique, and vibration technique . On the other hand, wayside methods attempt to detect the wheel or vehicle performance\nby installing sensors on the rail or its surrounding areas. Such indirect measurements give rise to limited information of the wheel condition while they can monitor all train wheels going by with using only one or a few sensors. According to the type\nof sensors used, wayside detection approaches include strain sensing technology , fiber optic sensing technology ,\nultrasonic technique , vibration technique , acoustic emission , lasers and high-speed cameras . However,\nthe study on data interpretation techniques enabling the extraction of defect-sensitive features is far from sufficient.\nBayesian dynamic linear model (DLM) is an elegant system approach to handling time series data from a Bayesian perspective, which originates from the field of applied statistics and is extensively used in other fields such as economics\nand engineering [25–30]. The Bayesian DLM treats the time series as the output of a dynamic system perturbed by random disturbances. It is suitable for modeling both univariate and multivariate time series, and also for representing the structural changes, non-stationarity and irregular patterns . Unlike the classical time series method which assumes a fixed relationship between the dependent variables (response variables) and the independent variables (regressors), the DLM considers\nthe relationship changes over time and is able to directly capture time series data features, such as trend, seasonality,\nand regression effects. Moreover, the DLM allows for descriptions of temporary or permanent shifts in time series parameters that occur abruptly, which are necessary for outlier and damage detection in structural health monitoring (SHM) paradigms. Recently, Goulet and his collaborator adopted the Bayesian DLM theory in SHM to model the time-dependent\nresponses of structures by breaking them into subcomponents. In the perspective of real-time damage detection, only few studies are available. The first attempt was conducted by Lipowsky et al. with the development of a Bayesian DLM-based\nreal-time detection algorithm to evaluate the performance of a gas turbine using simulated data. Later on, Wang et al.\nand Zhang et al. adopted the above algorithm for detecting high-speed train defects by using real-world monitoring\ndata. In the previous studies, however, the real-time detection algorithm devised possesses only outlier identification and\nchange detection abilities, without the function of damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.context of Bayesian DLM, which incorporates logics for prognosis, potential outlier detection, identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and damage extent and uncertainty quantification. The Bayesian DLM is considered as a tool\nfor time series analysis, while Bayesian forecasting is executed to enable the calculation of one-step ahead forecast distribution. The change-point detection is performed by checking the current observation against the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM for current instant) as well as against an alternative model of which the mean value\nis shifted by a prescribed offset. The detection rule is that if the alternative model better fits the actual observation, a potential change is signaled. To further determine whether such an observation is only an outlier or the beginning of an actual\nchange (change-point), a specific logic is developed by introducing the Bayes factor and the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.\nThe main contributions of this study are the provision of: (i) a formula which not only enables the modeling of actual framework; (ii) three metrics (i.e., the Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) to allow for outlier\nand change-point detection in real-time manner; and (iii) an efficient way for damage extent assessment and uncertainty\nquantification. The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the Bayesian DLM theory and an elaboration of the Bayesian forecasting philosophy. Section 3 presents the defect detection methodology that incorporates logics for\noutlier detection, change-point identification, and damage assessment. In Section 4, two case studies making use of timeseries strain data acquired by fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors affixed on the bogies of an in-service high-speed train are offered to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the proposed methodology. Finally, conclusions are drawn in2. Bayesian DLM and forecastingThe Bayesian DLM is a kind of process-based Bayesian prediction model which provides a flexible way to intuitively capture how processes evolve over time. It consists of two basic equations: an observation (measurement) equation and a system (evolution) equation . The observation (measurement) equation describes the relationship between the observed\nrandom vectors with mean zero and unknown covariance matrices V t and W t. The DLM defined above amounts to treating ht\nrange level at time t, and at represents the stress range change between time t 1 and t. v t is the zero-mean Gaussian random variable representing the error of measurement at moment t. x1t and x2t are both zero-mean Gaussian random variables representing the evolution of DLM from time t 1 to t. In association with the form of DLM in Equation (1), we haveThe Bayesian forecasting philosophy is based on the description of an observed process using its probability density function (PDF). As implied by the name, the Bayesian forecasting approach commences from Bayes’ theorem, hence enabling the calculation of conditional probabilities. The details of using DLM for the recursive one-step ahead forecasting of the (posterior) distribution of monitoring-derived stress ranges under the Bayesian framework are presented as follows\nNote that in Step 4, Atþ1 is the adaptive coefficient which can be viewed as the information tuner. It scales the correction term according to the relative variances of the prior and likelihood, as measured by Rtþ1=Q tþ1 and regressor value Ftþ1. etþ1 is\nthe one-step forward forecast error, the difference between the observed value ytþ1 and its expectation f tþ1. More details\nabout the recursive one-step ahead forecast method can be found in .3. Defect detection methodologyThe proposed defect detection methodology contains three logical processes: outlier detection, change-point detection,\nand damage assessment. By comparing the real-time measurement with the predicted values, the named outlier detection and change-point detection are devised to determine whether the measurement is a single outlier or the first observation of a remarkable change, the former being executed by calculating the Bayes factor, while the latter being based on the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once a change-point is affirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for further damagePotential outlier detection is the first step in the process of the proposed defect detection approach, accomplished by the Bayes factor calculation. Bayes factor is advocated because of its straightforward and natural interpretation of evidence afforded by data. At every time step t, the Bayesian DLM can yield a PDF for the next measurement, labeled as M0. Meanwhile, an artificial alternative model labeled as M1 is defined by shifting the mean of M0 by +h. The underlying idea of outlier\ndetection is to check the current observation against both M0 and M1. For each time step t, the Bayes factor is the ratio of thewhere yt is the measurement at time t and Dt1 refers to the history information up to time t 1. In the case of Gaussianwhere h is the shift value; yt is the observation value; f t and rt are the mean and standard deviation of the forecasting distribution for observation at time t. A Bayes factor H ¼ 1 indicates that the probability of the observation derived from model M1 is identical to the probability of that derived from Model M0. For better quantitative comparison between any two models, Jeffreys suggested interpreting the Bayes factor as a scale of evidence and provided descriptive statements although\nthe partitions are somewhat arbitrary. According to his suggestion, a Bayes factor can be divided into several intervals for assessing the significance of discrimination: 1 < H < 3 is ‘barely worth mentioning’, 3 < H < 10 is ‘substantial’,\n10 < H < 30 is ‘strong’, 30 < H < 100 is ‘very strong’, and H > 100 is ‘decisive’. In this study, Hmin ¼ 10 is set as a threshold\nAfter the confirmation of Hmin and h, an uncertainty limit (ucl) can be procured by the following equationFor instance, when the confidence level a and threshold of Bayes factor Hmin are set as 90% and 10 respectively, the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt. Thus, an observation is diagnosed as an outlier if its deviation from the mean value of M0 is larger\nWith the Bayes factor defined in Equation (9), only outliers with a positive deviation can be detected. To enable the outliers with negative deviation to be detected as well, a second Bayes factor is defined asIn the automatic monitoring process, both the Bayes factors H1;t and H2;t should be examined in parallel to enable thebehavior, rather than judgments based on long past performances. Change-point is an abrupt variation in time series data,\nrepresenting a transition that occurs between states. Change-point detection aims to detect abrupt change in the generative\nprocess of sequential data. It is assumed that a sequence of observations y1; ; yT could be divided into several nonoverlapping partitions, e.g. dataset j 1, dataset j, and dataset j + 1 as shown in Fig. 2. The delineations between partitions\nare known as change-points (e.g. TOC j 1 and TOC j); the goal of change-point detection is the determination of where the\nboundary of two adjacent partitions is located in a sequence of observations. Change-point detection approaches can be classified into offline and online methods. The former needs to observe the whole sequential observations before aiming to make\ninference on the generative process of the sequence [37–40], wheras the latter aims to update the inference at each time step\nwith the newly acquired measurements from the sequence [41–43]. In particular, the Bayesian online change-point detection methods are based on computing the probability distribution of the run length.differentiate between the single-point outlier and the beginning of a continual change. To overcome this problem, cumulative Bayes factor (local Bayes factors) is recommended to detect change-point(s) in the sequence of observations, by definingwhere lmax is the maximum number of Bayes factors taken into account. Unlike Bayes factor with implicitly no historical influence in the judgement, the consecutive Bayes factors collect evidence of change over a series of observation (from time\net al. . Akin to the Bayes factor threshold for outlier detection, the threshold of maximal cumulative Bayes factors is set as Lmin ¼ 10. If the conditions Lt > Lmin and lt > lmin occur simultaneously, an alarm of change is immediately issued at time t\n(time of notification, TON). The real time of occurrence (TOC) is (t lt þ 1), that is, TOC =t lt þ 1.Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is performed to assess damage extent and quantify the\nassociated uncertainty. The proposed approach directly quantifies the likelihoods of two scenarios (e.g., the sequential observations before and after the change-point), that is, ‘‘no fault” and ‘‘fault”, and the yielded results are easy to interpret. An\nadditional merit of the proposed approach is its ability to quantify the uncertainty in damage detection. Assume that the observed sequential data can be divided into two non-overlapping partitions, the first of which is regarded as healthy\nof the observations. Thus, the damage detection problem becomes the test of H0 : l ¼ l0 versus H1 : l–l0 with\nWith the above, damage detection can be achieved by means of Bayes factor which is defined as the ratio of the probability of observations given the alternate hypothesis to the probability of observations given the null hypothesiswhere D ¼ yf 1; ; yng refers to the observed data. It is proven to bewhere refers to the mean of the observed data fy1; ; yng. If no prior information is available, the initial mean and variance can be set as q ¼ l0 and s ¼ r 0 [][. The two assumptions take the prior mean and variance in the alternative hypothesis as]where z ¼ pfn **f** i ffi l0 0 [ At each time step (i.e.,][ n][=1), the Bayes factor][ B][ is larger for the larger values of][ z][j j][, which is reasonable]and easy to interpret. The logarithm of the Bayes factor, for convenience of comparison among a larger of values, is derived asIf the Bayes factor B10 is larger than 1, the implication is that the observed data provide evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis H1 (i.e., the structure is damaged). Otherwise, the observed data are judged to support the null hypothesis H0 (i.e.,\nthe structure is healthy). As with the previous threshold, B10 10 is set as a threshold for damage indication.\nIntegrating together the outlier detection, change-point detection and damage assessment, the implementation procedures of the proposed methodology are shown in Fig. 3. Beginning at time t, the single Bayes factor is firstly evaluated to\njudge whether yt is an outlier. If not, the maximum cumulative Bayes factor Lt and run length lt for change-point detection are calculated. Once a change-point is detected, the intervention is carried out by resetting the time to the time of occurrence\n(i.e., TOC = t lt þ 1) and by adjusting the mean value of M0 to the observation yt (i.e., f t ¼ yt), and the subsequent analysis\nwill then be started at TOC. Meanwhile, Bayesian hypothesis testing is executed for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification from the current TOC to the next TOC.4. Application to in-service monitoring data of high-speed trainAn onboard monitoring system has been designed and implemented on an in-service high-speed passenger train running on the Lanzhou-Urumqi High-Speed Railway (LUHSR) in China . As shown in Fig. 4, the monitoring system is composed\nof a total of 52 FBG strain sensors, 4 FBG temperature sensors, 11 accelerometers (tri-axial) and 1 noise sensor deployed on both motor and trailer bogies. Also, one tri-axial FBG accelerometer, one video camera and two GPS sensors are installed inside a train carriage. As the present work is focused on the real-time detection of potentially defective wheels by using strain monitoring data from bogies, only the deployment of strain sensors is concerned. The strain sensors are mounted\non 4 measurement zones of the bogies: (i) the zone with the action of high loads; (ii) the stress transmission zone; (iii)\nthe zone with high responses predicted by finite element analysis; and (iv) welded joints. FBG strain (and temperature) sensors are deployed and attached to the surface of the train bogie with industrial glue and tapes, and connected to the interrogator (data logger) with laptop inside the train carriage through optical fiber cables.\nThe data utilized in this study were obtained from a monitoring schedule spanning 18 days as shown in Table 1. The total length of the LUHSR between Lanzhou and Urumqi is 1777 km. In the trip from Lanzhou to Urumqi, the high-speed train\nstops by 14 stations and travels cross 13 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 13th); in trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou, the high-speed train stops by 15 stations and travels cross 14 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 14th). During the monitoring\nperiod, the train operated at its normal speed around 200–250 km/h. The sampling rate for all the sensors was set at 5000\nSince the train wheels were lathed (lathing is a process to make wheels perfectly rounded) during the monitoring period,\nthe recorded data contain information in line with two different states (before lathing and after lathing). The wheels can be considered as potentially unhealthy (defective) before lathing and as healthy after lathing. To verify the effectiveness of theproposed real-time defect detection methodology, the strain monitoring data obtained from the bogies before and afterThe train’s dynamic responses may be influenced by different subgrade conditions of the railroad, such as ground, tunnel,\nand bridge. To eliminate the effects of different railroad conditions, the strain data recorded from the same railroad sectionbefore and after lathing, are used in each scenario. In addition, the passenger loads in different trips are deemed statistically identical and the speed of train is assumed to be constant as in normal operation. Without loss of generality, the monitoring\ndata respectively obtained from two typical railroad sections (1st and 14th) in the trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou are chosen to illustrate the proposed real-time defect detection methodology, which are from the strain gauge (MS3-7) deployed at the For the sake of brevity, the monitoring data collected from the 1st railroad section are denoted as Case 1, while those from the 14th railroad section are denoted as Case 2. Firstly, the measured strain is converted to stress for the subsequent stress\nrange calculation. For the strain gauges mounted on the steel surface, the conversion of the measured strain to stress is made by rs ¼ Ee, where E is the elasticity modulus of steel and e is the strain after eliminating the effect of varying temperatures.where em is the measured strain, T m is the measured temperature in the vicinity of the strain sensor, T 0 is the temperature at\nthe installation, and a1 is a constant coefficient. In our case, the original temperature is 4, i.e., T 0 ¼ 4. The results of temperature compensation are demonstrated in Fig. 5. It is obvious that the trend in strain responses caused by temperature\nAfterwards, the stress ranges are extracted from the monitoring-derived stress data by the application of the rainflow\ncounting algorithm. From each stress cycle, the stress range Sa is obtained by calculating the difference between the maximum stress rmax and the minimum stress rmin measured in that stress cycle, i.e., Sa ¼ rmax rmin. More details on the stress ranges extraction are given in . The stress ranges with amplitudes lower than 1 MPa need to be culled because the majority are caused by noise. To decrease the uncertainty arising from the measurement facilities, the average stress ranges for\nevery ten minutes are used as the target quantities. Due to the different lengths of the two selected railroad sections (1st and 14th), the traveling time of the train in each section is also different. This results in different data lengths. The data\nlengths of the average stress ranges in Case 1 and Case 2 are 110 and 90, respectively. Figs. and 7 show the original measured strain responses before and after lathing in Case 1 and Case 2, respectively.Following the implementation procedures mentioned before, the defect detection results for Case 1 are demonstrated in\nFigs. and 9. Fig. 8(a) shows the average stress range (red point) together with 1-step ahead prediction (blue solid line) and\nthe corresponding 90% prediction interval (grey shadow). It is observed that, although some observations at the time interval t 2 fall outside the 90% prediction interval, only the Bayes factor at time t ¼ 55 exceeds the established threshold of Hmin ¼ 10 as shown in Fig. 9(a). It is thus judged as an outlier (marked as h). The reason is that because when applying the proposed approach, the shift parameter is set as h ¼ 1:645rt, resulting in the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt while the other\nfour observations are still within the uncertainty limit. On the other hand, Fig. 9(b)–(c) shows the results of the maximum cumulative Bayes factor and the corresponding run length for change detection. It is seen that the maximum cumulative\nBayes factor values at time instants t ¼ 56; 57 and 58 are larger than the threshold of Lmin ¼ 10, while merely the run length at instant t ¼ 58 surpasses the threshold of lmin ¼ 4. Apparently, this observation at time t ¼ 58 fulfills the conditions of change-point detection causing an alarm to be issued (i.e., TON ¼ 58). The identified real occurrence time of change-point is t ¼ 55 (i.e., TOC ¼ 58 4 þ 1 ¼ 55), which coincides well with the actual time point of lathing the wheels. In accordance\nwith the real-time identification of change-point occurrence, the prediction model is refined by altering the guessed mean\nvalue at TOC, as shown in Fig. 8(b). The predictions near TOC in the refined model obviously agree well with the actual observations, thus offering a better prediction performance than that of the original model.\nThe results of defect detection by means of Bayesian hypothesis testing are illustrated in Fig. 9(d). The discrimination between ‘‘healthy” and ‘‘defective” is quantified by the logarithm value of Bayes factor. It is seen from Fig. 9(d) that the vast\nmajority of logarithm values of Bayes factor before TOC are nearly zero and below the threshold level (dotted red line), which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘healthy state” (no defect). This is consistent with the actual health condition and thus validatesthe capability of the Bayesian hypothesis testing. On the contrary, all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than 2, meaning that the corresponding Bayes factor values exceed 100. According to the classification of Bayes factor stipulated in Sub-section 3.1, this result (H > 100) favors the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity is classified as ‘‘decisive”. Indeed, wheels immediately before being sent to depot for lathing were in the state of ‘heavily defective’.\nMaking use of Eq. (21), the probabilities of damage after TOC are obtained as 100%, that is, the wheels are identified as defective with a very high confidence.\nThe defect detection results for Case 2 are similar to Case 1, and are illustrated in Figs. and 11. As seen in Fig. 11(a)–(c)\nno outlier exists throughout the whole period, but a change-point is identified, of which the time of notification is t ¼ 44 (i.e.,\nTON ¼ 44) and the real time of occurrence is t ¼ 41 (i.e., TOC ¼ 44 4 þ 1 ¼ 41). The result matches well with the actual time point when wheel lathing is inflicted. For the predictions near the change-point, the modified prediction model\n(Fig. 10(b)) offers a better performance than the original model (Fig. 10(a)). As illustrated in Fig. 11(d), all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than the threshold (dotted red line), whereas the values before TOC are within thethreshold line. The values of Bayes factor after TOC are obtained to be higher than 100 (H > 100) and the corresponding probabilities of damage are approximately 100%, which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity\nApart from the accuracy of the proposed approach, the computational efficiency is also of concern. The algorithmic implementation is performed on a Lenovo ThinkCentre M720t desktop (Lenovo, Beijing, China) with Dual Intel Core i7-8700 processor (Intel, California, USA) and 24 GB of memory. The computation times consumed in Case 1 and Case 2 are 4.0109 s and\n3.7704 s respectively. In this sense, it realizes the detection of wheel defects in real time.5. ConclusionsA novel methodology for real-time defect detection of high-speed train wheels using Bayesian forecasting and dynamic linear model (DLM) has been developed and validated in this study. First, the DLM is formulated to approximate the actual\nframework. Afterwards, three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) are elicited for outlier detection and change-point detection. After the change-point has been confirmed, damage assessment is executed by the Bayesian hypothesis testing of the sequential observations before and after the change-point. Due to accommodating the dynamic evolution process and the statistical nature of the method, the proposed approach not only possesses the ability of real-time damage detection, but also enables damage quantification (through classifying the range of Bayes factor) and uncertainty assessment (through calculating the probability of damage). The methodology is illustrated by using the onlinelathing). In the two cases addressed, wheel defects are successfully identified, hence validating the effectiveness of the developed method. The quantitative results about the damage extent and confidence would provide useful information helping to\nmake cost-effective, risk-based decisions with the aim of maintaining the operation safety of high-speed rail.\nDespite the proposed methodology being developed for wheel defect detection of high-speed trains, it can also be applied to low-speed passenger and freight trains as well as extended to SHM for a wide variety of civil infrastructure (e.g., bridges,\nbuildings and tunnels) when vibration signals are available via monitoring. In this study, the second-order polynomial DLM\nis employed to model the stress ranges, which only considers the change of stress range level and trend. However, most longterm SHM data, especially long-term strain monitoring data, are generally contaminated by trend, seasonal (cyclical) and\nregression effects, which require a more complex model. The Bayesian DLM enables the modeling of time-dependent responses of a structure by integrating appropriate components, for instance, the response with cyclical characteristics\ncan be depicted by embedding a seasonal (cyclical) component. Thus, in accordance with the nature of monitoring data,\nan appropriate Bayesian DLM enabling to describe time series data of different features, can be formulated for damage detection of a variety of structures subject to different operational/environmental conditions.Administrative Region, China (Project No. PolyU 152024/17E).

IntroductionHigh-speed rail (HSR) is being developed in Asian and European countries to satisfy the rapidly growing demand for intercity services and to shore up economic growth. The rapid\ngrowth of HSR, however, has posed great challenges regarding operation safety, reliability\nand ride comfort. Irregular wheel defects can induce high-magnitude impact forces hindering safety and ride comfort of HSR and may also cause damage to rail tracks and vehicles.real time. The proposed methodology embraces logics for (i) prognosis, (ii) potential outlier\ndetection, (iii) identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and (iv) quantification of damage extent and uncertainty. Relying on the strain monitoring data acquired from high-speed train bogies, the Bayesian DLM for characterizing the actual stress ranges is established, by which one-step forecast distribution is elicited before proceeding to the\nnext observation. The detection of change-point is executed by comparing the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM) and an alternative model\n(the mean value is shifted by a prescribed offset) to determine which better fits the actual observation. If the comparison results are in favor of the alternative model, it is claimed that a potential change has occurred. Whether such an observation is an outlier or the beginning of a genuine change (change-point), three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum\ncumulative Bayes factor and run length) are performed for further identification. Once a change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for the purpose of\ndamage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification. A severe change, if identified,\ndefects.

Rail accidents were occasionally caused by failures such as severe defects or fatigue of railway components. To maintain a good service quality and operation safety, it is paramount to develop\nonline monitoring techniques that not only quickly recognize faults of mission-critical HSR components but also can anticipate of long-term mechanisms and gradual deterioration in performance.\nWheelsets in a high-speed train are physically connected with and controlled by the bogie system which corrects alignment for stable running and reduces the vibration caused by wheel-rail interaction . However, the wheel performance\nprogressively deteriorates in different mechanisms (e.g., wheel flat and wheel polygonization) during the routine operation of a high-speed train . Wheel performance deterioration increases stresses experienced by the bogie system. In addition,\nthe increased stress within bogie frames caused by wheel quality deterioration can be unexpectedly large, thus posing a serious threat to the operation safety of concerned trains. According to the statistics of train accidents caused by failure in\nmechanical components during 2004 to 2007 in the United States, the wheelsets faults are the most cause with a rate of\n44.7% . Therefore, the railway managers are keen to keep wheels in an adequate condition and detect potential failure\nas soon as possible. For railway wheels, there are three different ways of estimating the conditions: physical modeling, statistical modeling and condition monitoring . However, the first two ways are not applicable to in-service\nwheel condition assessment, and in contrast, the third way is most feasible for wheel condition estimation. The monitoring approaches available to wheel defect detection can be divided into in-workshop inspection and in-service detection . The\nlatter provides the real-time data required for maintenance planning, while the former is normally carried out at workshops at fixed intervals. The commonly used in-workshop methods for wheel defect inspection include the ultrasonic techniques, infrared camera and magnetic methods . In-service monitoring approaches can be categorized as on-board and wayside methods. The on-board methods implement sensors on the train and continuously obtain comprehensive data from\nthe system. The methods of this category include magnetic technique , ultrasonic technique , acoustic technique, and vibration technique . On the other hand, wayside methods attempt to detect the wheel or vehicle performance\nby installing sensors on the rail or its surrounding areas. Such indirect measurements give rise to limited information of the wheel condition while they can monitor all train wheels going by with using only one or a few sensors. According to the type\nof sensors used, wayside detection approaches include strain sensing technology , fiber optic sensing technology ,\nultrasonic technique , vibration technique , acoustic emission , lasers and high-speed cameras . However,\nthe study on data interpretation techniques enabling the extraction of defect-sensitive features is far from sufficient.\nBayesian dynamic linear model (DLM) is an elegant system approach to handling time series data from a Bayesian perspective, which originates from the field of applied statistics and is extensively used in other fields such as economics\nand engineering [25–30]. The Bayesian DLM treats the time series as the output of a dynamic system perturbed by random disturbances. It is suitable for modeling both univariate and multivariate time series, and also for representing the structural changes, non-stationarity and irregular patterns . Unlike the classical time series method which assumes a fixed relationship between the dependent variables (response variables) and the independent variables (regressors), the DLM considers\nthe relationship changes over time and is able to directly capture time series data features, such as trend, seasonality,\nand regression effects. Moreover, the DLM allows for descriptions of temporary or permanent shifts in time series parameters that occur abruptly, which are necessary for outlier and damage detection in structural health monitoring (SHM) paradigms. Recently, Goulet and his collaborator adopted the Bayesian DLM theory in SHM to model the time-dependent\nresponses of structures by breaking them into subcomponents. In the perspective of real-time damage detection, only few studies are available. The first attempt was conducted by Lipowsky et al. with the development of a Bayesian DLM-based\nreal-time detection algorithm to evaluate the performance of a gas turbine using simulated data. Later on, Wang et al.\nand Zhang et al. adopted the above algorithm for detecting high-speed train defects by using real-world monitoring\ndata. In the previous studies, however, the real-time detection algorithm devised possesses only outlier identification and\nchange detection abilities, without the function of damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.context of Bayesian DLM, which incorporates logics for prognosis, potential outlier detection, identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and damage extent and uncertainty quantification. The Bayesian DLM is considered as a tool\nfor time series analysis, while Bayesian forecasting is executed to enable the calculation of one-step ahead forecast distribution. The change-point detection is performed by checking the current observation against the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM for current instant) as well as against an alternative model of which the mean value\nis shifted by a prescribed offset. The detection rule is that if the alternative model better fits the actual observation, a potential change is signaled. To further determine whether such an observation is only an outlier or the beginning of an actual\nchange (change-point), a specific logic is developed by introducing the Bayes factor and the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.\nThe main contributions of this study are the provision of: (i) a formula which not only enables the modeling of actual framework; (ii) three metrics (i.e., the Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) to allow for outlier\nand change-point detection in real-time manner; and (iii) an efficient way for damage extent assessment and uncertainty\nquantification. The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the Bayesian DLM theory and an elaboration of the Bayesian forecasting philosophy. Section 3 presents the defect detection methodology that incorporates logics for\noutlier detection, change-point identification, and damage assessment. In Section 4, two case studies making use of timeseries strain data acquired by fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors affixed on the bogies of an in-service high-speed train are offered to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the proposed methodology. Finally, conclusions are drawn in2. Bayesian DLM and forecastingThe Bayesian DLM is a kind of process-based Bayesian prediction model which provides a flexible way to intuitively capture how processes evolve over time. It consists of two basic equations: an observation (measurement) equation and a system (evolution) equation . The observation (measurement) equation describes the relationship between the observed\nrandom vectors with mean zero and unknown covariance matrices V t and W t. The DLM defined above amounts to treating ht\nrange level at time t, and at represents the stress range change between time t 1 and t. v t is the zero-mean Gaussian random variable representing the error of measurement at moment t. x1t and x2t are both zero-mean Gaussian random variables representing the evolution of DLM from time t 1 to t. In association with the form of DLM in Equation (1), we haveThe Bayesian forecasting philosophy is based on the description of an observed process using its probability density function (PDF). As implied by the name, the Bayesian forecasting approach commences from Bayes’ theorem, hence enabling the calculation of conditional probabilities. The details of using DLM for the recursive one-step ahead forecasting of the (posterior) distribution of monitoring-derived stress ranges under the Bayesian framework are presented as follows\nNote that in Step 4, Atþ1 is the adaptive coefficient which can be viewed as the information tuner. It scales the correction term according to the relative variances of the prior and likelihood, as measured by Rtþ1=Q tþ1 and regressor value Ftþ1. etþ1 is\nthe one-step forward forecast error, the difference between the observed value ytþ1 and its expectation f tþ1. More details\nabout the recursive one-step ahead forecast method can be found in .3. Defect detection methodologyThe proposed defect detection methodology contains three logical processes: outlier detection, change-point detection,\nand damage assessment. By comparing the real-time measurement with the predicted values, the named outlier detection and change-point detection are devised to determine whether the measurement is a single outlier or the first observation of a remarkable change, the former being executed by calculating the Bayes factor, while the latter being based on the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once a change-point is affirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for further damagePotential outlier detection is the first step in the process of the proposed defect detection approach, accomplished by the Bayes factor calculation. Bayes factor is advocated because of its straightforward and natural interpretation of evidence afforded by data. At every time step t, the Bayesian DLM can yield a PDF for the next measurement, labeled as M0. Meanwhile, an artificial alternative model labeled as M1 is defined by shifting the mean of M0 by +h. The underlying idea of outlier\ndetection is to check the current observation against both M0 and M1. For each time step t, the Bayes factor is the ratio of thewhere yt is the measurement at time t and Dt1 refers to the history information up to time t 1. In the case of Gaussianwhere h is the shift value; yt is the observation value; f t and rt are the mean and standard deviation of the forecasting distribution for observation at time t. A Bayes factor H ¼ 1 indicates that the probability of the observation derived from model M1 is identical to the probability of that derived from Model M0. For better quantitative comparison between any two models, Jeffreys suggested interpreting the Bayes factor as a scale of evidence and provided descriptive statements although\nthe partitions are somewhat arbitrary. According to his suggestion, a Bayes factor can be divided into several intervals for assessing the significance of discrimination: 1 < H < 3 is ‘barely worth mentioning’, 3 < H < 10 is ‘substantial’,\n10 < H < 30 is ‘strong’, 30 < H < 100 is ‘very strong’, and H > 100 is ‘decisive’. In this study, Hmin ¼ 10 is set as a threshold\nAfter the confirmation of Hmin and h, an uncertainty limit (ucl) can be procured by the following equationFor instance, when the confidence level a and threshold of Bayes factor Hmin are set as 90% and 10 respectively, the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt. Thus, an observation is diagnosed as an outlier if its deviation from the mean value of M0 is larger\nWith the Bayes factor defined in Equation (9), only outliers with a positive deviation can be detected. To enable the outliers with negative deviation to be detected as well, a second Bayes factor is defined asIn the automatic monitoring process, both the Bayes factors H1;t and H2;t should be examined in parallel to enable thebehavior, rather than judgments based on long past performances. Change-point is an abrupt variation in time series data,\nrepresenting a transition that occurs between states. Change-point detection aims to detect abrupt change in the generative\nprocess of sequential data. It is assumed that a sequence of observations y1; ; yT could be divided into several nonoverlapping partitions, e.g. dataset j 1, dataset j, and dataset j + 1 as shown in Fig. 2. The delineations between partitions\nare known as change-points (e.g. TOC j 1 and TOC j); the goal of change-point detection is the determination of where the\nboundary of two adjacent partitions is located in a sequence of observations. Change-point detection approaches can be classified into offline and online methods. The former needs to observe the whole sequential observations before aiming to make\ninference on the generative process of the sequence [37–40], wheras the latter aims to update the inference at each time step\nwith the newly acquired measurements from the sequence [41–43]. In particular, the Bayesian online change-point detection methods are based on computing the probability distribution of the run length.differentiate between the single-point outlier and the beginning of a continual change. To overcome this problem, cumulative Bayes factor (local Bayes factors) is recommended to detect change-point(s) in the sequence of observations, by definingwhere lmax is the maximum number of Bayes factors taken into account. Unlike Bayes factor with implicitly no historical influence in the judgement, the consecutive Bayes factors collect evidence of change over a series of observation (from time\net al. . Akin to the Bayes factor threshold for outlier detection, the threshold of maximal cumulative Bayes factors is set as Lmin ¼ 10. If the conditions Lt > Lmin and lt > lmin occur simultaneously, an alarm of change is immediately issued at time t\n(time of notification, TON). The real time of occurrence (TOC) is (t lt þ 1), that is, TOC =t lt þ 1.Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is performed to assess damage extent and quantify the\nassociated uncertainty. The proposed approach directly quantifies the likelihoods of two scenarios (e.g., the sequential observations before and after the change-point), that is, ‘‘no fault” and ‘‘fault”, and the yielded results are easy to interpret. An\nadditional merit of the proposed approach is its ability to quantify the uncertainty in damage detection. Assume that the observed sequential data can be divided into two non-overlapping partitions, the first of which is regarded as healthy\nof the observations. Thus, the damage detection problem becomes the test of H0 : l ¼ l0 versus H1 : l–l0 with\nWith the above, damage detection can be achieved by means of Bayes factor which is defined as the ratio of the probability of observations given the alternate hypothesis to the probability of observations given the null hypothesiswhere D ¼ yf 1; ; yng refers to the observed data. It is proven to bewhere refers to the mean of the observed data fy1; ; yng. If no prior information is available, the initial mean and variance can be set as q ¼ l0 and s ¼ r 0 [][. The two assumptions take the prior mean and variance in the alternative hypothesis as]where z ¼ pfn **f** i ffi l0 0 [ At each time step (i.e.,][ n][=1), the Bayes factor][ B][ is larger for the larger values of][ z][j j][, which is reasonable]and easy to interpret. The logarithm of the Bayes factor, for convenience of comparison among a larger of values, is derived asIf the Bayes factor B10 is larger than 1, the implication is that the observed data provide evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis H1 (i.e., the structure is damaged). Otherwise, the observed data are judged to support the null hypothesis H0 (i.e.,\nthe structure is healthy). As with the previous threshold, B10 10 is set as a threshold for damage indication.\nIntegrating together the outlier detection, change-point detection and damage assessment, the implementation procedures of the proposed methodology are shown in Fig. 3. Beginning at time t, the single Bayes factor is firstly evaluated to\njudge whether yt is an outlier. If not, the maximum cumulative Bayes factor Lt and run length lt for change-point detection are calculated. Once a change-point is detected, the intervention is carried out by resetting the time to the time of occurrence\n(i.e., TOC = t lt þ 1) and by adjusting the mean value of M0 to the observation yt (i.e., f t ¼ yt), and the subsequent analysis\nwill then be started at TOC. Meanwhile, Bayesian hypothesis testing is executed for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification from the current TOC to the next TOC.4. Application to in-service monitoring data of high-speed trainAn onboard monitoring system has been designed and implemented on an in-service high-speed passenger train running on the Lanzhou-Urumqi High-Speed Railway (LUHSR) in China . As shown in Fig. 4, the monitoring system is composed\nof a total of 52 FBG strain sensors, 4 FBG temperature sensors, 11 accelerometers (tri-axial) and 1 noise sensor deployed on both motor and trailer bogies. Also, one tri-axial FBG accelerometer, one video camera and two GPS sensors are installed inside a train carriage. As the present work is focused on the real-time detection of potentially defective wheels by using strain monitoring data from bogies, only the deployment of strain sensors is concerned. The strain sensors are mounted\non 4 measurement zones of the bogies: (i) the zone with the action of high loads; (ii) the stress transmission zone; (iii)\nthe zone with high responses predicted by finite element analysis; and (iv) welded joints. FBG strain (and temperature) sensors are deployed and attached to the surface of the train bogie with industrial glue and tapes, and connected to the interrogator (data logger) with laptop inside the train carriage through optical fiber cables.\nThe data utilized in this study were obtained from a monitoring schedule spanning 18 days as shown in Table 1. The total length of the LUHSR between Lanzhou and Urumqi is 1777 km. In the trip from Lanzhou to Urumqi, the high-speed train\nstops by 14 stations and travels cross 13 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 13th); in trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou, the high-speed train stops by 15 stations and travels cross 14 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 14th). During the monitoring\nperiod, the train operated at its normal speed around 200–250 km/h. The sampling rate for all the sensors was set at 5000\nSince the train wheels were lathed (lathing is a process to make wheels perfectly rounded) during the monitoring period,\nthe recorded data contain information in line with two different states (before lathing and after lathing). The wheels can be considered as potentially unhealthy (defective) before lathing and as healthy after lathing. To verify the effectiveness of theproposed real-time defect detection methodology, the strain monitoring data obtained from the bogies before and afterThe train’s dynamic responses may be influenced by different subgrade conditions of the railroad, such as ground, tunnel,\nand bridge. To eliminate the effects of different railroad conditions, the strain data recorded from the same railroad sectionbefore and after lathing, are used in each scenario. In addition, the passenger loads in different trips are deemed statistically identical and the speed of train is assumed to be constant as in normal operation. Without loss of generality, the monitoring\ndata respectively obtained from two typical railroad sections (1st and 14th) in the trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou are chosen to illustrate the proposed real-time defect detection methodology, which are from the strain gauge (MS3-7) deployed at the For the sake of brevity, the monitoring data collected from the 1st railroad section are denoted as Case 1, while those from the 14th railroad section are denoted as Case 2. Firstly, the measured strain is converted to stress for the subsequent stress\nrange calculation. For the strain gauges mounted on the steel surface, the conversion of the measured strain to stress is made by rs ¼ Ee, where E is the elasticity modulus of steel and e is the strain after eliminating the effect of varying temperatures.where em is the measured strain, T m is the measured temperature in the vicinity of the strain sensor, T 0 is the temperature at\nthe installation, and a1 is a constant coefficient. In our case, the original temperature is 4, i.e., T 0 ¼ 4. The results of temperature compensation are demonstrated in Fig. 5. It is obvious that the trend in strain responses caused by temperature\nAfterwards, the stress ranges are extracted from the monitoring-derived stress data by the application of the rainflow\ncounting algorithm. From each stress cycle, the stress range Sa is obtained by calculating the difference between the maximum stress rmax and the minimum stress rmin measured in that stress cycle, i.e., Sa ¼ rmax rmin. More details on the stress ranges extraction are given in . The stress ranges with amplitudes lower than 1 MPa need to be culled because the majority are caused by noise. To decrease the uncertainty arising from the measurement facilities, the average stress ranges for\nevery ten minutes are used as the target quantities. Due to the different lengths of the two selected railroad sections (1st and 14th), the traveling time of the train in each section is also different. This results in different data lengths. The data\nlengths of the average stress ranges in Case 1 and Case 2 are 110 and 90, respectively. Figs. and 7 show the original measured strain responses before and after lathing in Case 1 and Case 2, respectively.Following the implementation procedures mentioned before, the defect detection results for Case 1 are demonstrated in\nFigs. and 9. Fig. 8(a) shows the average stress range (red point) together with 1-step ahead prediction (blue solid line) and\nthe corresponding 90% prediction interval (grey shadow). It is observed that, although some observations at the time interval t 2 fall outside the 90% prediction interval, only the Bayes factor at time t ¼ 55 exceeds the established threshold of Hmin ¼ 10 as shown in Fig. 9(a). It is thus judged as an outlier (marked as h). The reason is that because when applying the proposed approach, the shift parameter is set as h ¼ 1:645rt, resulting in the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt while the other\nfour observations are still within the uncertainty limit. On the other hand, Fig. 9(b)–(c) shows the results of the maximum cumulative Bayes factor and the corresponding run length for change detection. It is seen that the maximum cumulative\nBayes factor values at time instants t ¼ 56; 57 and 58 are larger than the threshold of Lmin ¼ 10, while merely the run length at instant t ¼ 58 surpasses the threshold of lmin ¼ 4. Apparently, this observation at time t ¼ 58 fulfills the conditions of change-point detection causing an alarm to be issued (i.e., TON ¼ 58). The identified real occurrence time of change-point is t ¼ 55 (i.e., TOC ¼ 58 4 þ 1 ¼ 55), which coincides well with the actual time point of lathing the wheels. In accordance\nwith the real-time identification of change-point occurrence, the prediction model is refined by altering the guessed mean\nvalue at TOC, as shown in Fig. 8(b). The predictions near TOC in the refined model obviously agree well with the actual observations, thus offering a better prediction performance than that of the original model.\nThe results of defect detection by means of Bayesian hypothesis testing are illustrated in Fig. 9(d). The discrimination between ‘‘healthy” and ‘‘defective” is quantified by the logarithm value of Bayes factor. It is seen from Fig. 9(d) that the vast\nmajority of logarithm values of Bayes factor before TOC are nearly zero and below the threshold level (dotted red line), which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘healthy state” (no defect). This is consistent with the actual health condition and thus validatesthe capability of the Bayesian hypothesis testing. On the contrary, all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than 2, meaning that the corresponding Bayes factor values exceed 100. According to the classification of Bayes factor stipulated in Sub-section 3.1, this result (H > 100) favors the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity is classified as ‘‘decisive”. Indeed, wheels immediately before being sent to depot for lathing were in the state of ‘heavily defective’.\nMaking use of Eq. (21), the probabilities of damage after TOC are obtained as 100%, that is, the wheels are identified as defective with a very high confidence.\nThe defect detection results for Case 2 are similar to Case 1, and are illustrated in Figs. and 11. As seen in Fig. 11(a)–(c)\nno outlier exists throughout the whole period, but a change-point is identified, of which the time of notification is t ¼ 44 (i.e.,\nTON ¼ 44) and the real time of occurrence is t ¼ 41 (i.e., TOC ¼ 44 4 þ 1 ¼ 41). The result matches well with the actual time point when wheel lathing is inflicted. For the predictions near the change-point, the modified prediction model\n(Fig. 10(b)) offers a better performance than the original model (Fig. 10(a)). As illustrated in Fig. 11(d), all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than the threshold (dotted red line), whereas the values before TOC are within thethreshold line. The values of Bayes factor after TOC are obtained to be higher than 100 (H > 100) and the corresponding probabilities of damage are approximately 100%, which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity\nApart from the accuracy of the proposed approach, the computational efficiency is also of concern. The algorithmic implementation is performed on a Lenovo ThinkCentre M720t desktop (Lenovo, Beijing, China) with Dual Intel Core i7-8700 processor (Intel, California, USA) and 24 GB of memory. The computation times consumed in Case 1 and Case 2 are 4.0109 s and\n3.7704 s respectively. In this sense, it realizes the detection of wheel defects in real time.5. ConclusionsA novel methodology for real-time defect detection of high-speed train wheels using Bayesian forecasting and dynamic linear model (DLM) has been developed and validated in this study. First, the DLM is formulated to approximate the actual\nframework. Afterwards, three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) are elicited for outlier detection and change-point detection. After the change-point has been confirmed, damage assessment is executed by the Bayesian hypothesis testing of the sequential observations before and after the change-point. Due to accommodating the dynamic evolution process and the statistical nature of the method, the proposed approach not only possesses the ability of real-time damage detection, but also enables damage quantification (through classifying the range of Bayes factor) and uncertainty assessment (through calculating the probability of damage). The methodology is illustrated by using the onlinelathing). In the two cases addressed, wheel defects are successfully identified, hence validating the effectiveness of the developed method. The quantitative results about the damage extent and confidence would provide useful information helping to\nmake cost-effective, risk-based decisions with the aim of maintaining the operation safety of high-speed rail.\nDespite the proposed methodology being developed for wheel defect detection of high-speed trains, it can also be applied to low-speed passenger and freight trains as well as extended to SHM for a wide variety of civil infrastructure (e.g., bridges,\nbuildings and tunnels) when vibration signals are available via monitoring. In this study, the second-order polynomial DLM\nis employed to model the stress ranges, which only considers the change of stress range level and trend. However, most longterm SHM data, especially long-term strain monitoring data, are generally contaminated by trend, seasonal (cyclical) and\nregression effects, which require a more complex model. The Bayesian DLM enables the modeling of time-dependent responses of a structure by integrating appropriate components, for instance, the response with cyclical characteristics\ncan be depicted by embedding a seasonal (cyclical) component. Thus, in accordance with the nature of monitoring data,\nan appropriate Bayesian DLM enabling to describe time series data of different features, can be formulated for damage detection of a variety of structures subject to different operational/environmental conditions.Administrative Region, China (Project No. PolyU 152024/17E).

IntroductionHigh-speed rail (HSR) is being developed in Asian and European countries to satisfy the rapidly growing demand for intercity services and to shore up economic growth. The rapid\ngrowth of HSR, however, has posed great challenges regarding operation safety, reliability\nand ride comfort. Irregular wheel defects can induce high-magnitude impact forces hindering safety and ride comfort of HSR and may also cause damage to rail tracks and vehicles.real time. The proposed methodology embraces logics for (i) prognosis, (ii) potential outlier\ndetection, (iii) identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and (iv) quantification of damage extent and uncertainty. Relying on the strain monitoring data acquired from high-speed train bogies, the Bayesian DLM for characterizing the actual stress ranges is established, by which one-step forecast distribution is elicited before proceeding to the\nnext observation. The detection of change-point is executed by comparing the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM) and an alternative model\n(the mean value is shifted by a prescribed offset) to determine which better fits the actual observation.

Rail accidents were occasionally caused by failures such as severe defects or fatigue of railway components. To maintain a good service quality and operation safety, it is paramount to develop\nonline monitoring techniques that not only quickly recognize faults of mission-critical HSR components but also can anticipate of long-term mechanisms and gradual deterioration in performance.\nWheelsets in a high-speed train are physically connected with and controlled by the bogie system which corrects alignment for stable running and reduces the vibration caused by wheel-rail interaction . However, the wheel performance\nprogressively deteriorates in different mechanisms (e.g., wheel flat and wheel polygonization) during the routine operation of a high-speed train . Wheel performance deterioration increases stresses experienced by the bogie system. In addition,\nthe increased stress within bogie frames caused by wheel quality deterioration can be unexpectedly large, thus posing a serious threat to the operation safety of concerned trains. According to the statistics of train accidents caused by failure in\nmechanical components during 2004 to 2007 in the United States, the wheelsets faults are the most cause with a rate of\n44.7% . Therefore, the railway managers are keen to keep wheels in an adequate condition and detect potential failure\nas soon as possible. For railway wheels, there are three different ways of estimating the conditions: physical modeling, statistical modeling and condition monitoring . However, the first two ways are not applicable to in-service\nwheel condition assessment, and in contrast, the third way is most feasible for wheel condition estimation. The monitoring approaches available to wheel defect detection can be divided into in-workshop inspection and in-service detection . The\nlatter provides the real-time data required for maintenance planning, while the former is normally carried out at workshops at fixed intervals. The commonly used in-workshop methods for wheel defect inspection include the ultrasonic techniques, infrared camera and magnetic methods . In-service monitoring approaches can be categorized as on-board and wayside methods. The on-board methods implement sensors on the train and continuously obtain comprehensive data from\nthe system. The methods of this category include magnetic technique , ultrasonic technique , acoustic technique, and vibration technique . On the other hand, wayside methods attempt to detect the wheel or vehicle performance\nby installing sensors on the rail or its surrounding areas. Such indirect measurements give rise to limited information of the wheel condition while they can monitor all train wheels going by with using only one or a few sensors. According to the type\nof sensors used, wayside detection approaches include strain sensing technology , fiber optic sensing technology ,\nultrasonic technique , vibration technique , acoustic emission , lasers and high-speed cameras . However,\nthe study on data interpretation techniques enabling the extraction of defect-sensitive features is far from sufficient.\nBayesian dynamic linear model (DLM) is an elegant system approach to handling time series data from a Bayesian perspective, which originates from the field of applied statistics and is extensively used in other fields such as economics\nand engineering [25–30]. The Bayesian DLM treats the time series as the output of a dynamic system perturbed by random disturbances. It is suitable for modeling both univariate and multivariate time series, and also for representing the structural changes, non-stationarity and irregular patterns . Unlike the classical time series method which assumes a fixed relationship between the dependent variables (response variables) and the independent variables (regressors), the DLM considers\nthe relationship changes over time and is able to directly capture time series data features, such as trend, seasonality,\nand regression effects. Moreover, the DLM allows for descriptions of temporary or permanent shifts in time series parameters that occur abruptly, which are necessary for outlier and damage detection in structural health monitoring (SHM) paradigms. Recently, Goulet and his collaborator adopted the Bayesian DLM theory in SHM to model the time-dependent\nresponses of structures by breaking them into subcomponents. In the perspective of real-time damage detection, only few studies are available. The first attempt was conducted by Lipowsky et al. with the development of a Bayesian DLM-based\nreal-time detection algorithm to evaluate the performance of a gas turbine using simulated data. Later on, Wang et al.\nand Zhang et al. adopted the above algorithm for detecting high-speed train defects by using real-world monitoring\ndata. In the previous studies, however, the real-time detection algorithm devised possesses only outlier identification and\nchange detection abilities, without the function of damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.context of Bayesian DLM, which incorporates logics for prognosis, potential outlier detection, identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and damage extent and uncertainty quantification. The Bayesian DLM is considered as a tool\nfor time series analysis, while Bayesian forecasting is executed to enable the calculation of one-step ahead forecast distribution. The change-point detection is performed by checking the current observation against the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM for current instant) as well as against an alternative model of which the mean value\nis shifted by a prescribed offset. The detection rule is that if the alternative model better fits the actual observation, a potential change is signaled. To further determine whether such an observation is only an outlier or the beginning of an actual\nchange (change-point), a specific logic is developed by introducing the Bayes factor and the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.\nThe main contributions of this study are the provision of: (i) a formula which not only enables the modeling of actual framework; (ii) three metrics (i.e., the Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) to allow for outlier\nand change-point detection in real-time manner; and (iii) an efficient way for damage extent assessment and uncertainty\nquantification. The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the Bayesian DLM theory and an elaboration of the Bayesian forecasting philosophy. Section 3 presents the defect detection methodology that incorporates logics for\noutlier detection, change-point identification, and damage assessment. In Section 4, two case studies making use of timeseries strain data acquired by fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors affixed on the bogies of an in-service high-speed train are offered to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the proposed methodology. Finally, conclusions are drawn in2. Bayesian DLM and forecastingThe Bayesian DLM is a kind of process-based Bayesian prediction model which provides a flexible way to intuitively capture how processes evolve over time. It consists of two basic equations: an observation (measurement) equation and a system (evolution) equation . The observation (measurement) equation describes the relationship between the observed\nrandom vectors with mean zero and unknown covariance matrices V t and W t. The DLM defined above amounts to treating ht\nrange level at time t, and at represents the stress range change between time t 1 and t. v t is the zero-mean Gaussian random variable representing the error of measurement at moment t. x1t and x2t are both zero-mean Gaussian random variables representing the evolution of DLM from time t 1 to t. In association with the form of DLM in Equation (1), we haveThe Bayesian forecasting philosophy is based on the description of an observed process using its probability density function (PDF). As implied by the name, the Bayesian forecasting approach commences from Bayes’ theorem, hence enabling the calculation of conditional probabilities. The details of using DLM for the recursive one-step ahead forecasting of the (posterior) distribution of monitoring-derived stress ranges under the Bayesian framework are presented as follows\nNote that in Step 4, Atþ1 is the adaptive coefficient which can be viewed as the information tuner. It scales the correction term according to the relative variances of the prior and likelihood, as measured by Rtþ1=Q tþ1 and regressor value Ftþ1. etþ1 is\nthe one-step forward forecast error, the difference between the observed value ytþ1 and its expectation f tþ1. More details\nabout the recursive one-step ahead forecast method can be found in .3. Defect detection methodologyThe proposed defect detection methodology contains three logical processes: outlier detection, change-point detection,\nand damage assessment. By comparing the real-time measurement with the predicted values, the named outlier detection and change-point detection are devised to determine whether the measurement is a single outlier or the first observation of a remarkable change, the former being executed by calculating the Bayes factor, while the latter being based on the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once a change-point is affirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for further damagePotential outlier detection is the first step in the process of the proposed defect detection approach, accomplished by the Bayes factor calculation. Bayes factor is advocated because of its straightforward and natural interpretation of evidence afforded by data. At every time step t, the Bayesian DLM can yield a PDF for the next measurement, labeled as M0. Meanwhile, an artificial alternative model labeled as M1 is defined by shifting the mean of M0 by +h. The underlying idea of outlier\ndetection is to check the current observation against both M0 and M1. For each time step t, the Bayes factor is the ratio of thewhere yt is the measurement at time t and Dt1 refers to the history information up to time t 1. In the case of Gaussianwhere h is the shift value; yt is the observation value; f t and rt are the mean and standard deviation of the forecasting distribution for observation at time t. A Bayes factor H ¼ 1 indicates that the probability of the observation derived from model M1 is identical to the probability of that derived from Model M0. For better quantitative comparison between any two models, Jeffreys suggested interpreting the Bayes factor as a scale of evidence and provided descriptive statements although\nthe partitions are somewhat arbitrary. According to his suggestion, a Bayes factor can be divided into several intervals for assessing the significance of discrimination: 1 < H < 3 is ‘barely worth mentioning’, 3 < H < 10 is ‘substantial’,\n10 < H < 30 is ‘strong’, 30 < H < 100 is ‘very strong’, and H > 100 is ‘decisive’. In this study, Hmin ¼ 10 is set as a threshold\nAfter the confirmation of Hmin and h, an uncertainty limit (ucl) can be procured by the following equationFor instance, when the confidence level a and threshold of Bayes factor Hmin are set as 90% and 10 respectively, the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt. Thus, an observation is diagnosed as an outlier if its deviation from the mean value of M0 is larger\nWith the Bayes factor defined in Equation (9), only outliers with a positive deviation can be detected. To enable the outliers with negative deviation to be detected as well, a second Bayes factor is defined asIn the automatic monitoring process, both the Bayes factors H1;t and H2;t should be examined in parallel to enable thebehavior, rather than judgments based on long past performances. Change-point is an abrupt variation in time series data,\nrepresenting a transition that occurs between states. Change-point detection aims to detect abrupt change in the generative\nprocess of sequential data. It is assumed that a sequence of observations y1; ; yT could be divided into several nonoverlapping partitions, e.g. dataset j 1, dataset j, and dataset j + 1 as shown in Fig. 2. The delineations between partitions\nare known as change-points (e.g. TOC j 1 and TOC j); the goal of change-point detection is the determination of where the\nboundary of two adjacent partitions is located in a sequence of observations. Change-point detection approaches can be classified into offline and online methods. The former needs to observe the whole sequential observations before aiming to make\ninference on the generative process of the sequence [37–40], wheras the latter aims to update the inference at each time step\nwith the newly acquired measurements from the sequence [41–43]. In particular, the Bayesian online change-point detection methods are based on computing the probability distribution of the run length.differentiate between the single-point outlier and the beginning of a continual change. To overcome this problem, cumulative Bayes factor (local Bayes factors) is recommended to detect change-point(s) in the sequence of observations, by definingwhere lmax is the maximum number of Bayes factors taken into account. Unlike Bayes factor with implicitly no historical influence in the judgement, the consecutive Bayes factors collect evidence of change over a series of observation (from time\net al. . Akin to the Bayes factor threshold for outlier detection, the threshold of maximal cumulative Bayes factors is set as Lmin ¼ 10. If the conditions Lt > Lmin and lt > lmin occur simultaneously, an alarm of change is immediately issued at time t\n(time of notification, TON). The real time of occurrence (TOC) is (t lt þ 1), that is, TOC =t lt þ 1.Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is performed to assess damage extent and quantify the\nassociated uncertainty. The proposed approach directly quantifies the likelihoods of two scenarios (e.g., the sequential observations before and after the change-point), that is, ‘‘no fault” and ‘‘fault”, and the yielded results are easy to interpret. An\nadditional merit of the proposed approach is its ability to quantify the uncertainty in damage detection. Assume that the observed sequential data can be divided into two non-overlapping partitions, the first of which is regarded as healthy\nof the observations. Thus, the damage detection problem becomes the test of H0 : l ¼ l0 versus H1 : l–l0 with\nWith the above, damage detection can be achieved by means of Bayes factor which is defined as the ratio of the probability of observations given the alternate hypothesis to the probability of observations given the null hypothesiswhere D ¼ yf 1; ; yng refers to the observed data. It is proven to bewhere refers to the mean of the observed data fy1; ; yng. If no prior information is available, the initial mean and variance can be set as q ¼ l0 and s ¼ r 0 [][. The two assumptions take the prior mean and variance in the alternative hypothesis as]where z ¼ pfn **f** i ffi l0 0 [ At each time step (i.e.,][ n][=1), the Bayes factor][ B][ is larger for the larger values of][ z][j j][, which is reasonable]and easy to interpret. The logarithm of the Bayes factor, for convenience of comparison among a larger of values, is derived asIf the Bayes factor B10 is larger than 1, the implication is that the observed data provide evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis H1 (i.e., the structure is damaged). Otherwise, the observed data are judged to support the null hypothesis H0 (i.e.,\nthe structure is healthy). As with the previous threshold, B10 10 is set as a threshold for damage indication.\nIntegrating together the outlier detection, change-point detection and damage assessment, the implementation procedures of the proposed methodology are shown in Fig. 3. Beginning at time t, the single Bayes factor is firstly evaluated to\njudge whether yt is an outlier. If not, the maximum cumulative Bayes factor Lt and run length lt for change-point detection are calculated. Once a change-point is detected, the intervention is carried out by resetting the time to the time of occurrence\n(i.e., TOC = t lt þ 1) and by adjusting the mean value of M0 to the observation yt (i.e., f t ¼ yt), and the subsequent analysis\nwill then be started at TOC. Meanwhile, Bayesian hypothesis testing is executed for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification from the current TOC to the next TOC.4. Application to in-service monitoring data of high-speed trainAn onboard monitoring system has been designed and implemented on an in-service high-speed passenger train running on the Lanzhou-Urumqi High-Speed Railway (LUHSR) in China . As shown in Fig. 4, the monitoring system is composed\nof a total of 52 FBG strain sensors, 4 FBG temperature sensors, 11 accelerometers (tri-axial) and 1 noise sensor deployed on both motor and trailer bogies. Also, one tri-axial FBG accelerometer, one video camera and two GPS sensors are installed inside a train carriage. As the present work is focused on the real-time detection of potentially defective wheels by using strain monitoring data from bogies, only the deployment of strain sensors is concerned. The strain sensors are mounted\non 4 measurement zones of the bogies: (i) the zone with the action of high loads; (ii) the stress transmission zone; (iii)\nthe zone with high responses predicted by finite element analysis; and (iv) welded joints. FBG strain (and temperature) sensors are deployed and attached to the surface of the train bogie with industrial glue and tapes, and connected to the interrogator (data logger) with laptop inside the train carriage through optical fiber cables.\nThe data utilized in this study were obtained from a monitoring schedule spanning 18 days as shown in Table 1. The total length of the LUHSR between Lanzhou and Urumqi is 1777 km. In the trip from Lanzhou to Urumqi, the high-speed train\nstops by 14 stations and travels cross 13 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 13th); in trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou, the high-speed train stops by 15 stations and travels cross 14 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 14th). During the monitoring\nperiod, the train operated at its normal speed around 200–250 km/h. The sampling rate for all the sensors was set at 5000\nSince the train wheels were lathed (lathing is a process to make wheels perfectly rounded) during the monitoring period,\nthe recorded data contain information in line with two different states (before lathing and after lathing). The wheels can be considered as potentially unhealthy (defective) before lathing and as healthy after lathing. To verify the effectiveness of theproposed real-time defect detection methodology, the strain monitoring data obtained from the bogies before and afterThe train’s dynamic responses may be influenced by different subgrade conditions of the railroad, such as ground, tunnel,\nand bridge. To eliminate the effects of different railroad conditions, the strain data recorded from the same railroad sectionbefore and after lathing, are used in each scenario. In addition, the passenger loads in different trips are deemed statistically identical and the speed of train is assumed to be constant as in normal operation. Without loss of generality, the monitoring\ndata respectively obtained from two typical railroad sections (1st and 14th) in the trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou are chosen to illustrate the proposed real-time defect detection methodology, which are from the strain gauge (MS3-7) deployed at the For the sake of brevity, the monitoring data collected from the 1st railroad section are denoted as Case 1, while those from the 14th railroad section are denoted as Case 2. Firstly, the measured strain is converted to stress for the subsequent stress\nrange calculation. For the strain gauges mounted on the steel surface, the conversion of the measured strain to stress is made by rs ¼ Ee, where E is the elasticity modulus of steel and e is the strain after eliminating the effect of varying temperatures.where em is the measured strain, T m is the measured temperature in the vicinity of the strain sensor, T 0 is the temperature at\nthe installation, and a1 is a constant coefficient. In our case, the original temperature is 4, i.e., T 0 ¼ 4. The results of temperature compensation are demonstrated in Fig. 5. It is obvious that the trend in strain responses caused by temperature\nAfterwards, the stress ranges are extracted from the monitoring-derived stress data by the application of the rainflow\ncounting algorithm. From each stress cycle, the stress range Sa is obtained by calculating the difference between the maximum stress rmax and the minimum stress rmin measured in that stress cycle, i.e., Sa ¼ rmax rmin. More details on the stress ranges extraction are given in . The stress ranges with amplitudes lower than 1 MPa need to be culled because the majority are caused by noise. To decrease the uncertainty arising from the measurement facilities, the average stress ranges for\nevery ten minutes are used as the target quantities. Due to the different lengths of the two selected railroad sections (1st and 14th), the traveling time of the train in each section is also different. This results in different data lengths. The data\nlengths of the average stress ranges in Case 1 and Case 2 are 110 and 90, respectively. Figs. and 7 show the original measured strain responses before and after lathing in Case 1 and Case 2, respectively.Following the implementation procedures mentioned before, the defect detection results for Case 1 are demonstrated in\nFigs. and 9. Fig. 8(a) shows the average stress range (red point) together with 1-step ahead prediction (blue solid line) and\nthe corresponding 90% prediction interval (grey shadow). It is observed that, although some observations at the time interval t 2 fall outside the 90% prediction interval, only the Bayes factor at time t ¼ 55 exceeds the established threshold of Hmin ¼ 10 as shown in Fig. 9(a). It is thus judged as an outlier (marked as h). The reason is that because when applying the proposed approach, the shift parameter is set as h ¼ 1:645rt, resulting in the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt while the other\nfour observations are still within the uncertainty limit. On the other hand, Fig. 9(b)–(c) shows the results of the maximum cumulative Bayes factor and the corresponding run length for change detection. It is seen that the maximum cumulative\nBayes factor values at time instants t ¼ 56; 57 and 58 are larger than the threshold of Lmin ¼ 10, while merely the run length at instant t ¼ 58 surpasses the threshold of lmin ¼ 4. Apparently, this observation at time t ¼ 58 fulfills the conditions of change-point detection causing an alarm to be issued (i.e., TON ¼ 58). The identified real occurrence time of change-point is t ¼ 55 (i.e., TOC ¼ 58 4 þ 1 ¼ 55), which coincides well with the actual time point of lathing the wheels. In accordance\nwith the real-time identification of change-point occurrence, the prediction model is refined by altering the guessed mean\nvalue at TOC, as shown in Fig. 8(b). The predictions near TOC in the refined model obviously agree well with the actual observations, thus offering a better prediction performance than that of the original model.\nThe results of defect detection by means of Bayesian hypothesis testing are illustrated in Fig. 9(d). The discrimination between ‘‘healthy” and ‘‘defective” is quantified by the logarithm value of Bayes factor. It is seen from Fig. 9(d) that the vast\nmajority of logarithm values of Bayes factor before TOC are nearly zero and below the threshold level (dotted red line), which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘healthy state” (no defect). This is consistent with the actual health condition and thus validatesthe capability of the Bayesian hypothesis testing. On the contrary, all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than 2, meaning that the corresponding Bayes factor values exceed 100. According to the classification of Bayes factor stipulated in Sub-section 3.1, this result (H > 100) favors the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity is classified as ‘‘decisive”. Indeed, wheels immediately before being sent to depot for lathing were in the state of ‘heavily defective’.\nMaking use of Eq. (21), the probabilities of damage after TOC are obtained as 100%, that is, the wheels are identified as defective with a very high confidence.\nThe defect detection results for Case 2 are similar to Case 1, and are illustrated in Figs. and 11. As seen in Fig. 11(a)–(c)\nno outlier exists throughout the whole period, but a change-point is identified, of which the time of notification is t ¼ 44 (i.e.,\nTON ¼ 44) and the real time of occurrence is t ¼ 41 (i.e., TOC ¼ 44 4 þ 1 ¼ 41). The result matches well with the actual time point when wheel lathing is inflicted. For the predictions near the change-point, the modified prediction model\n(Fig. 10(b)) offers a better performance than the original model (Fig. 10(a)). As illustrated in Fig. 11(d), all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than the threshold (dotted red line), whereas the values before TOC are within thethreshold line. The values of Bayes factor after TOC are obtained to be higher than 100 (H > 100) and the corresponding probabilities of damage are approximately 100%, which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity\nApart from the accuracy of the proposed approach, the computational efficiency is also of concern. The algorithmic implementation is performed on a Lenovo ThinkCentre M720t desktop (Lenovo, Beijing, China) with Dual Intel Core i7-8700 processor (Intel, California, USA) and 24 GB of memory. The computation times consumed in Case 1 and Case 2 are 4.0109 s and\n3.7704 s respectively. In this sense, it realizes the detection of wheel defects in real time.5. ConclusionsA novel methodology for real-time defect detection of high-speed train wheels using Bayesian forecasting and dynamic linear model (DLM) has been developed and validated in this study. First, the DLM is formulated to approximate the actual\nframework. Afterwards, three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) are elicited for outlier detection and change-point detection. After the change-point has been confirmed, damage assessment is executed by the Bayesian hypothesis testing of the sequential observations before and after the change-point. Due to accommodating the dynamic evolution process and the statistical nature of the method, the proposed approach not only possesses the ability of real-time damage detection, but also enables damage quantification (through classifying the range of Bayes factor) and uncertainty assessment (through calculating the probability of damage). The methodology is illustrated by using the onlinelathing). In the two cases addressed, wheel defects are successfully identified, hence validating the effectiveness of the developed method. The quantitative results about the damage extent and confidence would provide useful information helping to\nmake cost-effective, risk-based decisions with the aim of maintaining the operation safety of high-speed rail.\nDespite the proposed methodology being developed for wheel defect detection of high-speed trains, it can also be applied to low-speed passenger and freight trains as well as extended to SHM for a wide variety of civil infrastructure (e.g., bridges,\nbuildings and tunnels) when vibration signals are available via monitoring. In this study, the second-order polynomial DLM\nis employed to model the stress ranges, which only considers the change of stress range level and trend. However, most longterm SHM data, especially long-term strain monitoring data, are generally contaminated by trend, seasonal (cyclical) and\nregression effects, which require a more complex model. The Bayesian DLM enables the modeling of time-dependent responses of a structure by integrating appropriate components, for instance, the response with cyclical characteristics\ncan be depicted by embedding a seasonal (cyclical) component. Thus, in accordance with the nature of monitoring data,\nan appropriate Bayesian DLM enabling to describe time series data of different features, can be formulated for damage detection of a variety of structures subject to different operational/environmental conditions.Administrative Region, China (Project No. PolyU 152024/17E).

IntroductionHigh-speed rail (HSR) is being developed in Asian and European countries to satisfy the rapidly growing demand for intercity services and to shore up economic growth. The rapid\ngrowth of HSR, however, has posed great challenges regarding operation safety, reliability\nand ride comfort. Irregular wheel defects can induce high-magnitude impact forces hindering safety and ride comfort of HSR and may also cause damage to rail tracks and vehicles.real time. The proposed methodology embraces logics for (i) prognosis, (ii) potential outlier\ndetection, (iii) identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and (iv) quantification of damage extent and uncertainty. Relying on the strain monitoring data acquired from high-speed train bogies, the Bayesian DLM for characterizing the actual stress ranges is established, by which one-step forecast distribution is elicited before proceeding to the\nnext observation. The detection of change-point is executed by comparing the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM) and an alternative model\n(the mean value is shifted by a prescribed offset) to determine which better fits the actual observation. If the comparison results are in favor of the alternative model, it is claimed that a potential change has occurred. Whether such an observation is an outlier or the beginning of a genuine change (change-point), three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum\ncumulative Bayes factor and run length) are performed for further identification.

Rail accidents were occasionally caused by failures such as severe defects or fatigue of railway components. To maintain a good service quality and operation safety, it is paramount to develop\nonline monitoring techniques that not only quickly recognize faults of mission-critical HSR components but also can anticipate of long-term mechanisms and gradual deterioration in performance.\nWheelsets in a high-speed train are physically connected with and controlled by the bogie system which corrects alignment for stable running and reduces the vibration caused by wheel-rail interaction . However, the wheel performance\nprogressively deteriorates in different mechanisms (e.g., wheel flat and wheel polygonization) during the routine operation of a high-speed train . Wheel performance deterioration increases stresses experienced by the bogie system. In addition,\nthe increased stress within bogie frames caused by wheel quality deterioration can be unexpectedly large, thus posing a serious threat to the operation safety of concerned trains. According to the statistics of train accidents caused by failure in\nmechanical components during 2004 to 2007 in the United States, the wheelsets faults are the most cause with a rate of\n44.7% . Therefore, the railway managers are keen to keep wheels in an adequate condition and detect potential failure\nas soon as possible. For railway wheels, there are three different ways of estimating the conditions: physical modeling, statistical modeling and condition monitoring . However, the first two ways are not applicable to in-service\nwheel condition assessment, and in contrast, the third way is most feasible for wheel condition estimation. The monitoring approaches available to wheel defect detection can be divided into in-workshop inspection and in-service detection . The\nlatter provides the real-time data required for maintenance planning, while the former is normally carried out at workshops at fixed intervals. The commonly used in-workshop methods for wheel defect inspection include the ultrasonic techniques, infrared camera and magnetic methods . In-service monitoring approaches can be categorized as on-board and wayside methods. The on-board methods implement sensors on the train and continuously obtain comprehensive data from\nthe system. The methods of this category include magnetic technique , ultrasonic technique , acoustic technique, and vibration technique . On the other hand, wayside methods attempt to detect the wheel or vehicle performance\nby installing sensors on the rail or its surrounding areas. Such indirect measurements give rise to limited information of the wheel condition while they can monitor all train wheels going by with using only one or a few sensors. According to the type\nof sensors used, wayside detection approaches include strain sensing technology , fiber optic sensing technology ,\nultrasonic technique , vibration technique , acoustic emission , lasers and high-speed cameras . However,\nthe study on data interpretation techniques enabling the extraction of defect-sensitive features is far from sufficient.\nBayesian dynamic linear model (DLM) is an elegant system approach to handling time series data from a Bayesian perspective, which originates from the field of applied statistics and is extensively used in other fields such as economics\nand engineering [25–30]. The Bayesian DLM treats the time series as the output of a dynamic system perturbed by random disturbances. It is suitable for modeling both univariate and multivariate time series, and also for representing the structural changes, non-stationarity and irregular patterns . Unlike the classical time series method which assumes a fixed relationship between the dependent variables (response variables) and the independent variables (regressors), the DLM considers\nthe relationship changes over time and is able to directly capture time series data features, such as trend, seasonality,\nand regression effects. Moreover, the DLM allows for descriptions of temporary or permanent shifts in time series parameters that occur abruptly, which are necessary for outlier and damage detection in structural health monitoring (SHM) paradigms. Recently, Goulet and his collaborator adopted the Bayesian DLM theory in SHM to model the time-dependent\nresponses of structures by breaking them into subcomponents. In the perspective of real-time damage detection, only few studies are available. The first attempt was conducted by Lipowsky et al. with the development of a Bayesian DLM-based\nreal-time detection algorithm to evaluate the performance of a gas turbine using simulated data. Later on, Wang et al.\nand Zhang et al. adopted the above algorithm for detecting high-speed train defects by using real-world monitoring\ndata. In the previous studies, however, the real-time detection algorithm devised possesses only outlier identification and\nchange detection abilities, without the function of damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.context of Bayesian DLM, which incorporates logics for prognosis, potential outlier detection, identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and damage extent and uncertainty quantification. The Bayesian DLM is considered as a tool\nfor time series analysis, while Bayesian forecasting is executed to enable the calculation of one-step ahead forecast distribution. The change-point detection is performed by checking the current observation against the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM for current instant) as well as against an alternative model of which the mean value\nis shifted by a prescribed offset. The detection rule is that if the alternative model better fits the actual observation, a potential change is signaled. To further determine whether such an observation is only an outlier or the beginning of an actual\nchange (change-point), a specific logic is developed by introducing the Bayes factor and the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.\nThe main contributions of this study are the provision of: (i) a formula which not only enables the modeling of actual framework; (ii) three metrics (i.e., the Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) to allow for outlier\nand change-point detection in real-time manner; and (iii) an efficient way for damage extent assessment and uncertainty\nquantification. The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the Bayesian DLM theory and an elaboration of the Bayesian forecasting philosophy. Section 3 presents the defect detection methodology that incorporates logics for\noutlier detection, change-point identification, and damage assessment. In Section 4, two case studies making use of timeseries strain data acquired by fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors affixed on the bogies of an in-service high-speed train are offered to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the proposed methodology. Finally, conclusions are drawn in2. Bayesian DLM and forecastingThe Bayesian DLM is a kind of process-based Bayesian prediction model which provides a flexible way to intuitively capture how processes evolve over time. It consists of two basic equations: an observation (measurement) equation and a system (evolution) equation . The observation (measurement) equation describes the relationship between the observed\nrandom vectors with mean zero and unknown covariance matrices V t and W t. The DLM defined above amounts to treating ht\nrange level at time t, and at represents the stress range change between time t 1 and t. v t is the zero-mean Gaussian random variable representing the error of measurement at moment t. x1t and x2t are both zero-mean Gaussian random variables representing the evolution of DLM from time t 1 to t. In association with the form of DLM in Equation (1), we haveThe Bayesian forecasting philosophy is based on the description of an observed process using its probability density function (PDF). As implied by the name, the Bayesian forecasting approach commences from Bayes’ theorem, hence enabling the calculation of conditional probabilities. The details of using DLM for the recursive one-step ahead forecasting of the (posterior) distribution of monitoring-derived stress ranges under the Bayesian framework are presented as follows\nNote that in Step 4, Atþ1 is the adaptive coefficient which can be viewed as the information tuner. It scales the correction term according to the relative variances of the prior and likelihood, as measured by Rtþ1=Q tþ1 and regressor value Ftþ1. etþ1 is\nthe one-step forward forecast error, the difference between the observed value ytþ1 and its expectation f tþ1. More details\nabout the recursive one-step ahead forecast method can be found in .3. Defect detection methodologyThe proposed defect detection methodology contains three logical processes: outlier detection, change-point detection,\nand damage assessment. By comparing the real-time measurement with the predicted values, the named outlier detection and change-point detection are devised to determine whether the measurement is a single outlier or the first observation of a remarkable change, the former being executed by calculating the Bayes factor, while the latter being based on the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once a change-point is affirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for further damagePotential outlier detection is the first step in the process of the proposed defect detection approach, accomplished by the Bayes factor calculation. Bayes factor is advocated because of its straightforward and natural interpretation of evidence afforded by data. At every time step t, the Bayesian DLM can yield a PDF for the next measurement, labeled as M0. Meanwhile, an artificial alternative model labeled as M1 is defined by shifting the mean of M0 by +h. The underlying idea of outlier\ndetection is to check the current observation against both M0 and M1. For each time step t, the Bayes factor is the ratio of thewhere yt is the measurement at time t and Dt1 refers to the history information up to time t 1. In the case of Gaussianwhere h is the shift value; yt is the observation value; f t and rt are the mean and standard deviation of the forecasting distribution for observation at time t. A Bayes factor H ¼ 1 indicates that the probability of the observation derived from model M1 is identical to the probability of that derived from Model M0. For better quantitative comparison between any two models, Jeffreys suggested interpreting the Bayes factor as a scale of evidence and provided descriptive statements although\nthe partitions are somewhat arbitrary. According to his suggestion, a Bayes factor can be divided into several intervals for assessing the significance of discrimination: 1 < H < 3 is ‘barely worth mentioning’, 3 < H < 10 is ‘substantial’,\n10 < H < 30 is ‘strong’, 30 < H < 100 is ‘very strong’, and H > 100 is ‘decisive’. In this study, Hmin ¼ 10 is set as a threshold\nAfter the confirmation of Hmin and h, an uncertainty limit (ucl) can be procured by the following equationFor instance, when the confidence level a and threshold of Bayes factor Hmin are set as 90% and 10 respectively, the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt. Thus, an observation is diagnosed as an outlier if its deviation from the mean value of M0 is larger\nWith the Bayes factor defined in Equation (9), only outliers with a positive deviation can be detected. To enable the outliers with negative deviation to be detected as well, a second Bayes factor is defined asIn the automatic monitoring process, both the Bayes factors H1;t and H2;t should be examined in parallel to enable thebehavior, rather than judgments based on long past performances. Change-point is an abrupt variation in time series data,\nrepresenting a transition that occurs between states. Change-point detection aims to detect abrupt change in the generative\nprocess of sequential data. It is assumed that a sequence of observations y1; ; yT could be divided into several nonoverlapping partitions, e.g. dataset j 1, dataset j, and dataset j + 1 as shown in Fig. 2. The delineations between partitions\nare known as change-points (e.g. TOC j 1 and TOC j); the goal of change-point detection is the determination of where the\nboundary of two adjacent partitions is located in a sequence of observations. Change-point detection approaches can be classified into offline and online methods. The former needs to observe the whole sequential observations before aiming to make\ninference on the generative process of the sequence [37–40], wheras the latter aims to update the inference at each time step\nwith the newly acquired measurements from the sequence [41–43]. In particular, the Bayesian online change-point detection methods are based on computing the probability distribution of the run length.differentiate between the single-point outlier and the beginning of a continual change. To overcome this problem, cumulative Bayes factor (local Bayes factors) is recommended to detect change-point(s) in the sequence of observations, by definingwhere lmax is the maximum number of Bayes factors taken into account. Unlike Bayes factor with implicitly no historical influence in the judgement, the consecutive Bayes factors collect evidence of change over a series of observation (from time\net al. . Akin to the Bayes factor threshold for outlier detection, the threshold of maximal cumulative Bayes factors is set as Lmin ¼ 10. If the conditions Lt > Lmin and lt > lmin occur simultaneously, an alarm of change is immediately issued at time t\n(time of notification, TON). The real time of occurrence (TOC) is (t lt þ 1), that is, TOC =t lt þ 1.Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is performed to assess damage extent and quantify the\nassociated uncertainty. The proposed approach directly quantifies the likelihoods of two scenarios (e.g., the sequential observations before and after the change-point), that is, ‘‘no fault” and ‘‘fault”, and the yielded results are easy to interpret. An\nadditional merit of the proposed approach is its ability to quantify the uncertainty in damage detection. Assume that the observed sequential data can be divided into two non-overlapping partitions, the first of which is regarded as healthy\nof the observations. Thus, the damage detection problem becomes the test of H0 : l ¼ l0 versus H1 : l–l0 with\nWith the above, damage detection can be achieved by means of Bayes factor which is defined as the ratio of the probability of observations given the alternate hypothesis to the probability of observations given the null hypothesiswhere D ¼ yf 1; ; yng refers to the observed data. It is proven to bewhere refers to the mean of the observed data fy1; ; yng. If no prior information is available, the initial mean and variance can be set as q ¼ l0 and s ¼ r 0 [][. The two assumptions take the prior mean and variance in the alternative hypothesis as]where z ¼ pfn **f** i ffi l0 0 [ At each time step (i.e.,][ n][=1), the Bayes factor][ B][ is larger for the larger values of][ z][j j][, which is reasonable]and easy to interpret. The logarithm of the Bayes factor, for convenience of comparison among a larger of values, is derived asIf the Bayes factor B10 is larger than 1, the implication is that the observed data provide evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis H1 (i.e., the structure is damaged). Otherwise, the observed data are judged to support the null hypothesis H0 (i.e.,\nthe structure is healthy). As with the previous threshold, B10 10 is set as a threshold for damage indication.\nIntegrating together the outlier detection, change-point detection and damage assessment, the implementation procedures of the proposed methodology are shown in Fig. 3. Beginning at time t, the single Bayes factor is firstly evaluated to\njudge whether yt is an outlier. If not, the maximum cumulative Bayes factor Lt and run length lt for change-point detection are calculated. Once a change-point is detected, the intervention is carried out by resetting the time to the time of occurrence\n(i.e., TOC = t lt þ 1) and by adjusting the mean value of M0 to the observation yt (i.e., f t ¼ yt), and the subsequent analysis\nwill then be started at TOC. Meanwhile, Bayesian hypothesis testing is executed for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification from the current TOC to the next TOC.4. Application to in-service monitoring data of high-speed trainAn onboard monitoring system has been designed and implemented on an in-service high-speed passenger train running on the Lanzhou-Urumqi High-Speed Railway (LUHSR) in China . As shown in Fig. 4, the monitoring system is composed\nof a total of 52 FBG strain sensors, 4 FBG temperature sensors, 11 accelerometers (tri-axial) and 1 noise sensor deployed on both motor and trailer bogies. Also, one tri-axial FBG accelerometer, one video camera and two GPS sensors are installed inside a train carriage. As the present work is focused on the real-time detection of potentially defective wheels by using strain monitoring data from bogies, only the deployment of strain sensors is concerned. The strain sensors are mounted\non 4 measurement zones of the bogies: (i) the zone with the action of high loads; (ii) the stress transmission zone; (iii)\nthe zone with high responses predicted by finite element analysis; and (iv) welded joints. FBG strain (and temperature) sensors are deployed and attached to the surface of the train bogie with industrial glue and tapes, and connected to the interrogator (data logger) with laptop inside the train carriage through optical fiber cables.\nThe data utilized in this study were obtained from a monitoring schedule spanning 18 days as shown in Table 1. The total length of the LUHSR between Lanzhou and Urumqi is 1777 km. In the trip from Lanzhou to Urumqi, the high-speed train\nstops by 14 stations and travels cross 13 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 13th); in trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou, the high-speed train stops by 15 stations and travels cross 14 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 14th). During the monitoring\nperiod, the train operated at its normal speed around 200–250 km/h. The sampling rate for all the sensors was set at 5000\nSince the train wheels were lathed (lathing is a process to make wheels perfectly rounded) during the monitoring period,\nthe recorded data contain information in line with two different states (before lathing and after lathing). The wheels can be considered as potentially unhealthy (defective) before lathing and as healthy after lathing. To verify the effectiveness of theproposed real-time defect detection methodology, the strain monitoring data obtained from the bogies before and afterThe train’s dynamic responses may be influenced by different subgrade conditions of the railroad, such as ground, tunnel,\nand bridge. To eliminate the effects of different railroad conditions, the strain data recorded from the same railroad sectionbefore and after lathing, are used in each scenario. In addition, the passenger loads in different trips are deemed statistically identical and the speed of train is assumed to be constant as in normal operation. Without loss of generality, the monitoring\ndata respectively obtained from two typical railroad sections (1st and 14th) in the trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou are chosen to illustrate the proposed real-time defect detection methodology, which are from the strain gauge (MS3-7) deployed at the For the sake of brevity, the monitoring data collected from the 1st railroad section are denoted as Case 1, while those from the 14th railroad section are denoted as Case 2. Firstly, the measured strain is converted to stress for the subsequent stress\nrange calculation. For the strain gauges mounted on the steel surface, the conversion of the measured strain to stress is made by rs ¼ Ee, where E is the elasticity modulus of steel and e is the strain after eliminating the effect of varying temperatures.where em is the measured strain, T m is the measured temperature in the vicinity of the strain sensor, T 0 is the temperature at\nthe installation, and a1 is a constant coefficient. In our case, the original temperature is 4, i.e., T 0 ¼ 4. The results of temperature compensation are demonstrated in Fig. 5. It is obvious that the trend in strain responses caused by temperature\nAfterwards, the stress ranges are extracted from the monitoring-derived stress data by the application of the rainflow\ncounting algorithm. From each stress cycle, the stress range Sa is obtained by calculating the difference between the maximum stress rmax and the minimum stress rmin measured in that stress cycle, i.e., Sa ¼ rmax rmin. More details on the stress ranges extraction are given in . The stress ranges with amplitudes lower than 1 MPa need to be culled because the majority are caused by noise. To decrease the uncertainty arising from the measurement facilities, the average stress ranges for\nevery ten minutes are used as the target quantities. Due to the different lengths of the two selected railroad sections (1st and 14th), the traveling time of the train in each section is also different. This results in different data lengths. The data\nlengths of the average stress ranges in Case 1 and Case 2 are 110 and 90, respectively. Figs. and 7 show the original measured strain responses before and after lathing in Case 1 and Case 2, respectively.Following the implementation procedures mentioned before, the defect detection results for Case 1 are demonstrated in\nFigs. and 9. Fig. 8(a) shows the average stress range (red point) together with 1-step ahead prediction (blue solid line) and\nthe corresponding 90% prediction interval (grey shadow). It is observed that, although some observations at the time interval t 2 fall outside the 90% prediction interval, only the Bayes factor at time t ¼ 55 exceeds the established threshold of Hmin ¼ 10 as shown in Fig. 9(a). It is thus judged as an outlier (marked as h). The reason is that because when applying the proposed approach, the shift parameter is set as h ¼ 1:645rt, resulting in the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt while the other\nfour observations are still within the uncertainty limit. On the other hand, Fig. 9(b)–(c) shows the results of the maximum cumulative Bayes factor and the corresponding run length for change detection. It is seen that the maximum cumulative\nBayes factor values at time instants t ¼ 56; 57 and 58 are larger than the threshold of Lmin ¼ 10, while merely the run length at instant t ¼ 58 surpasses the threshold of lmin ¼ 4. Apparently, this observation at time t ¼ 58 fulfills the conditions of change-point detection causing an alarm to be issued (i.e., TON ¼ 58). The identified real occurrence time of change-point is t ¼ 55 (i.e., TOC ¼ 58 4 þ 1 ¼ 55), which coincides well with the actual time point of lathing the wheels. In accordance\nwith the real-time identification of change-point occurrence, the prediction model is refined by altering the guessed mean\nvalue at TOC, as shown in Fig. 8(b). The predictions near TOC in the refined model obviously agree well with the actual observations, thus offering a better prediction performance than that of the original model.\nThe results of defect detection by means of Bayesian hypothesis testing are illustrated in Fig. 9(d). The discrimination between ‘‘healthy” and ‘‘defective” is quantified by the logarithm value of Bayes factor. It is seen from Fig. 9(d) that the vast\nmajority of logarithm values of Bayes factor before TOC are nearly zero and below the threshold level (dotted red line), which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘healthy state” (no defect). This is consistent with the actual health condition and thus validatesthe capability of the Bayesian hypothesis testing. On the contrary, all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than 2, meaning that the corresponding Bayes factor values exceed 100. According to the classification of Bayes factor stipulated in Sub-section 3.1, this result (H > 100) favors the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity is classified as ‘‘decisive”. Indeed, wheels immediately before being sent to depot for lathing were in the state of ‘heavily defective’.\nMaking use of Eq. (21), the probabilities of damage after TOC are obtained as 100%, that is, the wheels are identified as defective with a very high confidence.\nThe defect detection results for Case 2 are similar to Case 1, and are illustrated in Figs. and 11. As seen in Fig. 11(a)–(c)\nno outlier exists throughout the whole period, but a change-point is identified, of which the time of notification is t ¼ 44 (i.e.,\nTON ¼ 44) and the real time of occurrence is t ¼ 41 (i.e., TOC ¼ 44 4 þ 1 ¼ 41). The result matches well with the actual time point when wheel lathing is inflicted. For the predictions near the change-point, the modified prediction model\n(Fig. 10(b)) offers a better performance than the original model (Fig. 10(a)). As illustrated in Fig. 11(d), all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than the threshold (dotted red line), whereas the values before TOC are within thethreshold line. The values of Bayes factor after TOC are obtained to be higher than 100 (H > 100) and the corresponding probabilities of damage are approximately 100%, which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity\nApart from the accuracy of the proposed approach, the computational efficiency is also of concern. The algorithmic implementation is performed on a Lenovo ThinkCentre M720t desktop (Lenovo, Beijing, China) with Dual Intel Core i7-8700 processor (Intel, California, USA) and 24 GB of memory. The computation times consumed in Case 1 and Case 2 are 4.0109 s and\n3.7704 s respectively. In this sense, it realizes the detection of wheel defects in real time.5. ConclusionsA novel methodology for real-time defect detection of high-speed train wheels using Bayesian forecasting and dynamic linear model (DLM) has been developed and validated in this study. First, the DLM is formulated to approximate the actual\nframework. Afterwards, three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) are elicited for outlier detection and change-point detection. After the change-point has been confirmed, damage assessment is executed by the Bayesian hypothesis testing of the sequential observations before and after the change-point. Due to accommodating the dynamic evolution process and the statistical nature of the method, the proposed approach not only possesses the ability of real-time damage detection, but also enables damage quantification (through classifying the range of Bayes factor) and uncertainty assessment (through calculating the probability of damage). The methodology is illustrated by using the onlinelathing). In the two cases addressed, wheel defects are successfully identified, hence validating the effectiveness of the developed method. The quantitative results about the damage extent and confidence would provide useful information helping to\nmake cost-effective, risk-based decisions with the aim of maintaining the operation safety of high-speed rail.\nDespite the proposed methodology being developed for wheel defect detection of high-speed trains, it can also be applied to low-speed passenger and freight trains as well as extended to SHM for a wide variety of civil infrastructure (e.g., bridges,\nbuildings and tunnels) when vibration signals are available via monitoring. In this study, the second-order polynomial DLM\nis employed to model the stress ranges, which only considers the change of stress range level and trend. However, most longterm SHM data, especially long-term strain monitoring data, are generally contaminated by trend, seasonal (cyclical) and\nregression effects, which require a more complex model. The Bayesian DLM enables the modeling of time-dependent responses of a structure by integrating appropriate components, for instance, the response with cyclical characteristics\ncan be depicted by embedding a seasonal (cyclical) component. Thus, in accordance with the nature of monitoring data,\nan appropriate Bayesian DLM enabling to describe time series data of different features, can be formulated for damage detection of a variety of structures subject to different operational/environmental conditions.Administrative Region, China (Project No. PolyU 152024/17E).

IntroductionHigh-speed rail (HSR) is being developed in Asian and European countries to satisfy the rapidly growing demand for intercity services and to shore up economic growth. The rapid\ngrowth of HSR, however, has posed great challenges regarding operation safety, reliability\nand ride comfort. Irregular wheel defects can induce high-magnitude impact forces hindering safety and ride comfort of HSR and may also cause damage to rail tracks and vehicles.real time. The proposed methodology embraces logics for (i) prognosis, (ii) potential outlier\ndetection, (iii) identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and (iv) quantification of damage extent and uncertainty. Relying on the strain monitoring data acquired from high-speed train bogies, the Bayesian DLM for characterizing the actual stress ranges is established, by which one-step forecast distribution is elicited before proceeding to the\nnext observation. The detection of change-point is executed by comparing the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM) and an alternative model\n(the mean value is shifted by a prescribed offset) to determine which better fits the actual observation. If the comparison results are in favor of the alternative model, it is claimed that a potential change has occurred. Whether such an observation is an outlier or the beginning of a genuine change (change-point), three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum\ncumulative Bayes factor and run length) are performed for further identification. Once a change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for the purpose of\ndamage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification. A severe change, if identified,\ndefects.

Rail accidents were occasionally caused by failures such as severe defects or fatigue of railway components. To maintain a good service quality and operation safety, it is paramount to develop\nonline monitoring techniques that not only quickly recognize faults of mission-critical HSR components but also can anticipate of long-term mechanisms and gradual deterioration in performance.\nWheelsets in a high-speed train are physically connected with and controlled by the bogie system which corrects alignment for stable running and reduces the vibration caused by wheel-rail interaction . However, the wheel performance\nprogressively deteriorates in different mechanisms (e.g., wheel flat and wheel polygonization) during the routine operation of a high-speed train . Wheel performance deterioration increases stresses experienced by the bogie system. In addition,\nthe increased stress within bogie frames caused by wheel quality deterioration can be unexpectedly large, thus posing a serious threat to the operation safety of concerned trains. According to the statistics of train accidents caused by failure in\nmechanical components during 2004 to 2007 in the United States, the wheelsets faults are the most cause with a rate of\n44.7% . Therefore, the railway managers are keen to keep wheels in an adequate condition and detect potential failure\nas soon as possible. For railway wheels, there are three different ways of estimating the conditions: physical modeling, statistical modeling and condition monitoring . However, the first two ways are not applicable to in-service\nwheel condition assessment, and in contrast, the third way is most feasible for wheel condition estimation. The monitoring approaches available to wheel defect detection can be divided into in-workshop inspection and in-service detection . The\nlatter provides the real-time data required for maintenance planning, while the former is normally carried out at workshops at fixed intervals. The commonly used in-workshop methods for wheel defect inspection include the ultrasonic techniques, infrared camera and magnetic methods . In-service monitoring approaches can be categorized as on-board and wayside methods. The on-board methods implement sensors on the train and continuously obtain comprehensive data from\nthe system. The methods of this category include magnetic technique , ultrasonic technique , acoustic technique, and vibration technique . On the other hand, wayside methods attempt to detect the wheel or vehicle performance\nby installing sensors on the rail or its surrounding areas. Such indirect measurements give rise to limited information of the wheel condition while they can monitor all train wheels going by with using only one or a few sensors. According to the type\nof sensors used, wayside detection approaches include strain sensing technology , fiber optic sensing technology ,\nultrasonic technique , vibration technique , acoustic emission , lasers and high-speed cameras . However,\nthe study on data interpretation techniques enabling the extraction of defect-sensitive features is far from sufficient.\nBayesian dynamic linear model (DLM) is an elegant system approach to handling time series data from a Bayesian perspective, which originates from the field of applied statistics and is extensively used in other fields such as economics\nand engineering [25–30]. The Bayesian DLM treats the time series as the output of a dynamic system perturbed by random disturbances. It is suitable for modeling both univariate and multivariate time series, and also for representing the structural changes, non-stationarity and irregular patterns . Unlike the classical time series method which assumes a fixed relationship between the dependent variables (response variables) and the independent variables (regressors), the DLM considers\nthe relationship changes over time and is able to directly capture time series data features, such as trend, seasonality,\nand regression effects. Moreover, the DLM allows for descriptions of temporary or permanent shifts in time series parameters that occur abruptly, which are necessary for outlier and damage detection in structural health monitoring (SHM) paradigms. Recently, Goulet and his collaborator adopted the Bayesian DLM theory in SHM to model the time-dependent\nresponses of structures by breaking them into subcomponents. In the perspective of real-time damage detection, only few studies are available. The first attempt was conducted by Lipowsky et al. with the development of a Bayesian DLM-based\nreal-time detection algorithm to evaluate the performance of a gas turbine using simulated data. Later on, Wang et al.\nand Zhang et al. adopted the above algorithm for detecting high-speed train defects by using real-world monitoring\ndata. In the previous studies, however, the real-time detection algorithm devised possesses only outlier identification and\nchange detection abilities, without the function of damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.context of Bayesian DLM, which incorporates logics for prognosis, potential outlier detection, identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and damage extent and uncertainty quantification. The Bayesian DLM is considered as a tool\nfor time series analysis, while Bayesian forecasting is executed to enable the calculation of one-step ahead forecast distribution. The change-point detection is performed by checking the current observation against the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM for current instant) as well as against an alternative model of which the mean value\nis shifted by a prescribed offset. The detection rule is that if the alternative model better fits the actual observation, a potential change is signaled. To further determine whether such an observation is only an outlier or the beginning of an actual\nchange (change-point), a specific logic is developed by introducing the Bayes factor and the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.\nThe main contributions of this study are the provision of: (i) a formula which not only enables the modeling of actual framework; (ii) three metrics (i.e., the Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) to allow for outlier\nand change-point detection in real-time manner; and (iii) an efficient way for damage extent assessment and uncertainty\nquantification. The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the Bayesian DLM theory and an elaboration of the Bayesian forecasting philosophy. Section 3 presents the defect detection methodology that incorporates logics for\noutlier detection, change-point identification, and damage assessment. In Section 4, two case studies making use of timeseries strain data acquired by fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors affixed on the bogies of an in-service high-speed train are offered to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the proposed methodology. Finally, conclusions are drawn in2. Bayesian DLM and forecastingThe Bayesian DLM is a kind of process-based Bayesian prediction model which provides a flexible way to intuitively capture how processes evolve over time. It consists of two basic equations: an observation (measurement) equation and a system (evolution) equation . The observation (measurement) equation describes the relationship between the observed\nrandom vectors with mean zero and unknown covariance matrices V t and W t. The DLM defined above amounts to treating ht\nrange level at time t, and at represents the stress range change between time t 1 and t. v t is the zero-mean Gaussian random variable representing the error of measurement at moment t. x1t and x2t are both zero-mean Gaussian random variables representing the evolution of DLM from time t 1 to t. In association with the form of DLM in Equation (1), we haveThe Bayesian forecasting philosophy is based on the description of an observed process using its probability density function (PDF). As implied by the name, the Bayesian forecasting approach commences from Bayes’ theorem, hence enabling the calculation of conditional probabilities. The details of using DLM for the recursive one-step ahead forecasting of the (posterior) distribution of monitoring-derived stress ranges under the Bayesian framework are presented as follows\nNote that in Step 4, Atþ1 is the adaptive coefficient which can be viewed as the information tuner. It scales the correction term according to the relative variances of the prior and likelihood, as measured by Rtþ1=Q tþ1 and regressor value Ftþ1. etþ1 is\nthe one-step forward forecast error, the difference between the observed value ytþ1 and its expectation f tþ1. More details\nabout the recursive one-step ahead forecast method can be found in .3. Defect detection methodologyThe proposed defect detection methodology contains three logical processes: outlier detection, change-point detection,\nand damage assessment. By comparing the real-time measurement with the predicted values, the named outlier detection and change-point detection are devised to determine whether the measurement is a single outlier or the first observation of a remarkable change, the former being executed by calculating the Bayes factor, while the latter being based on the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once a change-point is affirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for further damagePotential outlier detection is the first step in the process of the proposed defect detection approach, accomplished by the Bayes factor calculation. Bayes factor is advocated because of its straightforward and natural interpretation of evidence afforded by data. At every time step t, the Bayesian DLM can yield a PDF for the next measurement, labeled as M0. Meanwhile, an artificial alternative model labeled as M1 is defined by shifting the mean of M0 by +h. The underlying idea of outlier\ndetection is to check the current observation against both M0 and M1. For each time step t, the Bayes factor is the ratio of thewhere yt is the measurement at time t and Dt1 refers to the history information up to time t 1. In the case of Gaussianwhere h is the shift value; yt is the observation value; f t and rt are the mean and standard deviation of the forecasting distribution for observation at time t. A Bayes factor H ¼ 1 indicates that the probability of the observation derived from model M1 is identical to the probability of that derived from Model M0. For better quantitative comparison between any two models, Jeffreys suggested interpreting the Bayes factor as a scale of evidence and provided descriptive statements although\nthe partitions are somewhat arbitrary. According to his suggestion, a Bayes factor can be divided into several intervals for assessing the significance of discrimination: 1 < H < 3 is ‘barely worth mentioning’, 3 < H < 10 is ‘substantial’,\n10 < H < 30 is ‘strong’, 30 < H < 100 is ‘very strong’, and H > 100 is ‘decisive’. In this study, Hmin ¼ 10 is set as a threshold\nAfter the confirmation of Hmin and h, an uncertainty limit (ucl) can be procured by the following equationFor instance, when the confidence level a and threshold of Bayes factor Hmin are set as 90% and 10 respectively, the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt. Thus, an observation is diagnosed as an outlier if its deviation from the mean value of M0 is larger\nWith the Bayes factor defined in Equation (9), only outliers with a positive deviation can be detected. To enable the outliers with negative deviation to be detected as well, a second Bayes factor is defined asIn the automatic monitoring process, both the Bayes factors H1;t and H2;t should be examined in parallel to enable thebehavior, rather than judgments based on long past performances. Change-point is an abrupt variation in time series data,\nrepresenting a transition that occurs between states. Change-point detection aims to detect abrupt change in the generative\nprocess of sequential data. It is assumed that a sequence of observations y1; ; yT could be divided into several nonoverlapping partitions, e.g. dataset j 1, dataset j, and dataset j + 1 as shown in Fig. 2. The delineations between partitions\nare known as change-points (e.g. TOC j 1 and TOC j); the goal of change-point detection is the determination of where the\nboundary of two adjacent partitions is located in a sequence of observations. Change-point detection approaches can be classified into offline and online methods. The former needs to observe the whole sequential observations before aiming to make\ninference on the generative process of the sequence [37–40], wheras the latter aims to update the inference at each time step\nwith the newly acquired measurements from the sequence [41–43]. In particular, the Bayesian online change-point detection methods are based on computing the probability distribution of the run length.differentiate between the single-point outlier and the beginning of a continual change. To overcome this problem, cumulative Bayes factor (local Bayes factors) is recommended to detect change-point(s) in the sequence of observations, by definingwhere lmax is the maximum number of Bayes factors taken into account. Unlike Bayes factor with implicitly no historical influence in the judgement, the consecutive Bayes factors collect evidence of change over a series of observation (from time\net al. . Akin to the Bayes factor threshold for outlier detection, the threshold of maximal cumulative Bayes factors is set as Lmin ¼ 10. If the conditions Lt > Lmin and lt > lmin occur simultaneously, an alarm of change is immediately issued at time t\n(time of notification, TON). The real time of occurrence (TOC) is (t lt þ 1), that is, TOC =t lt þ 1.Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is performed to assess damage extent and quantify the\nassociated uncertainty. The proposed approach directly quantifies the likelihoods of two scenarios (e.g., the sequential observations before and after the change-point), that is, ‘‘no fault” and ‘‘fault”, and the yielded results are easy to interpret. An\nadditional merit of the proposed approach is its ability to quantify the uncertainty in damage detection. Assume that the observed sequential data can be divided into two non-overlapping partitions, the first of which is regarded as healthy\nof the observations. Thus, the damage detection problem becomes the test of H0 : l ¼ l0 versus H1 : l–l0 with\nWith the above, damage detection can be achieved by means of Bayes factor which is defined as the ratio of the probability of observations given the alternate hypothesis to the probability of observations given the null hypothesiswhere D ¼ yf 1; ; yng refers to the observed data. It is proven to bewhere refers to the mean of the observed data fy1; ; yng. If no prior information is available, the initial mean and variance can be set as q ¼ l0 and s ¼ r 0 [][. The two assumptions take the prior mean and variance in the alternative hypothesis as]where z ¼ pfn **f** i ffi l0 0 [ At each time step (i.e.,][ n][=1), the Bayes factor][ B][ is larger for the larger values of][ z][j j][, which is reasonable]and easy to interpret. The logarithm of the Bayes factor, for convenience of comparison among a larger of values, is derived asIf the Bayes factor B10 is larger than 1, the implication is that the observed data provide evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis H1 (i.e., the structure is damaged). Otherwise, the observed data are judged to support the null hypothesis H0 (i.e.,\nthe structure is healthy). As with the previous threshold, B10 10 is set as a threshold for damage indication.\nIntegrating together the outlier detection, change-point detection and damage assessment, the implementation procedures of the proposed methodology are shown in Fig. 3. Beginning at time t, the single Bayes factor is firstly evaluated to\njudge whether yt is an outlier. If not, the maximum cumulative Bayes factor Lt and run length lt for change-point detection are calculated. Once a change-point is detected, the intervention is carried out by resetting the time to the time of occurrence\n(i.e., TOC = t lt þ 1) and by adjusting the mean value of M0 to the observation yt (i.e., f t ¼ yt), and the subsequent analysis\nwill then be started at TOC. Meanwhile, Bayesian hypothesis testing is executed for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification from the current TOC to the next TOC.4. Application to in-service monitoring data of high-speed trainAn onboard monitoring system has been designed and implemented on an in-service high-speed passenger train running on the Lanzhou-Urumqi High-Speed Railway (LUHSR) in China . As shown in Fig. 4, the monitoring system is composed\nof a total of 52 FBG strain sensors, 4 FBG temperature sensors, 11 accelerometers (tri-axial) and 1 noise sensor deployed on both motor and trailer bogies. Also, one tri-axial FBG accelerometer, one video camera and two GPS sensors are installed inside a train carriage. As the present work is focused on the real-time detection of potentially defective wheels by using strain monitoring data from bogies, only the deployment of strain sensors is concerned. The strain sensors are mounted\non 4 measurement zones of the bogies: (i) the zone with the action of high loads; (ii) the stress transmission zone; (iii)\nthe zone with high responses predicted by finite element analysis; and (iv) welded joints. FBG strain (and temperature) sensors are deployed and attached to the surface of the train bogie with industrial glue and tapes, and connected to the interrogator (data logger) with laptop inside the train carriage through optical fiber cables.\nThe data utilized in this study were obtained from a monitoring schedule spanning 18 days as shown in Table 1. The total length of the LUHSR between Lanzhou and Urumqi is 1777 km. In the trip from Lanzhou to Urumqi, the high-speed train\nstops by 14 stations and travels cross 13 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 13th); in trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou, the high-speed train stops by 15 stations and travels cross 14 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 14th). During the monitoring\nperiod, the train operated at its normal speed around 200–250 km/h. The sampling rate for all the sensors was set at 5000\nSince the train wheels were lathed (lathing is a process to make wheels perfectly rounded) during the monitoring period,\nthe recorded data contain information in line with two different states (before lathing and after lathing). The wheels can be considered as potentially unhealthy (defective) before lathing and as healthy after lathing. To verify the effectiveness of theproposed real-time defect detection methodology, the strain monitoring data obtained from the bogies before and afterThe train’s dynamic responses may be influenced by different subgrade conditions of the railroad, such as ground, tunnel,\nand bridge. To eliminate the effects of different railroad conditions, the strain data recorded from the same railroad sectionbefore and after lathing, are used in each scenario. In addition, the passenger loads in different trips are deemed statistically identical and the speed of train is assumed to be constant as in normal operation. Without loss of generality, the monitoring\ndata respectively obtained from two typical railroad sections (1st and 14th) in the trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou are chosen to illustrate the proposed real-time defect detection methodology, which are from the strain gauge (MS3-7) deployed at the For the sake of brevity, the monitoring data collected from the 1st railroad section are denoted as Case 1, while those from the 14th railroad section are denoted as Case 2. Firstly, the measured strain is converted to stress for the subsequent stress\nrange calculation. For the strain gauges mounted on the steel surface, the conversion of the measured strain to stress is made by rs ¼ Ee, where E is the elasticity modulus of steel and e is the strain after eliminating the effect of varying temperatures.where em is the measured strain, T m is the measured temperature in the vicinity of the strain sensor, T 0 is the temperature at\nthe installation, and a1 is a constant coefficient. In our case, the original temperature is 4, i.e., T 0 ¼ 4. The results of temperature compensation are demonstrated in Fig. 5. It is obvious that the trend in strain responses caused by temperature\nAfterwards, the stress ranges are extracted from the monitoring-derived stress data by the application of the rainflow\ncounting algorithm. From each stress cycle, the stress range Sa is obtained by calculating the difference between the maximum stress rmax and the minimum stress rmin measured in that stress cycle, i.e., Sa ¼ rmax rmin. More details on the stress ranges extraction are given in . The stress ranges with amplitudes lower than 1 MPa need to be culled because the majority are caused by noise. To decrease the uncertainty arising from the measurement facilities, the average stress ranges for\nevery ten minutes are used as the target quantities. Due to the different lengths of the two selected railroad sections (1st and 14th), the traveling time of the train in each section is also different. This results in different data lengths. The data\nlengths of the average stress ranges in Case 1 and Case 2 are 110 and 90, respectively. Figs. and 7 show the original measured strain responses before and after lathing in Case 1 and Case 2, respectively.Following the implementation procedures mentioned before, the defect detection results for Case 1 are demonstrated in\nFigs. and 9. Fig. 8(a) shows the average stress range (red point) together with 1-step ahead prediction (blue solid line) and\nthe corresponding 90% prediction interval (grey shadow). It is observed that, although some observations at the time interval t 2 fall outside the 90% prediction interval, only the Bayes factor at time t ¼ 55 exceeds the established threshold of Hmin ¼ 10 as shown in Fig. 9(a). It is thus judged as an outlier (marked as h). The reason is that because when applying the proposed approach, the shift parameter is set as h ¼ 1:645rt, resulting in the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt while the other\nfour observations are still within the uncertainty limit. On the other hand, Fig. 9(b)–(c) shows the results of the maximum cumulative Bayes factor and the corresponding run length for change detection. It is seen that the maximum cumulative\nBayes factor values at time instants t ¼ 56; 57 and 58 are larger than the threshold of Lmin ¼ 10, while merely the run length at instant t ¼ 58 surpasses the threshold of lmin ¼ 4. Apparently, this observation at time t ¼ 58 fulfills the conditions of change-point detection causing an alarm to be issued (i.e., TON ¼ 58). The identified real occurrence time of change-point is t ¼ 55 (i.e., TOC ¼ 58 4 þ 1 ¼ 55), which coincides well with the actual time point of lathing the wheels. In accordance\nwith the real-time identification of change-point occurrence, the prediction model is refined by altering the guessed mean\nvalue at TOC, as shown in Fig. 8(b). The predictions near TOC in the refined model obviously agree well with the actual observations, thus offering a better prediction performance than that of the original model.\nThe results of defect detection by means of Bayesian hypothesis testing are illustrated in Fig. 9(d). The discrimination between ‘‘healthy” and ‘‘defective” is quantified by the logarithm value of Bayes factor. It is seen from Fig. 9(d) that the vast\nmajority of logarithm values of Bayes factor before TOC are nearly zero and below the threshold level (dotted red line), which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘healthy state” (no defect). This is consistent with the actual health condition and thus validatesthe capability of the Bayesian hypothesis testing. On the contrary, all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than 2, meaning that the corresponding Bayes factor values exceed 100. According to the classification of Bayes factor stipulated in Sub-section 3.1, this result (H > 100) favors the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity is classified as ‘‘decisive”. Indeed, wheels immediately before being sent to depot for lathing were in the state of ‘heavily defective’.\nMaking use of Eq. (21), the probabilities of damage after TOC are obtained as 100%, that is, the wheels are identified as defective with a very high confidence.\nThe defect detection results for Case 2 are similar to Case 1, and are illustrated in Figs. and 11. As seen in Fig. 11(a)–(c)\nno outlier exists throughout the whole period, but a change-point is identified, of which the time of notification is t ¼ 44 (i.e.,\nTON ¼ 44) and the real time of occurrence is t ¼ 41 (i.e., TOC ¼ 44 4 þ 1 ¼ 41). The result matches well with the actual time point when wheel lathing is inflicted. For the predictions near the change-point, the modified prediction model\n(Fig. 10(b)) offers a better performance than the original model (Fig. 10(a)). As illustrated in Fig. 11(d), all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than the threshold (dotted red line), whereas the values before TOC are within thethreshold line. The values of Bayes factor after TOC are obtained to be higher than 100 (H > 100) and the corresponding probabilities of damage are approximately 100%, which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity\nApart from the accuracy of the proposed approach, the computational efficiency is also of concern. The algorithmic implementation is performed on a Lenovo ThinkCentre M720t desktop (Lenovo, Beijing, China) with Dual Intel Core i7-8700 processor (Intel, California, USA) and 24 GB of memory. The computation times consumed in Case 1 and Case 2 are 4.0109 s and\n3.7704 s respectively. In this sense, it realizes the detection of wheel defects in real time.5. ConclusionsA novel methodology for real-time defect detection of high-speed train wheels using Bayesian forecasting and dynamic linear model (DLM) has been developed and validated in this study. First, the DLM is formulated to approximate the actual\nframework. Afterwards, three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) are elicited for outlier detection and change-point detection. After the change-point has been confirmed, damage assessment is executed by the Bayesian hypothesis testing of the sequential observations before and after the change-point. Due to accommodating the dynamic evolution process and the statistical nature of the method, the proposed approach not only possesses the ability of real-time damage detection, but also enables damage quantification (through classifying the range of Bayes factor) and uncertainty assessment (through calculating the probability of damage). The methodology is illustrated by using the onlinelathing). In the two cases addressed, wheel defects are successfully identified, hence validating the effectiveness of the developed method. The quantitative results about the damage extent and confidence would provide useful information helping to\nmake cost-effective, risk-based decisions with the aim of maintaining the operation safety of high-speed rail.\nDespite the proposed methodology being developed for wheel defect detection of high-speed trains, it can also be applied to low-speed passenger and freight trains as well as extended to SHM for a wide variety of civil infrastructure (e.g., bridges,\nbuildings and tunnels) when vibration signals are available via monitoring. In this study, the second-order polynomial DLM\nis employed to model the stress ranges, which only considers the change of stress range level and trend. However, most longterm SHM data, especially long-term strain monitoring data, are generally contaminated by trend, seasonal (cyclical) and\nregression effects, which require a more complex model. The Bayesian DLM enables the modeling of time-dependent responses of a structure by integrating appropriate components, for instance, the response with cyclical characteristics\ncan be depicted by embedding a seasonal (cyclical) component. Thus, in accordance with the nature of monitoring data,\nan appropriate Bayesian DLM enabling to describe time series data of different features, can be formulated for damage detection of a variety of structures subject to different operational/environmental conditions.Administrative Region, China (Project No. PolyU 152024/17E).

IntroductionHigh-speed rail (HSR) is being developed in Asian and European countries to satisfy the rapidly growing demand for intercity services and to shore up economic growth. The rapid\ngrowth of HSR, however, has posed great challenges regarding operation safety, reliability\nand ride comfort. Irregular wheel defects can induce high-magnitude impact forces hindering safety and ride comfort of HSR and may also cause damage to rail tracks and vehicles.real time. The proposed methodology embraces logics for (i) prognosis, (ii) potential outlier\ndetection, (iii) identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and (iv) quantification of damage extent and uncertainty. Relying on the strain monitoring data acquired from high-speed train bogies, the Bayesian DLM for characterizing the actual stress ranges is established, by which one-step forecast distribution is elicited before proceeding to the\nnext observation. The detection of change-point is executed by comparing the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM) and an alternative model\n(the mean value is shifted by a prescribed offset) to determine which better fits the actual observation. If the comparison results are in favor of the alternative model, it is claimed that a potential change has occurred. Whether such an observation is an outlier or the beginning of a genuine change (change-point), three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum\ncumulative Bayes factor and run length) are performed for further identification. Once a change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for the purpose of\ndamage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification. A severe change, if identified,\ndefects.

Rail accidents were occasionally caused by failures such as severe defects or fatigue of railway components. To maintain a good service quality and operation safety, it is paramount to develop\nonline monitoring techniques that not only quickly recognize faults of mission-critical HSR components but also can anticipate of long-term mechanisms and gradual deterioration in performance.\nWheelsets in a high-speed train are physically connected with and controlled by the bogie system which corrects alignment for stable running and reduces the vibration caused by wheel-rail interaction . However, the wheel performance\nprogressively deteriorates in different mechanisms (e.g., wheel flat and wheel polygonization) during the routine operation of a high-speed train . Wheel performance deterioration increases stresses experienced by the bogie system. In addition,\nthe increased stress within bogie frames caused by wheel quality deterioration can be unexpectedly large, thus posing a serious threat to the operation safety of concerned trains. According to the statistics of train accidents caused by failure in\nmechanical components during 2004 to 2007 in the United States, the wheelsets faults are the most cause with a rate of\n44.7% . Therefore, the railway managers are keen to keep wheels in an adequate condition and detect potential failure\nas soon as possible. For railway wheels, there are three different ways of estimating the conditions: physical modeling, statistical modeling and condition monitoring . However, the first two ways are not applicable to in-service\nwheel condition assessment, and in contrast, the third way is most feasible for wheel condition estimation. The monitoring approaches available to wheel defect detection can be divided into in-workshop inspection and in-service detection . The\nlatter provides the real-time data required for maintenance planning, while the former is normally carried out at workshops at fixed intervals. The commonly used in-workshop methods for wheel defect inspection include the ultrasonic techniques, infrared camera and magnetic methods . In-service monitoring approaches can be categorized as on-board and wayside methods. The on-board methods implement sensors on the train and continuously obtain comprehensive data from\nthe system. The methods of this category include magnetic technique , ultrasonic technique , acoustic technique, and vibration technique . On the other hand, wayside methods attempt to detect the wheel or vehicle performance\nby installing sensors on the rail or its surrounding areas. Such indirect measurements give rise to limited information of the wheel condition while they can monitor all train wheels going by with using only one or a few sensors. According to the type\nof sensors used, wayside detection approaches include strain sensing technology , fiber optic sensing technology ,\nultrasonic technique , vibration technique , acoustic emission , lasers and high-speed cameras . However,\nthe study on data interpretation techniques enabling the extraction of defect-sensitive features is far from sufficient.\nBayesian dynamic linear model (DLM) is an elegant system approach to handling time series data from a Bayesian perspective, which originates from the field of applied statistics and is extensively used in other fields such as economics\nand engineering [25–30]. The Bayesian DLM treats the time series as the output of a dynamic system perturbed by random disturbances. It is suitable for modeling both univariate and multivariate time series, and also for representing the structural changes, non-stationarity and irregular patterns . Unlike the classical time series method which assumes a fixed relationship between the dependent variables (response variables) and the independent variables (regressors), the DLM considers\nthe relationship changes over time and is able to directly capture time series data features, such as trend, seasonality,\nand regression effects. Moreover, the DLM allows for descriptions of temporary or permanent shifts in time series parameters that occur abruptly, which are necessary for outlier and damage detection in structural health monitoring (SHM) paradigms. Recently, Goulet and his collaborator adopted the Bayesian DLM theory in SHM to model the time-dependent\nresponses of structures by breaking them into subcomponents. In the perspective of real-time damage detection, only few studies are available. The first attempt was conducted by Lipowsky et al. with the development of a Bayesian DLM-based\nreal-time detection algorithm to evaluate the performance of a gas turbine using simulated data. Later on, Wang et al.\nand Zhang et al. adopted the above algorithm for detecting high-speed train defects by using real-world monitoring\ndata. In the previous studies, however, the real-time detection algorithm devised possesses only outlier identification and\nchange detection abilities, without the function of damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.context of Bayesian DLM, which incorporates logics for prognosis, potential outlier detection, identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and damage extent and uncertainty quantification. The Bayesian DLM is considered as a tool\nfor time series analysis, while Bayesian forecasting is executed to enable the calculation of one-step ahead forecast distribution. The change-point detection is performed by checking the current observation against the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM for current instant) as well as against an alternative model of which the mean value\nis shifted by a prescribed offset. The detection rule is that if the alternative model better fits the actual observation, a potential change is signaled. To further determine whether such an observation is only an outlier or the beginning of an actual\nchange (change-point), a specific logic is developed by introducing the Bayes factor and the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.\nThe main contributions of this study are the provision of: (i) a formula which not only enables the modeling of actual framework; (ii) three metrics (i.e., the Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) to allow for outlier\nand change-point detection in real-time manner; and (iii) an efficient way for damage extent assessment and uncertainty\nquantification. The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the Bayesian DLM theory and an elaboration of the Bayesian forecasting philosophy. Section 3 presents the defect detection methodology that incorporates logics for\noutlier detection, change-point identification, and damage assessment. In Section 4, two case studies making use of timeseries strain data acquired by fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors affixed on the bogies of an in-service high-speed train are offered to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the proposed methodology. Finally, conclusions are drawn in2. Bayesian DLM and forecastingThe Bayesian DLM is a kind of process-based Bayesian prediction model which provides a flexible way to intuitively capture how processes evolve over time. It consists of two basic equations: an observation (measurement) equation and a system (evolution) equation . The observation (measurement) equation describes the relationship between the observed\nrandom vectors with mean zero and unknown covariance matrices V t and W t. The DLM defined above amounts to treating ht\nrange level at time t, and at represents the stress range change between time t 1 and t. v t is the zero-mean Gaussian random variable representing the error of measurement at moment t. x1t and x2t are both zero-mean Gaussian random variables representing the evolution of DLM from time t 1 to t. In association with the form of DLM in Equation (1), we haveThe Bayesian forecasting philosophy is based on the description of an observed process using its probability density function (PDF). As implied by the name, the Bayesian forecasting approach commences from Bayes’ theorem, hence enabling the calculation of conditional probabilities. The details of using DLM for the recursive one-step ahead forecasting of the (posterior) distribution of monitoring-derived stress ranges under the Bayesian framework are presented as follows\nNote that in Step 4, Atþ1 is the adaptive coefficient which can be viewed as the information tuner. It scales the correction term according to the relative variances of the prior and likelihood, as measured by Rtþ1=Q tþ1 and regressor value Ftþ1. etþ1 is\nthe one-step forward forecast error, the difference between the observed value ytþ1 and its expectation f tþ1. More details\nabout the recursive one-step ahead forecast method can be found in .3. Defect detection methodologyThe proposed defect detection methodology contains three logical processes: outlier detection, change-point detection,\nand damage assessment. By comparing the real-time measurement with the predicted values, the named outlier detection and change-point detection are devised to determine whether the measurement is a single outlier or the first observation of a remarkable change, the former being executed by calculating the Bayes factor, while the latter being based on the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once a change-point is affirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for further damagePotential outlier detection is the first step in the process of the proposed defect detection approach, accomplished by the Bayes factor calculation. Bayes factor is advocated because of its straightforward and natural interpretation of evidence afforded by data. At every time step t, the Bayesian DLM can yield a PDF for the next measurement, labeled as M0. Meanwhile, an artificial alternative model labeled as M1 is defined by shifting the mean of M0 by +h. The underlying idea of outlier\ndetection is to check the current observation against both M0 and M1. For each time step t, the Bayes factor is the ratio of thewhere yt is the measurement at time t and Dt1 refers to the history information up to time t 1. In the case of Gaussianwhere h is the shift value; yt is the observation value; f t and rt are the mean and standard deviation of the forecasting distribution for observation at time t. A Bayes factor H ¼ 1 indicates that the probability of the observation derived from model M1 is identical to the probability of that derived from Model M0. For better quantitative comparison between any two models, Jeffreys suggested interpreting the Bayes factor as a scale of evidence and provided descriptive statements although\nthe partitions are somewhat arbitrary. According to his suggestion, a Bayes factor can be divided into several intervals for assessing the significance of discrimination: 1 < H < 3 is ‘barely worth mentioning’, 3 < H < 10 is ‘substantial’,\n10 < H < 30 is ‘strong’, 30 < H < 100 is ‘very strong’, and H > 100 is ‘decisive’. In this study, Hmin ¼ 10 is set as a threshold\nAfter the confirmation of Hmin and h, an uncertainty limit (ucl) can be procured by the following equationFor instance, when the confidence level a and threshold of Bayes factor Hmin are set as 90% and 10 respectively, the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt. Thus, an observation is diagnosed as an outlier if its deviation from the mean value of M0 is larger\nWith the Bayes factor defined in Equation (9), only outliers with a positive deviation can be detected. To enable the outliers with negative deviation to be detected as well, a second Bayes factor is defined asIn the automatic monitoring process, both the Bayes factors H1;t and H2;t should be examined in parallel to enable thebehavior, rather than judgments based on long past performances. Change-point is an abrupt variation in time series data,\nrepresenting a transition that occurs between states. Change-point detection aims to detect abrupt change in the generative\nprocess of sequential data. It is assumed that a sequence of observations y1; ; yT could be divided into several nonoverlapping partitions, e.g. dataset j 1, dataset j, and dataset j + 1 as shown in Fig. 2. The delineations between partitions\nare known as change-points (e.g. TOC j 1 and TOC j); the goal of change-point detection is the determination of where the\nboundary of two adjacent partitions is located in a sequence of observations. Change-point detection approaches can be classified into offline and online methods. The former needs to observe the whole sequential observations before aiming to make\ninference on the generative process of the sequence [37–40], wheras the latter aims to update the inference at each time step\nwith the newly acquired measurements from the sequence [41–43]. In particular, the Bayesian online change-point detection methods are based on computing the probability distribution of the run length.differentiate between the single-point outlier and the beginning of a continual change. To overcome this problem, cumulative Bayes factor (local Bayes factors) is recommended to detect change-point(s) in the sequence of observations, by definingwhere lmax is the maximum number of Bayes factors taken into account. Unlike Bayes factor with implicitly no historical influence in the judgement, the consecutive Bayes factors collect evidence of change over a series of observation (from time\net al. . Akin to the Bayes factor threshold for outlier detection, the threshold of maximal cumulative Bayes factors is set as Lmin ¼ 10. If the conditions Lt > Lmin and lt > lmin occur simultaneously, an alarm of change is immediately issued at time t\n(time of notification, TON). The real time of occurrence (TOC) is (t lt þ 1), that is, TOC =t lt þ 1.Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is performed to assess damage extent and quantify the\nassociated uncertainty. The proposed approach directly quantifies the likelihoods of two scenarios (e.g., the sequential observations before and after the change-point), that is, ‘‘no fault” and ‘‘fault”, and the yielded results are easy to interpret. An\nadditional merit of the proposed approach is its ability to quantify the uncertainty in damage detection. Assume that the observed sequential data can be divided into two non-overlapping partitions, the first of which is regarded as healthy\nof the observations. Thus, the damage detection problem becomes the test of H0 : l ¼ l0 versus H1 : l–l0 with\nWith the above, damage detection can be achieved by means of Bayes factor which is defined as the ratio of the probability of observations given the alternate hypothesis to the probability of observations given the null hypothesiswhere D ¼ yf 1; ; yng refers to the observed data. It is proven to bewhere refers to the mean of the observed data fy1; ; yng. If no prior information is available, the initial mean and variance can be set as q ¼ l0 and s ¼ r 0 [][. The two assumptions take the prior mean and variance in the alternative hypothesis as]where z ¼ pfn **f** i ffi l0 0 [ At each time step (i.e.,][ n][=1), the Bayes factor][ B][ is larger for the larger values of][ z][j j][, which is reasonable]and easy to interpret. The logarithm of the Bayes factor, for convenience of comparison among a larger of values, is derived asIf the Bayes factor B10 is larger than 1, the implication is that the observed data provide evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis H1 (i.e., the structure is damaged). Otherwise, the observed data are judged to support the null hypothesis H0 (i.e.,\nthe structure is healthy). As with the previous threshold, B10 10 is set as a threshold for damage indication.\nIntegrating together the outlier detection, change-point detection and damage assessment, the implementation procedures of the proposed methodology are shown in Fig. 3. Beginning at time t, the single Bayes factor is firstly evaluated to\njudge whether yt is an outlier. If not, the maximum cumulative Bayes factor Lt and run length lt for change-point detection are calculated. Once a change-point is detected, the intervention is carried out by resetting the time to the time of occurrence\n(i.e., TOC = t lt þ 1) and by adjusting the mean value of M0 to the observation yt (i.e., f t ¼ yt), and the subsequent analysis\nwill then be started at TOC. Meanwhile, Bayesian hypothesis testing is executed for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification from the current TOC to the next TOC.4. Application to in-service monitoring data of high-speed trainAn onboard monitoring system has been designed and implemented on an in-service high-speed passenger train running on the Lanzhou-Urumqi High-Speed Railway (LUHSR) in China . As shown in Fig. 4, the monitoring system is composed\nof a total of 52 FBG strain sensors, 4 FBG temperature sensors, 11 accelerometers (tri-axial) and 1 noise sensor deployed on both motor and trailer bogies. Also, one tri-axial FBG accelerometer, one video camera and two GPS sensors are installed inside a train carriage. As the present work is focused on the real-time detection of potentially defective wheels by using strain monitoring data from bogies, only the deployment of strain sensors is concerned. The strain sensors are mounted\non 4 measurement zones of the bogies: (i) the zone with the action of high loads; (ii) the stress transmission zone; (iii)\nthe zone with high responses predicted by finite element analysis; and (iv) welded joints. FBG strain (and temperature) sensors are deployed and attached to the surface of the train bogie with industrial glue and tapes, and connected to the interrogator (data logger) with laptop inside the train carriage through optical fiber cables.\nThe data utilized in this study were obtained from a monitoring schedule spanning 18 days as shown in Table 1. The total length of the LUHSR between Lanzhou and Urumqi is 1777 km. In the trip from Lanzhou to Urumqi, the high-speed train\nstops by 14 stations and travels cross 13 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 13th); in trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou, the high-speed train stops by 15 stations and travels cross 14 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 14th). During the monitoring\nperiod, the train operated at its normal speed around 200–250 km/h. The sampling rate for all the sensors was set at 5000\nSince the train wheels were lathed (lathing is a process to make wheels perfectly rounded) during the monitoring period,\nthe recorded data contain information in line with two different states (before lathing and after lathing). The wheels can be considered as potentially unhealthy (defective) before lathing and as healthy after lathing. To verify the effectiveness of theproposed real-time defect detection methodology, the strain monitoring data obtained from the bogies before and afterThe train’s dynamic responses may be influenced by different subgrade conditions of the railroad, such as ground, tunnel,\nand bridge. To eliminate the effects of different railroad conditions, the strain data recorded from the same railroad sectionbefore and after lathing, are used in each scenario. In addition, the passenger loads in different trips are deemed statistically identical and the speed of train is assumed to be constant as in normal operation. Without loss of generality, the monitoring\ndata respectively obtained from two typical railroad sections (1st and 14th) in the trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou are chosen to illustrate the proposed real-time defect detection methodology, which are from the strain gauge (MS3-7) deployed at the For the sake of brevity, the monitoring data collected from the 1st railroad section are denoted as Case 1, while those from the 14th railroad section are denoted as Case 2. Firstly, the measured strain is converted to stress for the subsequent stress\nrange calculation. For the strain gauges mounted on the steel surface, the conversion of the measured strain to stress is made by rs ¼ Ee, where E is the elasticity modulus of steel and e is the strain after eliminating the effect of varying temperatures.where em is the measured strain, T m is the measured temperature in the vicinity of the strain sensor, T 0 is the temperature at\nthe installation, and a1 is a constant coefficient. In our case, the original temperature is 4, i.e., T 0 ¼ 4. The results of temperature compensation are demonstrated in Fig. 5. It is obvious that the trend in strain responses caused by temperature\nAfterwards, the stress ranges are extracted from the monitoring-derived stress data by the application of the rainflow\ncounting algorithm. From each stress cycle, the stress range Sa is obtained by calculating the difference between the maximum stress rmax and the minimum stress rmin measured in that stress cycle, i.e., Sa ¼ rmax rmin. More details on the stress ranges extraction are given in . The stress ranges with amplitudes lower than 1 MPa need to be culled because the majority are caused by noise. To decrease the uncertainty arising from the measurement facilities, the average stress ranges for\nevery ten minutes are used as the target quantities. Due to the different lengths of the two selected railroad sections (1st and 14th), the traveling time of the train in each section is also different. This results in different data lengths. The data\nlengths of the average stress ranges in Case 1 and Case 2 are 110 and 90, respectively. Figs. and 7 show the original measured strain responses before and after lathing in Case 1 and Case 2, respectively.Following the implementation procedures mentioned before, the defect detection results for Case 1 are demonstrated in\nFigs. and 9. Fig. 8(a) shows the average stress range (red point) together with 1-step ahead prediction (blue solid line) and\nthe corresponding 90% prediction interval (grey shadow). It is observed that, although some observations at the time interval t 2 fall outside the 90% prediction interval, only the Bayes factor at time t ¼ 55 exceeds the established threshold of Hmin ¼ 10 as shown in Fig. 9(a). It is thus judged as an outlier (marked as h). The reason is that because when applying the proposed approach, the shift parameter is set as h ¼ 1:645rt, resulting in the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt while the other\nfour observations are still within the uncertainty limit. On the other hand, Fig. 9(b)–(c) shows the results of the maximum cumulative Bayes factor and the corresponding run length for change detection. It is seen that the maximum cumulative\nBayes factor values at time instants t ¼ 56; 57 and 58 are larger than the threshold of Lmin ¼ 10, while merely the run length at instant t ¼ 58 surpasses the threshold of lmin ¼ 4. Apparently, this observation at time t ¼ 58 fulfills the conditions of change-point detection causing an alarm to be issued (i.e., TON ¼ 58). The identified real occurrence time of change-point is t ¼ 55 (i.e., TOC ¼ 58 4 þ 1 ¼ 55), which coincides well with the actual time point of lathing the wheels. In accordance\nwith the real-time identification of change-point occurrence, the prediction model is refined by altering the guessed mean\nvalue at TOC, as shown in Fig. 8(b). The predictions near TOC in the refined model obviously agree well with the actual observations, thus offering a better prediction performance than that of the original model.\nThe results of defect detection by means of Bayesian hypothesis testing are illustrated in Fig. 9(d). The discrimination between ‘‘healthy” and ‘‘defective” is quantified by the logarithm value of Bayes factor. It is seen from Fig. 9(d) that the vast\nmajority of logarithm values of Bayes factor before TOC are nearly zero and below the threshold level (dotted red line), which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘healthy state” (no defect). This is consistent with the actual health condition and thus validatesthe capability of the Bayesian hypothesis testing. On the contrary, all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than 2, meaning that the corresponding Bayes factor values exceed 100. According to the classification of Bayes factor stipulated in Sub-section 3.1, this result (H > 100) favors the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity is classified as ‘‘decisive”. Indeed, wheels immediately before being sent to depot for lathing were in the state of ‘heavily defective’.\nMaking use of Eq. (21), the probabilities of damage after TOC are obtained as 100%, that is, the wheels are identified as defective with a very high confidence.\nThe defect detection results for Case 2 are similar to Case 1, and are illustrated in Figs. and 11. As seen in Fig. 11(a)–(c)\nno outlier exists throughout the whole period, but a change-point is identified, of which the time of notification is t ¼ 44 (i.e.,\nTON ¼ 44) and the real time of occurrence is t ¼ 41 (i.e., TOC ¼ 44 4 þ 1 ¼ 41). The result matches well with the actual time point when wheel lathing is inflicted. For the predictions near the change-point, the modified prediction model\n(Fig. 10(b)) offers a better performance than the original model (Fig. 10(a)). As illustrated in Fig. 11(d), all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than the threshold (dotted red line), whereas the values before TOC are within thethreshold line. The values of Bayes factor after TOC are obtained to be higher than 100 (H > 100) and the corresponding probabilities of damage are approximately 100%, which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity\nApart from the accuracy of the proposed approach, the computational efficiency is also of concern. The algorithmic implementation is performed on a Lenovo ThinkCentre M720t desktop (Lenovo, Beijing, China) with Dual Intel Core i7-8700 processor (Intel, California, USA) and 24 GB of memory. The computation times consumed in Case 1 and Case 2 are 4.0109 s and\n3.7704 s respectively. In this sense, it realizes the detection of wheel defects in real time.5. ConclusionsA novel methodology for real-time defect detection of high-speed train wheels using Bayesian forecasting and dynamic linear model (DLM) has been developed and validated in this study. First, the DLM is formulated to approximate the actual\nframework. Afterwards, three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) are elicited for outlier detection and change-point detection. After the change-point has been confirmed, damage assessment is executed by the Bayesian hypothesis testing of the sequential observations before and after the change-point. Due to accommodating the dynamic evolution process and the statistical nature of the method, the proposed approach not only possesses the ability of real-time damage detection, but also enables damage quantification (through classifying the range of Bayes factor) and uncertainty assessment (through calculating the probability of damage). The methodology is illustrated by using the onlinelathing). In the two cases addressed, wheel defects are successfully identified, hence validating the effectiveness of the developed method. The quantitative results about the damage extent and confidence would provide useful information helping to\nmake cost-effective, risk-based decisions with the aim of maintaining the operation safety of high-speed rail.\nDespite the proposed methodology being developed for wheel defect detection of high-speed trains, it can also be applied to low-speed passenger and freight trains as well as extended to SHM for a wide variety of civil infrastructure (e.g., bridges,\nbuildings and tunnels) when vibration signals are available via monitoring. In this study, the second-order polynomial DLM\nis employed to model the stress ranges, which only considers the change of stress range level and trend. However, most longterm SHM data, especially long-term strain monitoring data, are generally contaminated by trend, seasonal (cyclical) and\nregression effects, which require a more complex model. The Bayesian DLM enables the modeling of time-dependent responses of a structure by integrating appropriate components, for instance, the response with cyclical characteristics\ncan be depicted by embedding a seasonal (cyclical) component. Thus, in accordance with the nature of monitoring data,\nan appropriate Bayesian DLM enabling to describe time series data of different features, can be formulated for damage detection of a variety of structures subject to different operational/environmental conditions.Administrative Region, China (Project No. PolyU 152024/17E).

IntroductionHigh-speed rail (HSR) is being developed in Asian and European countries to satisfy the rapidly growing demand for intercity services and to shore up economic growth. The rapid\ngrowth of HSR, however, has posed great challenges regarding operation safety, reliability\nand ride comfort. Irregular wheel defects can induce high-magnitude impact forces hindering safety and ride comfort of HSR and may also cause damage to rail tracks and vehicles.real time. The proposed methodology embraces logics for (i) prognosis, (ii) potential outlier\ndetection, (iii) identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and (iv) quantification of damage extent and uncertainty. Relying on the strain monitoring data acquired from high-speed train bogies, the Bayesian DLM for characterizing the actual stress ranges is established, by which one-step forecast distribution is elicited before proceeding to the\nnext observation. The detection of change-point is executed by comparing the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM) and an alternative model\n(the mean value is shifted by a prescribed offset) to determine which better fits the actual observation. If the comparison results are in favor of the alternative model, it is claimed that a potential change has occurred. Whether such an observation is an outlier or the beginning of a genuine change (change-point), three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum\ncumulative Bayes factor and run length) are performed for further identification. Once a change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for the purpose of\ndamage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification. A severe change, if identified,\ndefects.

Rail accidents were occasionally caused by failures such as severe defects or fatigue of railway components. To maintain a good service quality and operation safety, it is paramount to develop\nonline monitoring techniques that not only quickly recognize faults of mission-critical HSR components but also can anticipate of long-term mechanisms and gradual deterioration in performance.\nWheelsets in a high-speed train are physically connected with and controlled by the bogie system which corrects alignment for stable running and reduces the vibration caused by wheel-rail interaction . However, the wheel performance\nprogressively deteriorates in different mechanisms (e.g., wheel flat and wheel polygonization) during the routine operation of a high-speed train . Wheel performance deterioration increases stresses experienced by the bogie system. In addition,\nthe increased stress within bogie frames caused by wheel quality deterioration can be unexpectedly large, thus posing a serious threat to the operation safety of concerned trains. According to the statistics of train accidents caused by failure in\nmechanical components during 2004 to 2007 in the United States, the wheelsets faults are the most cause with a rate of\n44.7% . Therefore, the railway managers are keen to keep wheels in an adequate condition and detect potential failure\nas soon as possible. For railway wheels, there are three different ways of estimating the conditions: physical modeling, statistical modeling and condition monitoring . However, the first two ways are not applicable to in-service\nwheel condition assessment, and in contrast, the third way is most feasible for wheel condition estimation. The monitoring approaches available to wheel defect detection can be divided into in-workshop inspection and in-service detection . The\nlatter provides the real-time data required for maintenance planning, while the former is normally carried out at workshops at fixed intervals. The commonly used in-workshop methods for wheel defect inspection include the ultrasonic techniques, infrared camera and magnetic methods . In-service monitoring approaches can be categorized as on-board and wayside methods. The on-board methods implement sensors on the train and continuously obtain comprehensive data from\nthe system. The methods of this category include magnetic technique , ultrasonic technique , acoustic technique, and vibration technique . On the other hand, wayside methods attempt to detect the wheel or vehicle performance\nby installing sensors on the rail or its surrounding areas. Such indirect measurements give rise to limited information of the wheel condition while they can monitor all train wheels going by with using only one or a few sensors. According to the type\nof sensors used, wayside detection approaches include strain sensing technology , fiber optic sensing technology ,\nultrasonic technique , vibration technique , acoustic emission , lasers and high-speed cameras . However,\nthe study on data interpretation techniques enabling the extraction of defect-sensitive features is far from sufficient.\nBayesian dynamic linear model (DLM) is an elegant system approach to handling time series data from a Bayesian perspective, which originates from the field of applied statistics and is extensively used in other fields such as economics\nand engineering [25–30]. The Bayesian DLM treats the time series as the output of a dynamic system perturbed by random disturbances. It is suitable for modeling both univariate and multivariate time series, and also for representing the structural changes, non-stationarity and irregular patterns . Unlike the classical time series method which assumes a fixed relationship between the dependent variables (response variables) and the independent variables (regressors), the DLM considers\nthe relationship changes over time and is able to directly capture time series data features, such as trend, seasonality,\nand regression effects. Moreover, the DLM allows for descriptions of temporary or permanent shifts in time series parameters that occur abruptly, which are necessary for outlier and damage detection in structural health monitoring (SHM) paradigms. Recently, Goulet and his collaborator adopted the Bayesian DLM theory in SHM to model the time-dependent\nresponses of structures by breaking them into subcomponents. In the perspective of real-time damage detection, only few studies are available. The first attempt was conducted by Lipowsky et al. with the development of a Bayesian DLM-based\nreal-time detection algorithm to evaluate the performance of a gas turbine using simulated data. Later on, Wang et al.\nand Zhang et al. adopted the above algorithm for detecting high-speed train defects by using real-world monitoring\ndata. In the previous studies, however, the real-time detection algorithm devised possesses only outlier identification and\nchange detection abilities, without the function of damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.context of Bayesian DLM, which incorporates logics for prognosis, potential outlier detection, identification of change occurrence (change-point detection), and damage extent and uncertainty quantification. The Bayesian DLM is considered as a tool\nfor time series analysis, while Bayesian forecasting is executed to enable the calculation of one-step ahead forecast distribution. The change-point detection is performed by checking the current observation against the routine model (forecast distribution generated by the Bayesian DLM for current instant) as well as against an alternative model of which the mean value\nis shifted by a prescribed offset. The detection rule is that if the alternative model better fits the actual observation, a potential change is signaled. To further determine whether such an observation is only an outlier or the beginning of an actual\nchange (change-point), a specific logic is developed by introducing the Bayes factor and the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification.\nThe main contributions of this study are the provision of: (i) a formula which not only enables the modeling of actual framework; (ii) three metrics (i.e., the Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) to allow for outlier\nand change-point detection in real-time manner; and (iii) an efficient way for damage extent assessment and uncertainty\nquantification. The rest of the article is organized as follows. Section 2 introduces the Bayesian DLM theory and an elaboration of the Bayesian forecasting philosophy. Section 3 presents the defect detection methodology that incorporates logics for\noutlier detection, change-point identification, and damage assessment. In Section 4, two case studies making use of timeseries strain data acquired by fiber Bragg grating (FBG) sensors affixed on the bogies of an in-service high-speed train are offered to demonstrate the feasibility and performance of the proposed methodology. Finally, conclusions are drawn in2. Bayesian DLM and forecastingThe Bayesian DLM is a kind of process-based Bayesian prediction model which provides a flexible way to intuitively capture how processes evolve over time. It consists of two basic equations: an observation (measurement) equation and a system (evolution) equation . The observation (measurement) equation describes the relationship between the observed\nrandom vectors with mean zero and unknown covariance matrices V t and W t. The DLM defined above amounts to treating ht\nrange level at time t, and at represents the stress range change between time t 1 and t. v t is the zero-mean Gaussian random variable representing the error of measurement at moment t. x1t and x2t are both zero-mean Gaussian random variables representing the evolution of DLM from time t 1 to t. In association with the form of DLM in Equation (1), we haveThe Bayesian forecasting philosophy is based on the description of an observed process using its probability density function (PDF). As implied by the name, the Bayesian forecasting approach commences from Bayes’ theorem, hence enabling the calculation of conditional probabilities. The details of using DLM for the recursive one-step ahead forecasting of the (posterior) distribution of monitoring-derived stress ranges under the Bayesian framework are presented as follows\nNote that in Step 4, Atþ1 is the adaptive coefficient which can be viewed as the information tuner. It scales the correction term according to the relative variances of the prior and likelihood, as measured by Rtþ1=Q tþ1 and regressor value Ftþ1. etþ1 is\nthe one-step forward forecast error, the difference between the observed value ytþ1 and its expectation f tþ1. More details\nabout the recursive one-step ahead forecast method can be found in .3. Defect detection methodologyThe proposed defect detection methodology contains three logical processes: outlier detection, change-point detection,\nand damage assessment. By comparing the real-time measurement with the predicted values, the named outlier detection and change-point detection are devised to determine whether the measurement is a single outlier or the first observation of a remarkable change, the former being executed by calculating the Bayes factor, while the latter being based on the maximum cumulative Bayes factor. Once a change-point is affirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is conducted for further damagePotential outlier detection is the first step in the process of the proposed defect detection approach, accomplished by the Bayes factor calculation. Bayes factor is advocated because of its straightforward and natural interpretation of evidence afforded by data. At every time step t, the Bayesian DLM can yield a PDF for the next measurement, labeled as M0. Meanwhile, an artificial alternative model labeled as M1 is defined by shifting the mean of M0 by +h. The underlying idea of outlier\ndetection is to check the current observation against both M0 and M1. For each time step t, the Bayes factor is the ratio of thewhere yt is the measurement at time t and Dt1 refers to the history information up to time t 1. In the case of Gaussianwhere h is the shift value; yt is the observation value; f t and rt are the mean and standard deviation of the forecasting distribution for observation at time t. A Bayes factor H ¼ 1 indicates that the probability of the observation derived from model M1 is identical to the probability of that derived from Model M0. For better quantitative comparison between any two models, Jeffreys suggested interpreting the Bayes factor as a scale of evidence and provided descriptive statements although\nthe partitions are somewhat arbitrary. According to his suggestion, a Bayes factor can be divided into several intervals for assessing the significance of discrimination: 1 < H < 3 is ‘barely worth mentioning’, 3 < H < 10 is ‘substantial’,\n10 < H < 30 is ‘strong’, 30 < H < 100 is ‘very strong’, and H > 100 is ‘decisive’. In this study, Hmin ¼ 10 is set as a threshold\nAfter the confirmation of Hmin and h, an uncertainty limit (ucl) can be procured by the following equationFor instance, when the confidence level a and threshold of Bayes factor Hmin are set as 90% and 10 respectively, the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt. Thus, an observation is diagnosed as an outlier if its deviation from the mean value of M0 is larger\nWith the Bayes factor defined in Equation (9), only outliers with a positive deviation can be detected. To enable the outliers with negative deviation to be detected as well, a second Bayes factor is defined asIn the automatic monitoring process, both the Bayes factors H1;t and H2;t should be examined in parallel to enable thebehavior, rather than judgments based on long past performances. Change-point is an abrupt variation in time series data,\nrepresenting a transition that occurs between states. Change-point detection aims to detect abrupt change in the generative\nprocess of sequential data. It is assumed that a sequence of observations y1; ; yT could be divided into several nonoverlapping partitions, e.g. dataset j 1, dataset j, and dataset j + 1 as shown in Fig. 2. The delineations between partitions\nare known as change-points (e.g. TOC j 1 and TOC j); the goal of change-point detection is the determination of where the\nboundary of two adjacent partitions is located in a sequence of observations. Change-point detection approaches can be classified into offline and online methods. The former needs to observe the whole sequential observations before aiming to make\ninference on the generative process of the sequence [37–40], wheras the latter aims to update the inference at each time step\nwith the newly acquired measurements from the sequence [41–43]. In particular, the Bayesian online change-point detection methods are based on computing the probability distribution of the run length.differentiate between the single-point outlier and the beginning of a continual change. To overcome this problem, cumulative Bayes factor (local Bayes factors) is recommended to detect change-point(s) in the sequence of observations, by definingwhere lmax is the maximum number of Bayes factors taken into account. Unlike Bayes factor with implicitly no historical influence in the judgement, the consecutive Bayes factors collect evidence of change over a series of observation (from time\net al. . Akin to the Bayes factor threshold for outlier detection, the threshold of maximal cumulative Bayes factors is set as Lmin ¼ 10. If the conditions Lt > Lmin and lt > lmin occur simultaneously, an alarm of change is immediately issued at time t\n(time of notification, TON). The real time of occurrence (TOC) is (t lt þ 1), that is, TOC =t lt þ 1.Once the change-point is confirmed, Bayesian hypothesis testing is performed to assess damage extent and quantify the\nassociated uncertainty. The proposed approach directly quantifies the likelihoods of two scenarios (e.g., the sequential observations before and after the change-point), that is, ‘‘no fault” and ‘‘fault”, and the yielded results are easy to interpret. An\nadditional merit of the proposed approach is its ability to quantify the uncertainty in damage detection. Assume that the observed sequential data can be divided into two non-overlapping partitions, the first of which is regarded as healthy\nof the observations. Thus, the damage detection problem becomes the test of H0 : l ¼ l0 versus H1 : l–l0 with\nWith the above, damage detection can be achieved by means of Bayes factor which is defined as the ratio of the probability of observations given the alternate hypothesis to the probability of observations given the null hypothesiswhere D ¼ yf 1; ; yng refers to the observed data. It is proven to bewhere refers to the mean of the observed data fy1; ; yng. If no prior information is available, the initial mean and variance can be set as q ¼ l0 and s ¼ r 0 [][. The two assumptions take the prior mean and variance in the alternative hypothesis as]where z ¼ pfn **f** i ffi l0 0 [ At each time step (i.e.,][ n][=1), the Bayes factor][ B][ is larger for the larger values of][ z][j j][, which is reasonable]and easy to interpret. The logarithm of the Bayes factor, for convenience of comparison among a larger of values, is derived asIf the Bayes factor B10 is larger than 1, the implication is that the observed data provide evidence in favor of the alternative hypothesis H1 (i.e., the structure is damaged). Otherwise, the observed data are judged to support the null hypothesis H0 (i.e.,\nthe structure is healthy). As with the previous threshold, B10 10 is set as a threshold for damage indication.\nIntegrating together the outlier detection, change-point detection and damage assessment, the implementation procedures of the proposed methodology are shown in Fig. 3. Beginning at time t, the single Bayes factor is firstly evaluated to\njudge whether yt is an outlier. If not, the maximum cumulative Bayes factor Lt and run length lt for change-point detection are calculated. Once a change-point is detected, the intervention is carried out by resetting the time to the time of occurrence\n(i.e., TOC = t lt þ 1) and by adjusting the mean value of M0 to the observation yt (i.e., f t ¼ yt), and the subsequent analysis\nwill then be started at TOC. Meanwhile, Bayesian hypothesis testing is executed for damage extent assessment and uncertainty quantification from the current TOC to the next TOC.4. Application to in-service monitoring data of high-speed trainAn onboard monitoring system has been designed and implemented on an in-service high-speed passenger train running on the Lanzhou-Urumqi High-Speed Railway (LUHSR) in China . As shown in Fig. 4, the monitoring system is composed\nof a total of 52 FBG strain sensors, 4 FBG temperature sensors, 11 accelerometers (tri-axial) and 1 noise sensor deployed on both motor and trailer bogies. Also, one tri-axial FBG accelerometer, one video camera and two GPS sensors are installed inside a train carriage. As the present work is focused on the real-time detection of potentially defective wheels by using strain monitoring data from bogies, only the deployment of strain sensors is concerned. The strain sensors are mounted\non 4 measurement zones of the bogies: (i) the zone with the action of high loads; (ii) the stress transmission zone; (iii)\nthe zone with high responses predicted by finite element analysis; and (iv) welded joints. FBG strain (and temperature) sensors are deployed and attached to the surface of the train bogie with industrial glue and tapes, and connected to the interrogator (data logger) with laptop inside the train carriage through optical fiber cables.\nThe data utilized in this study were obtained from a monitoring schedule spanning 18 days as shown in Table 1. The total length of the LUHSR between Lanzhou and Urumqi is 1777 km. In the trip from Lanzhou to Urumqi, the high-speed train\nstops by 14 stations and travels cross 13 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 13th); in trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou, the high-speed train stops by 15 stations and travels cross 14 railroad sections (e.g. 1st, 2nd, . . ., 14th). During the monitoring\nperiod, the train operated at its normal speed around 200–250 km/h. The sampling rate for all the sensors was set at 5000\nSince the train wheels were lathed (lathing is a process to make wheels perfectly rounded) during the monitoring period,\nthe recorded data contain information in line with two different states (before lathing and after lathing). The wheels can be considered as potentially unhealthy (defective) before lathing and as healthy after lathing. To verify the effectiveness of theproposed real-time defect detection methodology, the strain monitoring data obtained from the bogies before and afterThe train’s dynamic responses may be influenced by different subgrade conditions of the railroad, such as ground, tunnel,\nand bridge. To eliminate the effects of different railroad conditions, the strain data recorded from the same railroad sectionbefore and after lathing, are used in each scenario. In addition, the passenger loads in different trips are deemed statistically identical and the speed of train is assumed to be constant as in normal operation. Without loss of generality, the monitoring\ndata respectively obtained from two typical railroad sections (1st and 14th) in the trip from Urumqi to Lanzhou are chosen to illustrate the proposed real-time defect detection methodology, which are from the strain gauge (MS3-7) deployed at the For the sake of brevity, the monitoring data collected from the 1st railroad section are denoted as Case 1, while those from the 14th railroad section are denoted as Case 2. Firstly, the measured strain is converted to stress for the subsequent stress\nrange calculation. For the strain gauges mounted on the steel surface, the conversion of the measured strain to stress is made by rs ¼ Ee, where E is the elasticity modulus of steel and e is the strain after eliminating the effect of varying temperatures.where em is the measured strain, T m is the measured temperature in the vicinity of the strain sensor, T 0 is the temperature at\nthe installation, and a1 is a constant coefficient. In our case, the original temperature is 4, i.e., T 0 ¼ 4. The results of temperature compensation are demonstrated in Fig. 5. It is obvious that the trend in strain responses caused by temperature\nAfterwards, the stress ranges are extracted from the monitoring-derived stress data by the application of the rainflow\ncounting algorithm. From each stress cycle, the stress range Sa is obtained by calculating the difference between the maximum stress rmax and the minimum stress rmin measured in that stress cycle, i.e., Sa ¼ rmax rmin. More details on the stress ranges extraction are given in . The stress ranges with amplitudes lower than 1 MPa need to be culled because the majority are caused by noise. To decrease the uncertainty arising from the measurement facilities, the average stress ranges for\nevery ten minutes are used as the target quantities. Due to the different lengths of the two selected railroad sections (1st and 14th), the traveling time of the train in each section is also different. This results in different data lengths. The data\nlengths of the average stress ranges in Case 1 and Case 2 are 110 and 90, respectively. Figs. and 7 show the original measured strain responses before and after lathing in Case 1 and Case 2, respectively.Following the implementation procedures mentioned before, the defect detection results for Case 1 are demonstrated in\nFigs. and 9. Fig. 8(a) shows the average stress range (red point) together with 1-step ahead prediction (blue solid line) and\nthe corresponding 90% prediction interval (grey shadow). It is observed that, although some observations at the time interval t 2 fall outside the 90% prediction interval, only the Bayes factor at time t ¼ 55 exceeds the established threshold of Hmin ¼ 10 as shown in Fig. 9(a). It is thus judged as an outlier (marked as h). The reason is that because when applying the proposed approach, the shift parameter is set as h ¼ 1:645rt, resulting in the uncertainty limit ucl ¼ 2:22rt while the other\nfour observations are still within the uncertainty limit. On the other hand, Fig. 9(b)–(c) shows the results of the maximum cumulative Bayes factor and the corresponding run length for change detection. It is seen that the maximum cumulative\nBayes factor values at time instants t ¼ 56; 57 and 58 are larger than the threshold of Lmin ¼ 10, while merely the run length at instant t ¼ 58 surpasses the threshold of lmin ¼ 4. Apparently, this observation at time t ¼ 58 fulfills the conditions of change-point detection causing an alarm to be issued (i.e., TON ¼ 58). The identified real occurrence time of change-point is t ¼ 55 (i.e., TOC ¼ 58 4 þ 1 ¼ 55), which coincides well with the actual time point of lathing the wheels. In accordance\nwith the real-time identification of change-point occurrence, the prediction model is refined by altering the guessed mean\nvalue at TOC, as shown in Fig. 8(b). The predictions near TOC in the refined model obviously agree well with the actual observations, thus offering a better prediction performance than that of the original model.\nThe results of defect detection by means of Bayesian hypothesis testing are illustrated in Fig. 9(d). The discrimination between ‘‘healthy” and ‘‘defective” is quantified by the logarithm value of Bayes factor. It is seen from Fig. 9(d) that the vast\nmajority of logarithm values of Bayes factor before TOC are nearly zero and below the threshold level (dotted red line), which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘healthy state” (no defect). This is consistent with the actual health condition and thus validatesthe capability of the Bayesian hypothesis testing. On the contrary, all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than 2, meaning that the corresponding Bayes factor values exceed 100. According to the classification of Bayes factor stipulated in Sub-section 3.1, this result (H > 100) favors the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity is classified as ‘‘decisive”. Indeed, wheels immediately before being sent to depot for lathing were in the state of ‘heavily defective’.\nMaking use of Eq. (21), the probabilities of damage after TOC are obtained as 100%, that is, the wheels are identified as defective with a very high confidence.\nThe defect detection results for Case 2 are similar to Case 1, and are illustrated in Figs. and 11. As seen in Fig. 11(a)–(c)\nno outlier exists throughout the whole period, but a change-point is identified, of which the time of notification is t ¼ 44 (i.e.,\nTON ¼ 44) and the real time of occurrence is t ¼ 41 (i.e., TOC ¼ 44 4 þ 1 ¼ 41). The result matches well with the actual time point when wheel lathing is inflicted. For the predictions near the change-point, the modified prediction model\n(Fig. 10(b)) offers a better performance than the original model (Fig. 10(a)). As illustrated in Fig. 11(d), all the logarithm values of Bayes factor after TOC are larger than the threshold (dotted red line), whereas the values before TOC are within thethreshold line. The values of Bayes factor after TOC are obtained to be higher than 100 (H > 100) and the corresponding probabilities of damage are approximately 100%, which advocate the hypothesis of ‘‘damage existence” and the damage severity\nApart from the accuracy of the proposed approach, the computational efficiency is also of concern. The algorithmic implementation is performed on a Lenovo ThinkCentre M720t desktop (Lenovo, Beijing, China) with Dual Intel Core i7-8700 processor (Intel, California, USA) and 24 GB of memory. The computation times consumed in Case 1 and Case 2 are 4.0109 s and\n3.7704 s respectively. In this sense, it realizes the detection of wheel defects in real time.5. ConclusionsA novel methodology for real-time defect detection of high-speed train wheels using Bayesian forecasting and dynamic linear model (DLM) has been developed and validated in this study. First, the DLM is formulated to approximate the actual\nframework. Afterwards, three metrics (i.e., Bayes factor, maximum cumulative Bayes factor and run length) are elicited for outlier detection and change-point detection. After the change-point has been confirmed, damage assessment is executed by the Bayesian hypothesis testing of the sequential observations before and after the change-point. Due to accommodating the dynamic evolution process and the statistical nature of the method, the proposed approach not only possesses the ability of real-time damage detection, but also enables damage quantification (through classifying the range of Bayes factor) and uncertainty assessment (through calculating the probability of damage). The methodology is illustrated by using the onlinelathing). In the two cases addressed, wheel defects are successfully identified, hence validating the effectiveness of the developed method. The quantitative results about the damage extent and confidence would provide useful information helping to\nmake cost-effective, risk-based decisions with the aim of maintaining the operation safety of high-speed rail.\nDespite the proposed methodology being developed for wheel defect detection of high-speed trains, it can also be applied to low-speed passenger and freight trains as well as extended to SHM for a wide variety of civil infrastructure (e.g., bridges,\nbuildings and tunnels) when vibration signals are available via monitoring. In this study, the second-order polynomial DLM\nis employed to model the stress ranges, which only considers the change of stress range level and trend. However, most longterm SHM data, especially long-term strain monitoring data, are generally contaminated by trend, seasonal (cyclical) and\nregression effects, which require a more complex model. The Bayesian DLM enables the modeling of time-dependent responses of a structure by integrating appropriate components, for instance, the response with cyclical characteristics\ncan be depicted by embedding a seasonal (cyclical) component. Thus, in accordance with the nature of monitoring data,\nan appropriate Bayesian DLM enabling to describe time series data of different features, can be formulated for damage detection of a variety of structures subject to different operational/environmental conditions.Administrative Region, China (Project No. PolyU 152024/17E).
