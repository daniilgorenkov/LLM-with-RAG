Therefore, the**Fig. 10** Buckling mode prediction considering initial lateral stiffness and sleeper’s displacement limit **a** 0. mm **b** 1 mm **c** 2 mmmodel’s initial stiffness and the lateral displacement limit are set at 200 N/mm and 1 mm, respectively, based on prior On April 20, 2017, historical data indicates that the air temperature was recorded at 36 °C.

Consequently, the increase in rail temperature was assumed to be from the\nThe proposed model is utilised for analysis, setting several parameters based on above assumptions. These include the initial lateral stiffness of the track, the displacement limit for sleepers, and the track’s unconstrained length.**Fig. 11** Buckling mode prediction considering lateral misalignment and lateral resistance **a** 300 N/mm **b** 600 N/mm **c** 1200 N/mm **d** 1800 N/Our focus is on varying the lateral misalignment within a specific range to understand its impact. Additionally, we adjust the rail temperature to examine both the temperature at which buckling occurs and the mode of buckling.\nFigure 13 illustrates the relationship between the increase in rail temperature and lateral misalignment. We observe\nthat buckling begins at a temperature of 25 °C, exhibiting a progressive buckling mode when the initial lateral misalignment is larger than 28 mm. Notably, the predicted temperature at which buckling occurs aligns closely with\ntemperatures recorded in real-world field conditions with only lower bound difference of 3.9% illustrated in Fig. 13.\nThis also corresponds well with the phenomena of progressive buckling mode, which typically occurs with smalllateral displacement after buckling as observed in the field. Therefore, the proposed machine learning model is trustworthy and can be used further for the buckling prediction and early warning system development.This study has demonstrated the substantial potential of machine learning (ML) in enhancing the predictability of buckling failure modes in ballasted railway tracks. Through the deployment of various advanced ML algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, k-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest and XGBoost, LGBM, we have successfully developed models that offer accurate predictions of track buckling behaviour under a range of conditions. The significant\nachievement of these models, especially the XGBoost algorithm which recorded an F1 score of 0.97, marks a pivotal advancement in the field of railway engineering. This outcome not only demonstrates the robustness of ML models in\ncomplex failure prediction but also opens new avenues for enhancing railway track safety and operational efficiency. We are the first to introduce a detailed analysis of the track buckling phases using ML models, taking into account a variety However, it is essential to note that the limitations of the current models, particularly the reliance on specific parameters that require prior calculations, such as initial lateral stiffness and sleeper’s displacement limit that could be linkedto different physical geometries and material properties of sleeper and ballast. Furthermore, the rail misalignments are approximated using a sine wave, a simplification that contrasts with the more complex realities of actual track\nalignment. This model focuses on filtering out the short wavelength variations in rail alignment, offering a simplified yet effective representation of the tracks. By adopting this approach, the analysis becomes more practical, despite the acknowledgment that real-world rail deviations may exhibit greater complexity. Thus, prior to incorporating the actual track alignment into this machine learning model, an initial justification is required. This step ensures that the simplified sine wave representation aligns with the intended analysis objectives, balancing simplicity with the need to accurately reflect real-world track conditions.

Therefore, the proposed machine learning model is trustworthy and can be used further for the buckling prediction and early warning system development.This study has demonstrated the substantial potential of machine learning (ML) in enhancing the predictability of buckling failure modes in ballasted railway tracks. Through the deployment of various advanced ML algorithms, including Logistic Regression, Decision Tree, k-Nearest Neighbor, Random Forest and XGBoost, LGBM, we have successfully developed models that offer accurate predictions of track buckling behaviour under a range of conditions. The significant\nachievement of these models, especially the XGBoost algorithm which recorded an F1 score of 0.97, marks a pivotal advancement in the field of railway engineering. This outcome not only demonstrates the robustness of ML models in\ncomplex failure prediction but also opens new avenues for enhancing railway track safety and operational efficiency. We are the first to introduce a detailed analysis of the track buckling phases using ML models, taking into account a variety However, it is essential to note that the limitations of the current models, particularly the reliance on specific parameters that require prior calculations, such as initial lateral stiffness and sleeper’s displacement limit that could be linkedto different physical geometries and material properties of sleeper and ballast. Furthermore, the rail misalignments are approximated using a sine wave, a simplification that contrasts with the more complex realities of actual track\nalignment. This model focuses on filtering out the short wavelength variations in rail alignment, offering a simplified yet effective representation of the tracks. By adopting this approach, the analysis becomes more practical, despite the acknowledgment that real-world rail deviations may exhibit greater complexity. Thus, prior to incorporating the actual track alignment into this machine learning model, an initial justification is required. This step ensures that the simplified sine wave representation aligns with the intended analysis objectives, balancing simplicity with the need to accurately reflect real-world track conditions. These limitations highlight areas for future research, where efforts could be directed towards refining the models for greater applicability in in-field scenarios.

By adopting this approach, the analysis becomes more practical, despite the acknowledgment that real-world rail deviations may exhibit greater complexity. Thus, prior to incorporating the actual track alignment into this machine learning model, an initial justification is required. This step ensures that the simplified sine wave representation aligns with the intended analysis objectives, balancing simplicity with the need to accurately reflect real-world track conditions. These limitations highlight areas for future research, where efforts could be directed towards refining the models for greater applicability in in-field scenarios. In conclusion, the integration of machine in railway engineering. The models developed in this study offer a promising direction for future research and practical\napplication, paving the way for safer, more efficient railway systems.**Acknowledgements** This project is supported by National Research Council of Thailand (NRCT: N42A650199).
