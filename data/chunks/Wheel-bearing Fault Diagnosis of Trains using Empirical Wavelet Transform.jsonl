The segmentation of the frequency spectrum and the EWT results are shown inis obvious that mode 2 and mode 3 contains more abundant impulse information. Therefore, Hilbert envelope analysis is applied to mode 2 and mode 3. Both the frequency component 27.08Hz closing to therecognized. From Fig. (b), we can see the high frequency components occupy a large proportion and itTo extract all the information about the failure, the EWT method is applied to analyze the vibration signal. The segmentation and decomposition result are shown in Fig. and Fig. (a) and (b). There are no obvious differences among the three modes. Therefore, we apply the Hilbert envelope transform to all the modes, respectively. Fig. (a), (b) and (c) are the Hilbert envelope spectrum of the three modes.From Fig. (a), we couldn’t find any fault characteristic frequency. In Fig. (b), we could find frequency components 27.78Hz closing to outer race fault characteristic frequency 27.results of mode 2 and mode 3, we can infer the existence of outer-race and roller composite fault.\nAlthough EWT can’t separate these two faults into different modes completely, the results also indicate that the feature of compound faults can be extracted, which means that the compound faults of theanalysis results in different fault cases (i.e., outer race fault, roller fault, and the compound fault of outer\nrace and roller). Moreover, some problems also exist in the empirical wavelet transform. For example,\nhow to segment the spectrum adaptively is still needed to be studied. More investigations focused on the\nEWT methods and the application in fault diagnosis would be carried out in the future.The author would like to express heartfelt appreciation to Dr. Gilles for his research.\nThis work was supported by National Natural Science Foundation of China (No. 51421004，51575423), Natural Science Basic Research Plan in Shaanxi Province of China (No. S2013JC9908)", "year": "1998"}}
