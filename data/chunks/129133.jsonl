{"text": "Introduction**The accuracy and reliability of wheelset resistance measurements are critical for the safe operation of rail vehicles and for proper interaction with detection systems based on the short-circuiting of track circuits by the vehicle’s wheelsets, which are used in railway traffic control (RTC). These measurements are subject to various types of disturbances and errors arising from material inhomogeneity (e.g. of the probe or wheel material) and changing electrical contact conditions (e.g. contamination).In traditional data analysis, error detection is typically based on fixed thresholds or statistical analysis.", "metadata": {"doc_id": "129133", "section": "ROOT", "level": 0, "chunk_id": 0, "year": "2025"}}
