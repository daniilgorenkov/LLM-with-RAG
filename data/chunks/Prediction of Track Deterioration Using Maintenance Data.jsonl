In this regard, quite a few models with simplified assumptions on the parameters have been suggested for the deterioration of ballasted track. Meanwhile, data driven models such as the artificial neural network (ANN) and support vector regression (SVR), which are basic ingredients of machine learning (ML) technology,\nthe optimization schemes.

These aforementioned parameters are normally categorized along the track measurement vehicle (TMV) are available. One of the main advantages of the data-driven model is that it predicts track conditions\ntrack geometry including the number of tampings as well as regression results of TQI as a function of passing tonnages.

For these objectives, a commercial statistical package as well as a public domain library called LIBSVM\nimported into the decision support system (DSS) within the framework of ERP or EAM (Lovett 2017), and future work will be concentrated on the combination of DSS with TMV and Internet ofEarlier applications of data-driven models to predict track deterioration can be found in Shafahi et al. (2008). They considered six\ndeterioration rates of rail, sleeper, ballast, and fastener. They applied one hidden layer in the model and studied the best combination of number of neurons as well as TQI parameters. Guler (2013)\nAnother application of the data driven model to track deterioration can be found in Hu and Liu (2016). They originally adopted parameters such as traffic volumes, track class, and inspection intervals. A more detailed application of the SVM to predict track classification were modeled by Gamma process, binary logistic regression, and SVM, respectively. In this case, the regression model purpose, differences in the measured track irregularities (amplitude), mean tonnage, time interval, and track identification number,\nfailure in the system. Since the measurement data of important railway equipment are stored on a daily basis in many cases, the corresponding prediction based on the ANN or SVM has to be updatedi.e., neurons, to model the track degradation realistically. For this,\nfirst. Sadeghi and Askarinejad (2007) showed that the track deterioration could be represented by the combined effect of the superstructure, substructure, and track geometry conditions as shown\ncurvature, gradient, and cross level in the track deterioration model.\nmodeled during the ANN training and, as a result, the track deterioration rates were predicted using the field measurement data with The number of parameters mentioned previously could be reduced if our interest is confined to a specific high-speed rail route,\nparameters of the track deterioration from the previous studies mentioned previously, and our interest will therefore be concentrated on\n2002. The design speed of HSR is 350 km=h and the corresponding minimum radius of the circular curve is 7,000 m. The minimumIn our case, the assumption of the same properties within a specific route is necessary because the maintenance data including TQI were not available in our case, the corresponding data were obtained by assuming a deterioration model, and the deterioration rate\nwas subsequently estimated. For this purpose, the linear deterioration model (Lee et al. 2018) shown in Fig. was again used to represent tamping only (TO) and renewal and tamping (RT), respectively, and AL and WL mean action level and warning level,NT represent the deterioration constants and the number of tampings, respectively, and ri is the current deterioration rate. TheThe influence of the substructure in track deterioration can be established according to the type of infrastructure, such as a tunnel,ratio in Eq. (3) for each segment having a specific type of superstructure. Also shown in Table 1 is the length of each structure andthe plane section, and the length ratio is evaluated based on the total\nlength of plane section. As can be expected, the number of tampings in the segments of the competition curve are greater than those Detailed data on the number of tampings according to the magnitude of radius were not available and, therefore, the classification\npresented in Table 2 will be used as a multiplier, χ, during the derivation of TQI for curved segments. It is noted that the maintenancecase, if the train speed is reduced, the deceleration force is applied model. The main difference between SVR and ANN lies in the usage of the kernel function in the SVR, which is similar to the transfer function in the ANN. In the SVR, the kernel function transforms\nof tolerance, ε, so that the regression result will be insensitive to the\npredicted value is deviated from the target value, y, at most ε for allof the high-speed rail are not available at this moment, and artificial\nand the number of tampings shown in Fig. were artificially created using a random number generator. From these, the current\nas multipliers, χ, in Eq. (3) so that the variations of the deterioration\nrate owing to the influential parameters were obtained. Furthermore, perturbation on the deterioration rate was made by adding\nshown in Fig. 7. As can be expected, when the perturbation parameter, κ, of Eq. (16) is increased, the deterioration rate becomes linear and the prediction errors will be decreased accordingly.
