These measurements are subject to various types of disturbances and errors arising from material inhomogeneity (e.g. of the probe or wheel material) and changing electrical contact conditions (e.g. contamination).In traditional data analysis, error detection is typically based on fixed thresholds or statistical analysis."

Gaussian emissions between 2 and 5 states were considered for adjusting hyperparameters, with a 3-state HMM chosen for segmentation as it effectively eliminated segments between wheel movements.The segmentation captures three phases of a wheel’s movement: approach, detection, and departure from the sensor. This detailed segmentation helps identify the effects of a defective wheel on the accelerometer signal.

Once the hyperplane is learned, new observations can be classified as normal or anomalous based on their distance to the hyperplane.

Using PFA for a subset of the attained time series representation, it was possible to select damage-sensitive features with minimal redundancy. With the selected features a single severity indicator was computed based on the iForest anomaly score. This completed the fault diagnosis with (1) detection of aberrant train behavior; (2) isolation of specific defective wheels; (3) identification of the severity."

Support Vector Regression (SVR)Support Vector Regression (SVR) finds a valuable application in anomaly detection when considering its capabilities beyond traditional regression tasks. While SVM is primarily associated with classification and SVR with regression, both can be adapted for anomaly detection purposes. In the context of anomaly detection, SVR departs from its traditional regression objectives. Instead of fitting a hyperplane that best captures the data distribution, the goal of SVR is to identify anomalies or outliers that do not fit the expected patterns within the data set."

Vibration signal analysis is the most popular technique that is used for rolling element bearing monitoring, however, the application of vibration signal analysis for wheel bearings is quite limited in practice. In this paper, a novel method called empirical wavelet transform (EWT) is used for the vibration signal analysis and fault diagnosis of wheel-bearing. The EWT method combines the classic wavelet with the empirical mode decomposition, which is suitable for the non-stationary vibration signals."

The integration of transfer learning and real-time implementation in real-time settings should also be considered. Additionally, validation on diverse datasets, deployment in real-time environments, and integration with automated decision-making systems are promising areas for further investigation.

The formation mechanism is strongly contingent on the vehicle type and its operational characteristics, with the resultant effects on both the track and the vehicle intricately linked to the prevalence of dominant harmonic orders [19–22]. For example, Tao et al.  studied asymmetrical polygonal wear on metro wheels and obtained harmonic orders of 12–14, while another study by Tao et al.  found that the most common harmonic order in Chinese freight trains is 18–19."

Although a polygonal wheel could generate less impact on the track than a wheel flat, this defect can cause serious damage to the track due to resonance effects in the wheelsets by increasing the vibration in these components .To identify the occurrence of these OOR anomalies in train wheels, innovative methodologies have been developed combining signal processing and automatic learning techniques. These methodologies are based on the extraction of damage sensitivity features, making possible the distinction between undamaged and damaged situations."

The initial defects of the wheel, such as wheel reprofiling, static and dynamic inequities, and inhomogeneous properties of the wheel material, are crucial factors affecting the origin and development of the Out-of-Round (OOR) wheel. The appearance of surface defects can occur mainly when sliding on the tracks in case wheels are seized. In railway applications, this phenomenon can lead to the formation of martensite at the edges of induced shells and happens due to rolling contact fatigue."

In subsurface defects, fatigue failure of rolling contact is one of the majorfaults in railway wheels, caused by recurrent rolling contact with tracks. This fatigue failure is induced by internal defects such as non-metallic inclusions or blisters in the wheels.

With an entire cross profile of the wheel, accurate and reliable parameters of wheel size are gained.

They also cause noise and vibration emissions that are costly to mitigate. We propose two machine learning methods to automatically detect these wheel defects, based on the wheel vertical force measured by a permanently installed sensor system on the railway network. Our methods automatically learn different types of wheel defects and predict during normal operation if a wheel has a defect or not. The first method is based on novel features for classifying time series data and it is used for classification with a support vector machine."

Therefore as a first step in all experiments we re-balance the class proportions of the data sets by randomly over-sampling the smaller class through sampling with replacement. While balanced data sets are useful for comparing methods and data sets, in a real-world setting the true proportion of the classes is important and mistakes for different types of error might have different cost. Therefore we recommend to give class probability estimates for each class when implementing such a system and then adapting a threshold for raising an alarm iteratively"

It is responsible for supporting the weight of the train, transmitting traction, ensuring stability and guidance on the tracks. One of the most common problems with train wheels is out-of-roundness (OOR), which can result in rail damage and sleeper cracking, as well as high-cycle fatigue of wheels and other vehicle components (X. Z. Liu, 2019). Currently, railway operators mostly depend on visual inspections that are performed by experienced staff to identify train wheel OOR faults. Furthermore, they may find faults based on passenger complaints or reports of excessive"

Regular wear is caused by modest fluctuations in contact forces and creepages caused by the wheelset's longitudinal and lateral motion on the track.

They also cause noise and vibration emissions that are costly to mitigate. We propose two machine learning methods to automatically detect these wheel defects, based on the wheel vertical force measured by a permanently installed sensor system on the railway network. Our methods automatically learn different types of wheel defects and predict during normal operation if a wheel has a defect or not. The first method is based on novel features for classifying time series data and it is used for classification with a Support Vector Machine."
