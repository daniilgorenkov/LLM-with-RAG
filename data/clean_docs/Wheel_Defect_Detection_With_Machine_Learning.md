Each time series is now represented by the distributions of the wavelet coefficients at the different levels offrom the following observation: certain defect classes like nonroundness mostly change the average of a sensor reading, butmodels (DNN). These models have gained considerable popularity in recent years, mostly due to their success in imagewavelet features for each sensor separately. Whereas the feature construction based on the full signal pursued the strategyAs a second 2D representation we also considered transforming the time series into the image of its 2D graph. Thisa) Convolutional layer: A convolutional layer is a combination of a number of filtering layers, each followed byUnit ( PReLU ), as it better back-propagates the gradient compared to the tangent hyperbolic or sigmoid functions, which2) The network then distributes the set of 8 feature vectors vi (the colored vertical bars in Fig. 5) acrossbars in Fig. 5), one for each possible cyclic permutation of the feature vectors.

Unlike the previous section, where the classification function f ( - ) was modeled as a linear function in a Hilbert space,greatly outperforms prior art based on thresholding the dynamical coefficient (Eq. below) and also on multiple instance The second data set serves to demonstrate that the WaveletSVM can accurately classify all three defect types. We alsothe task is to distinguish between one defect type and nondefective. This enables clear comparison between the differentalgorithm for MIL . Krummenacher et al. beat stateof-the art MIL algorithms on this data set and get a classification accuracy of 70% with ellipsoidal multiple instanceon the within measurement time series since they are a nondiscrete type of wheel defects. They do introduce variationsby using a custom deep neural network (DNN) that is cyclicshift invariant for classification of these defect types.on a wagon necessarily share a defect.
