This paper aims to present an unsupervised
methodology to detect railway wheel flats. The automatic damage detection algorithm is based on the acceleration evaluated on the rails for the passage of traffic loads. The results of this research study show that only one sensor is enough to detect wheel flat
this method is rarely used. In addition, onboard detection techniques are commonly used to monitor the track condition rather than the wheel condition. However, wayside measurement systems continue to provide the best way to identify
wheel defects, since the condition of all wheels is assessed during the passage of trains in service.In previous studies, advanced signal processing methods were used to eliminate signal interference to diagnose research has been conducted on the detection of infrastructure defects (Defossez et al., 2015; Mohammadi et al., 2022;
a limited amount of literature has been published on automatic wheel flat identification. Therefore, artificial intelligence (AI) can be used to detect a defective wheel at an early stage and improve safety and reduce operatingMany researchers (Atamuradov et al., 2019; Do et al., 2019; Gibert et al., 2015; Meixedo et al., 2016; Meixedo et
al., 2021; Nenov et al., 2011) used several machine learning algorithms to analyze the data, implement a learning
scheme, and apply intelligent decisions regarding the presence of wheel flats, including artificial neural networks
(ANN), principal component analysis (PCA), and support vector machines (SVM).Although a number of publications have been published about railway defect detection, there is limited literature on automatic early wheel flat detection to the best of the authors' knowledge. According to most wheel flat detection
schemes, there is no indicator that can automatically differentiate a defective from a healthy wheel. Additionally, in all the above studies, multiple sensors are required to distinguish a defective wheel from a healthy one. Consequently,
detect a wheel flat, using only one sensor installed on the rail. The goal of this paper is to develop a 3D numerical dynamic model of vehicle-track coupling system and to develop an indicator for automatically detecting healthy
wheels from defective ones. The acceleration measurement points are strategically defined in order to examine the
sensitivity of the proposed methodology, to the position where they are installed.An in-house software program, VSI-Vehicle-Structure Interaction Analysis, is used for numerical train-track
dynamic interaction simulations that have been validated and described in detail in a previous publication (Montenegro et al., 2015). In this model, the train is coupled to the track via a 3D wheel-rail contact model that uses Hertzian theory
(Hertz, 1882) to compute the normal contact forces and USETAB routine (Kalker, 1996) to compute the tangential which imports structural matrices modeled in a finite element (FE) package for both the vehicle and the track. In this the rails and sleepers, spring-dashpot elements to simulate the behavior of the flexible layers, such as the ballast and primary and secondary suspension, rigid beams to consider rigid body movements, and mass point elements located
at the center of gravity of each body, namely carbodies, bogies, and wheelsets, to simulate their mass and inertial effects. The authors' previous publications describe both track and train models in detail (Mosleh et al., 2021; Mosleh,A virtual simulation of baseline (undamaged) and damaged wheel scenarios is accomplished to test and validate the automatic wheel flat detection approach presented in this study. Three intervals are defined for a damaged wheelAraliya Mosleh et al. / Transportation Research Procedia 72 (2023) 4199–4206 4201due to different wheel flat lengths (𝐿𝐿) and nominated as L1, L2 and L3. The uniform distributions U (10, 20) [mm], U
(25, 50) [mm] and U (55,100) [mm] define the lower and upper limits of the wheel flat length for each interval L1, L2
and L3 respectively. In which 𝑅 **𝑅** is the radius of the wheel. The vertical profile deviation of the wheel flat (Z) iswhere H represents the Heaviside function. The acceleration of the rail is evaluated for the 19 sensors shown in Figure 1, including several scenarios, for both baseline (undamaged) and damaged conditions to test the proposed
methodology. Table 1 summarizes the 100 simulations of the undamaged scenarios that aim at reproducing the responses of the rail considering several speeds, loading schemes and unevenness profiles of the rail.according to the details provided by Mosleh et al. (Mosleh, Costa, et al., 2020b). The dynamic analyses are carried out for one passing vehicle of the Alfa Pendular (AP) passenger train (Ribeiro et al., 2013). Moreover, 150 simulationsFlat characteristics - Flat lengths: 10-20 (L1), 25-50 (L2), 55-100 (L3) mmfollowing five steps (Meixedo et al., 2021): (i) data acquisition, (ii) features extraction from acquired responses using an autoregressive (AR) model, (iii) feature normalization to remove the environmental and operational variations
(EOVs) by applying a latent-variable method named principal component analysis (PCA), (iv) data fusion, through the implementation of a Mahalanobis distance, to merge the features from each sensor and enhance sensitivity to
detect wheel defects, and (v) unsupervised feature classification through outlier analyses (Meixedo et al., 2022).In this study, individual AR (30) parameters are used to fit each accelerometer's time series, and their parameters are used as damage-sensitive features. Therefore, the outcome of applying the AR model to the 250 scenarios for each
of the 19 measurements presented in Fig. is a three-dimensional feature matrix of 250 by 30 by 19. Fig. shows 4
features out of 30 for all 250 scenarios for the accelerations measured on position 1. Due to the condition of the train's wheel, the features are divided into two major categories, namely baseline scenarios (first 100 passages) and damaged
scenarios (150 subsequent passages). For damaged scenarios, simulations 101 to 150 consider the passage of a vehicle with a wheel flat length between 10 and 20 mm (L1), while simulations 151 to 200 consider a wheel flat length
between 25 and 50 mm (L2). Afterward, the range of 55 to 100 mm (L3) is considered for the wheel flat length corresponding to simulations 201 to 250. As presented in this figure, the AR parameters for damaged scenarios exhibitPerforming PCA modeling on AR parameters resulted in a 19-by-30 matrix that has PCA-based features for every vehicle passage. Since the cumulative percentage of variance for the first component is greater than 80%, it is
discarded during model development (i.e., p = 1). For the accelerations measured on position 1, Fig. shows four PCA features out of 30 for all 250 baseline and damaged scenarios. As presented in this figure, although suppression of the
changes generated by EOVs, the differences between healthy wheels and damaged ones are not sufficient to detect a
defective wheel. Therefore, a data fusion is performed and discussed in the next section.Araliya Mosleh et al. / Transportation Research Procedia 72 (2023) 4199–4206 4203
The Mahalanobis distance transforms the 30 AR-PCA-based parameters into one single damage-sensitive feature for each sensor and vehicle passage. For each of the 19 sensors, this procedure yields a 250-by-1 vector of
distances. Fig. shows a noticeable improvement in sensitivity for the various sensors.4.5. Automatic wheel flat detection based on a statistical approachto low, median and severe wheel flat lengths. From the results presented in this figure, it is possible to infer that the methodology can effectively detect all the damage scenarios without any false positives or false negatives. One of the
main advantages of the proposed methodology is that it is not necessary to install a series of sensors on the rail. Only
one sensor is adequate to detect a defective wheel. Therefore, the proposed methodology has the advantage of minimizing the cost of the installation system, as well as allowing a more automatic and straightforward
the rail. A defective wheel can only be detected by only one sensor. Due to this, the proposed methodology has the advantage of requiring only one sensor and therefore minimizing the cost of the installation system, as well as allowing Future work includes a field trial to evaluate further the usefulness of the technology developed. Moreover, for the final development of the proposed methodology, it is imperative to develop an automatic indicator to distinguish a
wheel flat from other types of wheel defects, i.e., polygonization or out of roundness.This work was financially supported by Base Funding-UIDB/04708/2020 and Programmatic Funding-UIDP/04708/2020 of the CONSTRUCT - Instituto de Estruturas e Construções, funded
