the active learning capability of the model in identifying wheel flat features from wheel acceleration signals.To verify the accuracy of the regression model in predicting the fault degree, 60 sets of data were totallyindicate the wheel radius values. The blue line corresponds to the real value, while the orange line is theIn this paper, the regression model was quantitatively evaluated for wheel radius difference and wheel flat using the mean squared error (MSE), mean absolute error (MAE), and R-squared values. The resultssmall and that the R-squared value is close to 1, indicating that the model has a good predictive ability for
