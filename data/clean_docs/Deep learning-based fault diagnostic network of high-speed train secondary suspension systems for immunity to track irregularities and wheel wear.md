## Deep learning-based fault diagnostic network of high-speed train secondary suspension systems for immunity to track irregularities and wheel weartrain running safety. Firstly, the existing methods concerning fault detection or isolation of train suspension systems are briefly reviewed and divided into two categories, i.e., model-based and data-driven approaches. Theapproaches are briefly summarized. Secondly, a 1D convolution network-based fault diagnostic method for highspeed train suspension systems is designed. To improve theGWN-EST-1DCNN method. Thirdly, to show the performance of this method, a multibody dynamics simulationtrack irregularities, wheel profiles, and secondary suspension faults. The simulated signals are then inputted into the
