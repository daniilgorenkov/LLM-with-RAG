Beyond its contribution to the national economy, railway transportation plays a significant role in reducing greenhouse gas emissions, thereby supporting the environmental goals of nations . According to the International Union of Railways, approximately eight billion passengers use train service annually, and rail transport helps to reduce traffic jams, saving countries close to $100 billion each year . Research indicates that 45.6% of the total
annual accidents are caused due to the derailment of wheels . While systems rely heavily on regular inspection,
these approaches are not capable of promptly detecting defects under extreme weather conditions. Hence, for effective and safe railway operations, real-time condition monitoring of wheelsets is highly critical for predictive
maintenance, reducing downtime, improving safety, and lowering lifecycle maintenance costs .. Railway
transportation is not ideal for existing condition monitoring systems, as they are limited to periodic inspections,
which are expensive and unreliable in the detection of defects in real-time . These systems are not used optimally
under many operating conditions because they struggle with unbalanced datasets and sparse annotations.de Comunicaciones, Universidad de Malaga, Campus de Teatinos, Málaga, Spain.

Internal structure of freight train wheelsets including tread, flange, axle, and axle bearing.Equation 1 represents the Hertzian contact stress equation for wheel rail interaction, where P(x, y) shows the pressure at a given coordinate on wheel-rail contact. P 0, a, b, and x, y shows the maximum contact pressure,

The structure of a train wheel consists of several components, including tread, flange, wheel plate, rim, and hub. Figures 1 and 2 presents that the tread is 12. cm wide, that ensures smooth contact with the track surface, while the flange is 2. cm wide, that prevents derailment by guiding the wheel along the rails. The wheel plate connects the rim to the hub, which is mounted on the axle, enabling the
wheel’s rotation. The wheelset consists of two wheels connected by a 1.75-meter long axle, matching the standard gauge track. Each wheel has a diameter of 1. meters and a circumference of 3. meters. Axle bearings enable
smooth, frictionless rotation of the wheels, ensuring stability during operation.Wheel defects often cause substantial accidents and substantial economic losses.Equation 3 represents the defect impact on train dynamics where F impact is the impact force, m is the mass ofEquation 4 represents the excitation frequency due to defect where f is the frequency impact, v is the trainThe most prevalent defects include flat spots, which typically result from wheel sliding . The major defects
after flat spots are shelling, cracks, scratches, and discoloration . Shelling is a result of surface fatigue that developswhen the wheel gets soft from excessive heat under braking, which creates fissures and spalls. Cracks grow from excessive pressure. Scratches and discoloration are caused by friction and wear. This can cause vibrations and
rails damage, which raises maintenance costs. The early diagnosis of wheel defects is crucial for the maintenanceDefect detection has become a critical technique in industrial applications, particularly in image processing,
where it is used to identify defects and errors. To address manual defect detection problems, deep learning (DL)
techniques have successfully been employed. Convolutional neural network (CNN) are most commonly used in image classification tasks to achieve better accuracy . For example, Mask R-CNN is a real-time object detection algorithm that is capable of pixel-level defect detection, which makes it a more reliable technique. Another prominent DL technique is YOLO, which is one of the most popular models to detect objects in real time .Equation 5 represents the DL model representation where S is the grid size, B is the number of bounding boxes

In railway systems, the defect detection process have evolved over
time and has significantly improved due to recent advancements in DL techniques.This research proposes an online defect detection system for operational train wheels, which effectively- The creation of the FaultSeg dataset, a publicly available dataset for training deep learning models on railway- A comprehensive evaluation of eight YOLO models and an RTD Transformer, highlighting their effectiveness- The deployment of the YOLOv5-seg model on an edge device, demonstrating its real-time defect detectionThe rest of the paper is organized as follows: Section “Related work” provides an overview of traditional and automated methods for defect detection using manual and DL based techniques. Section “Methods” details
the overall methodology of the research, including data collection, preprocessing, experimental setup,
instance segmentation and object detection implementation. Section “Results” discusses the analysis of model performance, including computing resources, hyperparameters, model evaluation, cross validation, comparison,

Section “Conclusion” concludes the paper and summarizes the key findings of this study.Traditional manual inspection methods, such as visual checks and wheel hammering, are limited in detecting subsurface defects and are prone to human error. These methods also struggle under varying environmental conditions. According to Sundaram and Zeid et al. , manual inspection methods yield an average accuracy rate of 80%, and it suffers from inconsistency. Researchers have investigated new sensor-based techniques to enhance
the reliability of detection methods. A reflective optical position sensor which uses laser-based displacement
analysis to detect wheel flats was proposed by Gao et al. . Similarly, Gazafrudi et al. created an advanced noncontact laser triangulation system that precisely measures wheel and rail corrugation and is more efficient than
manual and vibration-only assessments. But with the progress of technology more effective forms of condition
monitoring were researched, such as railway rolling noise analysis, time-frequency analysis, adaptive noisecancelling etc. During the time-frequency analysis, both time and frequency information are maintained forEquation 7 represents the mathematical model for traditional railway wheel inspection, where X ( t, f ), x ( τ ),
w ( t ), f, and e [j] [πft] represent the time-frequency representation, input signal from wheel vibration, window

flange angle, profile wear (contact area), track gauge compatibility, cross-section profile, wheelset load, and fatigue strength. However, in another study, Bevan et al. used magnetic flux techniques to detect wheel tread damage in railway wheels. However, Zhang et al. , utilized eddy current pulsed thermography for rolling contact fatigue crack detection in wheel tread. Additionally, Chen et al. introduced a two-level adaptive chirp mode decomposition method to detect wheel flats under variable speed and noise. Mosleh et al. developed a spectral kurtosis method for extracting wheel flat features from intricate vibration signals, which showed effective in operational environments. Xu et al. and Zhou et al. examined the mechanical effects of flats and polygonization, highlighting the pressing need of precise detection methods to reduce structural damages. All
these methods yielded more accurate results than traditional manual inspection and hammering. However, they required some manual intervention, which was susceptible to errors influenced by environmental conditionsEquation 8 represents the modeling of defect growth over time using fracture mechanics, whereare the crack growth rate per cycle, material-dependent constants, and stress intensity factor range, respectively.Equation 9 represents ∆ K, where Y, σ, and a are the correction factor based on crack geometry, applied stress,

cracks, as they can propagate undetected until reaching critical failure.(UT), Eddy Current Testing (ECT), and Magnetic Flux Leakage (MFL). The Ultrasonic Testing technique is
widely used for identifying internal cracks within wheel rims and hubs, while phased array UT enhances both coverage and resolution introduced by Fry et al. . Motion-Induced Eddy Current Array (MIECA), eddy current

These techniques provide real-time feedback, high sensitivity,After advancements in hardware capabilities and computational power, researchers began exploring new avenues for automation in industrial condition monitoring. In a study, Zhang et al. explored defect detection

Bernal et al. introduces a sensor node architecture for onboard railway wagon monitoring with an Analog Fault Detector that can save power and reduce hardware costs. However, Shruthi et al. discusses the use ofcracks, as well as machine-learning techniques for defect detection using tachographs on railway components.
However, Cavuto et al. used Finite Element Modeling (FEM) for optimizing test setups and improving laser ultrasonics defect detection capabilities in train wheelsets. The research presented an advanced FEM model
that replicated ultrasonic wave generation and propagation inside axle materials through air. The authors usedregions like wheel-axle fittings. The integration of edge computing and artificial intelligence (AI) models enables
new avenues for real-time defect detection. Wang et al. created a YOLOv5s-VF model for edge computing that achieves 93.5% rail defect detection accuracy and significantly reducing the computational power being
required. The STrans-YOLOX model integrates Swin Transformer with YOLOX to improve detection accuracy
of small and complex defects across different tracks and lighting conditions . These models prioritize longrange spatial dependencies, which leads to better performance than previous CNN-only models in complexof wheels. However, these methods rely on classical image processing algorithms, which are data-intensive andEquation 10 represents the machine learning (ML) based feature extraction for defect detection, where W 1, W 2,
and W 3 are the weight matrices of the convolutional layers, b 1, b 2, and b 3 are the biases, and σ ( · ) is the nonlinear activation function. It differentiates DL-based defect detection from traditional techniques.conditions. To overcome these challenges, Zhang et al. developed a Deep Extractor system that integratessurfaces. Soleimani et al. introduced an image-based profiling system for railway wheels that enables precise wear evaluation against CAD reference standards. However, CycleGAN represents a GAN-based technique that helps generate synthetic defect images for deep learning model training. GAN-based methods including CycleGAN developed by Guo et al. address data limitations through creation of synthetic defect images, which enhances deep learning model training. Edge computing-based train obstacle detection algorithms powered by
YOLOv3 have been proposed by Li et al. to save onboard equipment’s computation resources. Diagnostic toolsconducted by Belotti et al. . Additionally, ML models are proposed by Krummenacher et al. for automatic wheel defects detection using vertical force measurements from a sensor system on the railway network.
Moreover, the predictive maintenance framework was proposed by Shaikh et al. using various ML models
such as boosting and bagging algorithms to predict the failure of the air production unit (APU) in electric trains.
However, another study proposed by Shaikh et al. anchor-free YOLOv8 object detection model was used towheels. Qu et al. showed that IRT could detect wheel surface cracks and wear through temperature differential mapping. Active thermography identifies subsurface cracks through controlled heating and thermal response

There is ongoing discussion about the importance of large annotated datasets for the analysis of historical documents, and the value of annotating such
data to emphasize the role of visual inspection in automated systems. The hybrid approach of integrating a visual
inspection with YOLO models provides a balanced methodology, emphasizing the human visual aspect whileanalysis. Latest techniques for detecting defects in wheel images have been proposed by Redmon et al. , based on the improved YOLOX model. An approach named UT-YOLO has been developed by Zhang et al. to detect defects in the high-speed railway train wheel using the computer vision algorithm YOLO. Transformer models have been applied for Vision-based problems including object detection, defect detection, and multiple-object
tracking. It enhanced the detection accuracy in different applications [434445] . Despite advances in automation technologies, visual inspections utilize advanced tools to remain relevant. Remote inspection systems using thermal cameras, GoPro high resolution video, or drone-based recording can be used in ML pipelines for hybrid inspection frameworks proposed by . By integrating these technologies, higher efficiency was achieved while
enabling human expert evaluation of AI results that ensures safe operations in critical environments.Recent technological developments in AI and ML have significantly improved railway safety. In a study, Shaikh et

They created a cheap, AI driven, visual inspection system for real-time wheel defect detection with GoPro Hero 9 cameras to capture ultra high-resolution images. The system exemplifies the integration of AI and readily available hardware for self-trained, preemptive defect detection for operational safety are required for

The paper presents a novel machine learning-based system to detect and predict deterioration in railway turnouts caused by flooding. Using convolutional neural networks (CNN) trained on nonlinear finite

The model achieves over 98% accuracy in recognizing and classifying floodinduced deterioration, which can help schedule timely maintenance and enhance railway infrastructure
resilience. This intelligent automation offers a promising tool for managing railway infrastructure under extreme weather impacts. The integration of these advanced techniques with edge devices supports real-time adaptive
decision-making, which minimizes unexpected downtimes and strengthens operational resilience. Collectively,
models have played a key role in developing systems that can detect more defects efficiently. By combining visual

The supervised learning component relies on a predictive model developed from validated simulations, focusing on tread wear,
flange height, and flange thickness, which enhances prediction accuracy with an R² improvement from 0. to
0.95. Reinforcement learning complements this by optimizing maintenance scheduling decisions based on realtime operational parameters such as train weight, speed, and track characteristics, thereby minimizing the need
for constant inspections. The integration forms an agent that learns from wear states predicted by the supervised model and refines decision-making through feedback rewards, resulting in reduced maintenance costs, defect rates, and inspection times. Additionally applied artificial neural networks to predict wheel wear using historical wear measurements, achieving effective performance in wear forecasting through supervised training

Krummenacher et al. introduced novelautomated wheel defect detection, successfully outperforming classical detection methods for flat spots whileforce measurements from permanently installed sensor systems, achieving accuracy rates between 81–92% with their 2D-convolutional neural networks applied to time-domain data. Furthermore, comprehensive machine

recall, and mean average precision (mAP) while utilizing convolutional neural networks and computer visionconditions. Kaewunruen et al. investigates the use of machine learning as a non-destructive approach to assess the condition and dynamic properties of railway track components. The study develops and tests several machine
learning models including Linear Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors, Gradient Boosting, and Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN), finding that the tuned CNN model offers the highest accuracy with minimal error in
predicting dynamic properties from field measurements. This approach provides a fast, cost-effective alternative to traditional inspection methods, enabling efficient in-situ condition assessment without expensive equipment or lengthy analysis. The work highlights the potential of machine learning to improve railway maintenanceHowever, there is a significant gap that still needs to be addressed. Advanced models like Vision Transformers,

Future scalability and adoption of railway systems depend on the creation of models that perform reliably across different track and weather conditions. All these deficiencies need to be considered so that the defect

Certain trains depart from Karachi to Kotri Railway Station and continue to northern cities, including Mirpurkhas, Sialkot, Lahore, Peshawar, and Multan. The trains departing from Karachi and traveling northward are designated as up trains due to their direction towards the North. Nonetheless, certain trains from northern regions arrive at Kotri Railway Station

Figure 6 below shows the original image while Fig. below illustrates an example of a ground truth image with all 4 classes used in it. The data acquired from the wayside data acquisition system suffered from class imbalance problems. In order to deal with it, data augmentation
was performed on the dataset to balance out the classes and improve overall better performance of models.
Augmentation also enhanced the diversity of the FaultSeg dataset, and the generalization of models tested over
it. Figure 6 depicts an augmented image to enhance diversity in the dataset.Data augmentation included rotation, scaling, brightness adjustment, and Gaussian noise addition toEquation 20 represents the data augmentation transformation, where Rotation by θ degrees:Equations 20, 21, 22, 23 and 24 helps to simulate real-world variations in the dataset and increases robustnessThe dataset, acquired and developed by the authors of this research study using an indigenously designedThe initial data annotation in the FaultSeg dataset exhibited an imbalance in the distribution of defect class.

The dataset consists of 1,872 annotated images. After the implementation of augmentation techniques, there are a total of 22,464 images.Object detection and Instance segmentation play a crucial role in classification. Instance segmentation performs pixel-level classification, enabling the model to detect objects that are not easily visible. Wheel defect detection
is not as viable as standard object detection, as observed in experiments through object detection models, so it is preferred to use instance segmentation. Instance segmentation helps to pinpoint the position of every defective instance on an image with their assigned label.

The initial learning rate (lr0), momentum, and weight decay were fixed to stabilize the training of models. YOLO instance segmentation, object detection and RTD transformer models have multiple loss components: objectness loss, classification loss, and bounding box regression loss. The box
loss gains in YOLOv6, YOLOv8-seg, YOLOv9-seg, YOLOv11-seg, YOLOv12 and RTD transformer are set to a higher value (7.5) compared to earlier versions, emphasizing precise localization of bounding boxes. This
modification, along with deeper architecture, improves object detection and instance segmentation accuracy that reduces errors by increasing the model’s sensitivity to bounding-box predictions. Decoupled Focal Loss (DFL)
was set to 1. to help with the class imbalance problem. For the auto-augmentation method, randaugment technique was employed to apply a wide range of augmentations during training, with the aim to improve the generalizability of the models. These specific parameters were fine-tuned through extensive training to achieve the best possible results for each model. The hyperparameter chosen optimized the training time, minimized
redundancy and overfitting, maximized the model accuracy. This ensured an unbiased assessment of the modelTable 7 shows the results of different class-wise and overall metrics. It consists of precision, recall, and mean average precision (mAP) at an IoU threshold of 0. for all models on four classes. It can be observed that

of 0. among all models. YOLOv12 achieves highest precision of 100%, while YOLOv10 achieves highest recall
of 98%, and RTD achieves highest mAP@0. of 98%, and YOLOv8-seg balances near-perfect recall 98% and precision of 97%. Overall, the bar graph highlights uniformly high detection capability, with RTD transformer
and YOLOv8-seg as the most consistent and accurate contenders among all models.The results in Fig. provide valuable insights into the performance of all models:RTD Transformer performs the best overall with both precision and recall of 0.97, and mAP@0. of 0.98. It indicates that this model is highly effective in identifying all objects correctly. These improvements may be due
to changes in model architecture and training techniques in RTD transformers compared to YOLO models.Equation 29 represents the scaled dot-product attention where Q, K, V, dk are the query matrix, key matrix,dimension of keys and queries. To enhance more attention, multihead self-attention (MHSA) is used:**Fig. 8** . Performance metrics (Precision, Recall, mAP@0.5, and mAP@0.5:0.95) across training epochs of all**Fig. 9** . Comparison of Precision, Recall, and mAP@0. scores across all models.Equation 30 represents MHSA where head i = Attention( QWi [Q][, KW][ K] i [, V W][ V] i [)][ is the projective matrix and ]YOLOv8-seg performs better but not the best, with a recall of 0. and precision of 0. which indicates that this model is highly effective in not only detecting the objects (recall) but also identifying them correctly (precision).YOLOv12 has achieved recall of 0. but attains a perfect precision of 1. and strong mAP@0. of 0.97. It
indicates that v12 does not give any false positives and maintains localization accuracy.YOLOv10 shows the recall and mAP@0. of 0.98. It detects all objects keeping localization precise, while itsYOLOv6 and YOLOv7-seg are balanced with 0.95–0.97.95. metrics around all evaluation metrics. YOLOv7seg achieves mAP@0. of 0. that reflects consistent localization, on the other hand YOLOv6 has high recallThe precision, recall and mAP@0. of the YOLOv5-seg model are 0.95, 0.94, 0. respectively. It is a wellbalanced model with much better detection performance. It has good optimization that keep inference fast andBoth YOLOv9-seg and YOLOv11-seg achieves lower precision and recall score that is in between 0.91–0.95.91.95.
On the other hand, mAP@0. is between 0.92–0.93.92. that gives a hint of over-parametrization. Both have
architectural depth that increases training time and difficulty in training as well. It leads to under-generalizationInference speed is another important thing that influences preference for a given model.Equation 31 represents the computational complexity and latency where S is the grid size, B is the number of bounding boxes per grid cell, C is the number of detected classes, and FPS is the frame per second.terms of the number of weights, it is likely that its inference speed may increase incrementally compared to RTD
transformer and YOLOv7-seg, with much better performance metrics. YOLOv10 and YOLOv12 showed better detection performance, as YOLOv10 achieved the highest recall and YOLOv12 achieved perfect precision, but
they have moderate inference speed due to computational complexity. On the other hand, YOLOv6 is stable and maintain balanced performance with relatively faster inference. While YOLOv11-seg, YOLOv9-seg are the latest model, but both have been introduced with more layers or more computationally complex operations. It has even slower inference speeds compared to RTD transformers and YOLOv7-seg, thus contributing to its lower likely to have a much better inference speed than YOLOv8-seg, as it has undergone good optimization.monitoring; therefore, real-time evaluation of each model was extremely important. Each model was evaluateddetection of defects. Normalized confusion matrix was used for visualizing the accurate predictive ability of each model for individual classes, i.e., Cracks-Scratches, Discoloration, Shelling, Wheels, and Background, as shown
in Fig. 10. During real-time evaluation, it is noted that YOLOv8-seg struggled to accurately identify the shellingclass, whereas YOLOv9-seg and YOLOv12 faced challenges in identifying Cracks/Scratches due to the similarity of low-level features and their inherent complexity. These variations in model performance, particularly for TP and FP, can intuitively be attributed to several factors. YOLOv5-seg demonstrated robust feature extraction capabilities, enabling it to detect the most shelling instances. YOLOv6 and YOLOv10 exhibited moderate
performance but misclassified between background and shelling. However, RTD transformer and YOLOv7-seg demonstrated the most consistent performance. YOLOv11-seg had good results in identifying wheel defects but
also faced issues with shelling. Despite YOLOv12 and YOLOv9-seg architectural advancements, they exhibited
generalization problems, whereas RTD achieved the best balance across all classes.series models and a transformer model. The performance of each model is evaluated based on Precision, Recall,
mAP50, and mAP50-95. Each metric is represented with a distinct color: green for Precision, orange for Recall,
blue for mAP50, and purple for mAP50-95. The RTD transformer achieved the overall best performance,
with high Precision, Recall, mAP50, and mAP50-95 scores. YOLOv8 showed balanced performance across all metrics, particularly exceeding in mAP50, while its mAP50-95 is slightly lower. On the other hand, YOLOv6
performed the lowest across all metrics, especially in Recall and mAP50-95. Overall, RTD has the highest score,
while YOLOv12, YOLOv6 and YOLOv9-seg achieved the lowest Recall and mAP50-95.Figure 12 shows the training and validation loss curves for box and segmentation/DFL loss model training.
The RTD transformers and YOLOv7-seg had the lowest training and validation loss across 100 epochs, indicating superior stability and model convergence, generalization for both detection and segmentation applications.
YOLOv5-seg and YOLOv6 also showed stable training, with slight higher but smooth loss curves. In contrast,
YOLOv8-seg, YOLOv9-seg, YOLOv11-seg, YOLOv12 exhibited higher training and validation losses, while YOLOv9 and YOLOv12 showed the slowest convergence and the most persistent loss values. Overall, the RTD transformer showed the best learning dynamics, supporting its superior performance observed in detection metrics and based on Table 7 and Fig. 9, RTD transformer emerges as the best model, with balanced accuracy,The heatmap shown in Fig. compares the performance (Precision, Recall, mAP50, mAP50-95) of YOLOv5-YOLOv12 instance segmentation, object detection and RTD transformer over the last 50 epochs.
YOLOv9-seg consistently outperforms the other models in every metric with better precision, recall, and
mAP. While YOLOv8-seg shows low precision, particularly in the late epochs that exhibit higher false positive
rates. YOLOv6, YOLOv10, and YOLOv12 exhibit steady performance gains, contributing to the overall trend of improvement across models. YOLOv5-seg and YOLOv7-seg show very similar performance; each model is**Fig. 10** . Normalized confusion matrix of all models, showing classification performance across defect**Fig. 11** .

The heatmap also shows overall performance improvement through the epochs for all models, although at different rates of improvement varies. The heatmap also highlights consistent performance
improvement across all models, with YOLOv11-seg and RTD transformers showing steady advancements. These findings provide an indication that additional hyperparameter tuning can be made, especially for YOLOv8-seg,approaches by identifying a broader range of defects, including Shelling, Discoloration, and Cracks/Scratches.
This technique is highly accurate. On the other hand, the selection of the final model is considered on the basis of Flops (Floating point operations), number of parameters and accuracy in edge device. YOLOv5-seg has the
lowest parameters (1. million) and Flops (4. billion), while moderate precision (91%) recall (90%) and mAP50
(92%) in cross validation, representing the most efficient choice for deployment on an edge device. The RTDtransformer has the highest number of parameters, flops and accuracy, but it is not the best choice for edge
device, so YOLOv5-seg is chosen as it has superior performance in accurately detecting railway wheel defectsTable 8 presents a comprehensive comparative analysis of previous studies and the proposed deep learningbased approach for railway wheel defect detection. It systematically outlines the evolution of machine learning and computer vision techniques from 2018 to 2024, emphasizing variations in model architectures, dataset characteristics, hyperparameters, and performance metrics. The comparison highlights that earlier studies
primarily focused on limited defect classes such as normal, flat, and spalling, achieving moderate accuracy levels, whereas the proposed model incorporates four defect categories–wheel, shelling, crack/scratch, and
discoloration–using high-resolution imagery and advanced architectures like YOLO and RTD Transformer.
Demonstrating a significant improvement in precision (97%), recall (97%), and mAP@0. (98%), the proposed system surpasses prior works in both detection accuracy and real-time efficiency, thereby establishing a robust
framework for reliable, real-time condition monitoring in railway operations.The best-trained model was deployed on an edge device to evaluate the system’s performance in real-world.
Figure 14 shows the interface of the TrainScan: AI mobile application, where users can either upload images from storage or tap on the camera icon to capture live video streams. In both scenarios, the defects on the
surface of a railway wheel were detected in real time without the aid of additional hardware. This is important as it enables the automation of highly predictive features at the point of inspection, which mitigates downtime andThis study demonstrates the importance of real-time monitoring for railway wheelsets, which are critical to the safety and reliability of railway systems. The proposed framework, which combines YOLO instance
segmentation, object detection models, and the RTD Transformer, effectively identifies railway wheel defects.
YOLOv5-seg achieved 91% precision, 90% recall, and 92% mAP@0. in cross-validation, showcasing its strong performance. Additionally, it excels in real-time defect detection with a processing speed of 30 FPS and 30 ms
latency, making it the most reliable solution for operational railway environments. While other models, such
as YOLOv6, YOLOv7-seg, YOLOv8-seg, YOLOv9-seg, YOLOv11-seg, YOLOv12, and RTD Transformers, also
demonstrated strong performance, YOLOv5-seg remains the best choice for defect detection due to its balanced**Fig. 12** . Training and validation box and segmentation loss trends for all models over 100 epochs.precision, recall, and real-time efficiency.Despite these successes, challenges remain, particularly in detecting defects in heavily occluded or small regions. Future work will focus on incorporating sensor data for enhanced
defect detection and scaling the system to support extensive real-time monitoring of train systems, ultimately**Fig. 13** .
