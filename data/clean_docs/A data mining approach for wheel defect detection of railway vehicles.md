ABSTRACT: The combination of tight maintenance budgets and aging railway systems draw attention to the urgent need for costeffective and efficient approaches to monitor and detect damages in railway systems. Structural Health Monitoring (SHM) has been used by many researchers in railway systems to evaluate the health condition of railway assets. However, it demands advanced data analytics due to the large datasets generated from sensor networks. Data mining is a promising computational tool
that is qualified for the data extraction process. It can accurately find out the informative features, i.e., knowledge from the generated sensed data. Train wheels play a crucial role in ensuring the safe and efficient operation of trains. Defective wheels in freight railway waggons create a significant risk to railway infrastructure, often leading to considerable damage. A wheel flat occurs when a wheel becomes locked and slides along the rail, highlighting the critical importance of maintaining wheel integrity
for overall railway safety. This paper presents a data-driven train wheel defect detection concept which utilises the raw acceleration responses. This data is extracted from a finite element model of Train-Track Interaction (TTI) system. A generalised form ofDiscovery in Databases (KDD), SEMMA, DMAIC, CRISPDM, etc. –.
