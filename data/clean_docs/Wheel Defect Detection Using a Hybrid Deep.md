Abstract:** Defective wheels pose a significant challenge in railway transportation, impacting operational performance and safety. Excessive traction and braking forces give rise to deviations from the intended conical tread shape, resulting in amplified vibrations and noise. Moreover, these deviations contribute to the accelerated damage of track components. Detecting wheel defects at an early stage is
crucial to ensure safe and comfortable operation, as well as to minimize maintenance costs. However,
the presence of various vibrations, such as those induced by the track, traction motors, and other rolling stock subsystems, poses a significant challenge for onboard detection techniques. Theseactivities, often resulting in false alarms. This research paper aims to address this issue by using ausing accelerometer data. The proposed approach aims to enhance wheel defect detection accuracy while considering onboard techniques’ cost-effectiveness and efficiency. A realistic simulation model of the railway wheelset is developed to generate a comprehensive dataset. To generate vibration data in various scenarios, the model is simulated for 20 s under different conditions, including one
non-faulty scenario and six faulty scenarios. The simulations are conducted at different speeds and track conditions to capture a wide range of operating conditions. Within each simulation iteration,
a total of 200,000 data points are generated, providing a comprehensive dataset for analysis and evaluation. The generated data are then utilized to train and evaluate a hybrid deep learning model,
employing a multi-layer perceptron (MLP) as a feature extractor and multiple machine learning models (support vector machine, random forest, decision tree, and k-nearest neighbors) for performance
comparison. The results demonstrate that the MLP-RF (multi-layer perceptron with random forest)
model achieved an accuracy of 99%, while the MLP-DT (multi-layer perceptron with decision tree)
model achieved an accuracy of 98%. These high accuracy values indicate the effectiveness of the models in accurately classifying and predicting the outcomes. The contributions of this research work

and the application of deep learning techniques for improved wheel flat detections.**Keywords:** wheel defects; deep learning; wheel flats; false flange; nonlinear dynamics; MLPThe railway wheelset plays a vital role in railway transportation, ensuring the safe and comfortable operation of the vehicles. The conical shape of the wheel tread is designed to maintain optimal performance. However, excessive traction and braking forces at the wheel–rail interface can cause the wheel’s exterior perimeter to deviate from its desired
conical shape. This either results in a flat or more conical surface of the wheel tread.This deviation leads to increased vibrations, noise, and a decrease in ride comfort and operational safety. Moreover, wheel defects contribute to the accelerated growth of cracks
on the rail tracks, ultimately leading to premature failure of the rail system . Statisticalfaults accounted for 44.7% of train accidents, making them the most significant cause .
Therefore, early detection of defective wheels is crucial. To achieve this, an automatedto be developed. Consequently, there is a great interest among railway administrations andperiodically in workshops. Periodic inspection is expensive due to the unavailability of rolling stock during maintenance time. Moreover, it is also inefficient, which usually results
in over- or under-maintenance of the components . In the last few decades, various techniques have been employed in the railway industry, and various monitoring approaches have been proposed to automatically inspect wheel conditions. Most of these techniques are based on the concept that the wheel–rail interaction forces increase in a defective wheel . The most popular techniques which have gained plenty of attention from railway researchers are the onboard techniques and wayside measurement techniques .track at specific locations, allowing for the evaluation of all passing wheels . These techniques utilize vibration, acoustic, image detection, and ultrasonic technologies to
monitor the condition of the trains [10–12]. Hot axle box detectors (HABDs) are commonlyusing thermal imaging. However, HABDs are unable to detect damage at early stages,
as minor faults do not typically cause a noticeable increase in temperature. Additionally,
HABDs are prone to false alarms triggered by environmental conditions . Tracksidenoise produced by passing axle bearings. However, the operating frequency range of these microphones (normally 22–44 kHz) makes them susceptible to errors resulting from background noise . To enhance the accuracy of detection, many modern wayside monitoring systems incorporate machine learning and deep learning algorithms . For

Moreover, this method also requires detailed information about a target vehicle (e.g., number of axles and type of wagon) for accurate condition monitoring .use. Additionally, the deployment and security of wayside equipment are important
Due to the challenges associated with wayside monitoring techniques, several onboard techniques have been proposed in the literature [18–23]. One such technique, presented

In , a lightweight is presented for wheel flat (WF) detection using car body accelerations. Additionally,
model-based onboard techniques are proposed in [20–23] to detect wheelset conditions under different environmental conditions, utilizing axle vibration and gyroscopic data for The advantage of on-board monitoring systems is that the wheel is monitored continuously and not only when the vehicle passes a trackside monitoring site. This allows for the timely detection of emerging wheel defects , thus, allowing immediate action to perform maintenance after the formation of a wheel flat, without requiring a visit to a trackside monitoring site . Furthermore, if the onboard monitoring system provides positioning, the occurrence of a wheel defect can be linked to a position on the track. The
track at this position can then be inspected and, in cases where a track defect is identified,other passing vehicles . The early detection of wheel flats can also be correlated with braking occurrences, if the braking system is monitored, to develop strategies for reducing their frequency . However, onboard detection methods require equipping all wheels with sensors for comprehensive diagnosis and effective wheel condition monitoring, whichdiverse vibrations originating from multiple sources within the railway system. These vibrations, generated by the track, traction motors, and various rolling stock subsystems,defects in real-time during operational activities . The intricate nature of these vibrations makes it difficult to distinguish between genuine wheel defects and false alarms,
leading to potential disruptions and unnecessary maintenance interventions. Addressingseparate the signals related to wheel defects from the surrounding vibrations. By employing machine learning algorithms, it becomes possible to enhance the accuracy of onboard detection systems and mitigate the impact of background vibrations. These techniques aim to extract relevant features and patterns associated with wheel defects, enabling reliable
and real-time identification even in the presence of complex vibration environments .
This paper presents a novel technique to address the challenges faced by onboard techniques. The proposed technique utilizes axle vibration data exclusively, thereby reducing
the reliance on multiple sensors. Moreover, the proposed technique incorporates a hybrid
deep learning approach, which plays a crucial role in mitigating the influence of background vibrations. The utilization of hybrid deep learning algorithms allows for enhancedthe vibrations induced by the track, traction motors, and other rolling stock subsystems.

This pre-training step helps the MLP extract meaningful patterns from the vibration data,
facilitating effective feature extraction. Once the MLP is pre-trained, the last classification layer is removed. Instead, the layer where the outputs of all three branches are concatenated is used to extract the features learned by the MLP. This concatenated layer combines the features extracted from each parallel network with the input layer, providing a comprehensive
