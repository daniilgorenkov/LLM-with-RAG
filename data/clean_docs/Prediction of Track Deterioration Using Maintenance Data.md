The implementation and verification process of the SVR to model the track deterioration is similar to that in the ANN, although the input data need to be scaled down to reduce the numerical errors during the calculation of the kernel functions (Chang and Lin 2011).## Application of Machine Learning Schemes to TQI PredictionThe influential parameters of the track geometry were introduced in the previous section and, based on these parameters, the data-driven prediction models of the track deterioration were validated using numerical data. As mentioned previously, the measurement data of the high-speed rail are not available at this moment, and artificial data close to the field conditions are generated using the parameters shown in Tables 1–3. In the beginning, a total of 100 segments were produced for each case, and a mean deterioration rate, ro, similar to Caetano and Teixeira (2016) was assigned to every segment. Since the total parameters considered in Tables 1–3 were 3 × 3 × 3 in our case, a total of 2,700 segments having initial values of TQI, TQIi;o, and the number of tampings shown in Fig.  were artificially created using a random number generator. From these, the current TQI values were calculated based on the deterioration rate, ri, in Eq. (3), and 27 different tamping ratios in Tables 1–3 were used as multipliers, χ, in Eq. (3) so that the variations of the deterioration rate owing to the influential parameters were obtained. Furthermore, perturbation on the deterioration rate was made by adding a perturbation parameter, κ, shown in Table 4 to the deterioration rate such that the perturbed deterioration rate, riu, has the form of a normal distributionsee Fig.  for some of the TQI development according to MGT and κ in Eq. (16). In Fig. 5, the warning level of TQI is 1.  mm and the number of tampings to renew the track system including ballast is 5 so that, when the tamping is applied to a specific segment for at least 5 times, the track system is renewed. After renewal, TQI is assumed to be the same as the initial TQI value. Table 4 shows the parameters used in the analysis and the numerical values in the parenthesis are for the comparison only.Two cases of machine learning schemes were considered to compare the results between the ANN and SVR, obtained by using a commercial mathematical package, MATLAB, Version 2016. In addition, the results using LIBSVM (Chang and Lin 2011) were also studied to check the difference of the optimization algorithms considered in Eq. (12).## Case 1: ML Model with Latest Measurement Data SetThe ANN model with the latest measurement data is illustrated in Fig.  and, except for the influential parameters shown in**----- Start of picture text -----**

**----- End of picture text -----**Tables 1–3, MGT, the number of tampings and the initial TQI value after the construction or ballast renewal are added in the training model. In other words, Case 1 is similar to the curve fit in Fig.  with the minimum amount of data, and the SVR as well as ANN use the same set of data having 85% of the data to train and the remaining 15% to test. The relationship between prediction and target values can be visualized by the correlation coefficient, R, or by the mean square error (MSE), and the corresponding results are shown in Fig. 7. As can be expected, when the perturbation parameter, κ, of Eq. (16) is increased, the deterioration rate becomes linear and the prediction errors will be decreased accordingly. A similar tendency can be expected when LIBSVM is used, although the prediction errors are slightly increased when κ is small. This is because the optimization scheme used in LIBSVM is different from## Case 2: ML Model with Series of Measurement Data SetThe ML model with the series of measurement data is next considered and, in this case, the measurement data of TQI and MGT values after the construction or ballast renewal are used. Fig.  shows the network model, and the number of data set will be the parameter to be decided through the application of available data from the TMV. During the maintenance work of the high-speed rail, the track inspection is carried out by the TMV every month based on the inspection manual, and the necessary data will therefore be available for each month. Fig.  illustrates the R and MSE according to the number of measurement months, as well as κ, and it can be concluded that the total number of measurement data of at least 24 months will provide a stable result. Also shown in the figure is the result of Case 1 with 1 set of data, and it is clear that Case 2,Thus far, the ANN and SVR of the ML schemes have been applied to model the track deterioration and the results can be directly used to predict the future maintenance work of the ballasted track. The training of the network used the simulation data based on the field conditions, and an additional perturbation term, κ, was also introduced during the estimation of the deterioration rate so that a TQI measurement with noise terms can be modeled with the proposed model. The proposed model is also expected to apply to the general cases of ballasted track because the most influential factors of track deterioration, such as substructure, curvature, and train speed, are evaluated from the field maintenance data.## ConclusionsData-driven models of track deterioration have been investigated in this study by using SVR as well as ANN, and the applicability of the ML schemes has been verified with the simulation data, which are close to the field conditions. The estimated TQI data were retrieved considering the influential parameters of the ballasted track, such as type of substructure, track curvature, and velocity**----- Start of picture text -----**
